ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Background

Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, we operate an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries through hubs and gateways in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2018, approximately 204 million passengers boarded our flights.

2018 Financial Overview 

Fuel Costs and the U.S. Airline Industry

While 2018 marked another profitable year for the U.S. airline industry, higher fuel costs significantly impacted industry results. With respect to fuel costs, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel, which jet fuel prices tend to follow, was on average approximately 33% higher in 2018 as compared to 2017. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during 2018 was $72 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $54 per barrel during 2017. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during 2018 between a high of $86 per barrel to a low of $50 per barrel, and closed the year on December 31, 2018 at $54 per barrel. Brent crude oil prices were higher in the 2018 period due principally to reductions of global inventories driven by strong demand and continued production restraint led primarily by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). U.S. sanctions against Iran, coupled with declining output from Venezuela further limited supply. Concerns about slowing global growth and lower demand for oil surfaced in the fourth quarter of 2018 causing Brent crude oil prices to drop. With respect to revenue, the network U.S. airlines reported positive unit revenue growth in 2018 driven by strong demand and higher yields as airlines attempted to pass along the cost of rising fuel prices. The positive unit revenue growth in 2018 was led by international markets, primarily in the Atlantic market, with the domestic market also contributing to the growth.

See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business,” “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity” and “Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.”

AAG’s 2018 Results

The selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

We adopted three new accounting standards as of January 1, 2018: the New Lease Standard, the New Revenue Standard and the New Retirement Standard. The 2017 and 2016 financial information presented within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard and the New Retirement Standard. The New Lease Standard did not require the recast of prior periods. See Note 1(b) to AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for further information on the impacts of these new accounting standards.

Pre-Tax Income and Net Income

Pre-tax income and net income were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, respectively. This compares to 2017 pre-tax income and net income of $3.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The year-over-year declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by a 29.0% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel. This increase was offset in part by higher revenues driven by strong demand.

Revenue

In 2018, we reported total operating revenues of $44.5 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 4.5%, as compared to 2017. Passenger revenues were $40.7 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 3.9%, as compared to 2017. The increase in passenger revenues was due to a 2.1% increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and a 1.8% increase in yields driven by strong demand. Domestic yields increased 0.9% and international yields rose 4.2%, led by a 5.3% increase in yield in the Atlantic market.

In 2018, cargo revenue was $1.0 billion, an increase of $123 million, or 13.8%, as compared to 2017, primarily driven by increases in domestic and international freight yields and international freight volume. Other revenue, driven by higher loyalty revenue, increased $251 million, or 9.7%, in 2018 as compared to 2017.

49

Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 15.79 cents in 2018, a 2.4% increase as compared to 15.42 cents in 2017. 

Fuel

Our mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $9.9 billion in 2018, which was $2.4 billion, or 31.8%, higher as compared to 2017. This increase was driven primarily by a 29.0% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel to $2.23 in 2018 from $1.73 in 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.

Other Costs

We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.

Our 2018 total cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 14.85 cents, an increase of 6.9%, from 13.88 cents in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs as described above.

Our 2018 CASM excluding special items and fuel was 11.06 cents, an increase of 1.4%, from 10.90 cents in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries, wages and benefits.

For a reconciliation of CASM excluding special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $4.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and $2.8 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. We also had restricted cash and short-term investments of $154 million. 

During 2018, we completed the following financing transactions:

•Refinanced a $1.8 billion term loan facility at a lower interest rate and extended the maturity from 2020 to 2025;

•Raised $1.9 billion in proceeds from aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposit debt financing, of which approximately $513 million was used to repay existing indebtedness;

•Raised approximately $1.1 billion in proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions;

•Raised an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility; and 

•Increased our revolving credit facility commitments by $343 million, extended their maturities from 2022 to 2023 and improved their undrawn economics.

See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on our debt obligations.

Additionally, we returned $986 million to our stockholders in 2018, consisting of $186 million in dividend payments and the repurchase of $800 million of AAG common stock, or 16.6 million shares at a weighted average cost per share of $48.15.

AAG’s Results of Operations

Operating Statistics

The table below sets forth selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Revenue passenger mile (RPM) – A basic measure of sales volume. One RPM represents one passenger flown one mile.

(b) Available seat mile (ASM) – A basic measure of production. One ASM represents one seat flown one mile.

(c) Passenger load factor – The percentage of available seats that are filled with revenue passengers.

(d) Yield – A measure of airline revenue derived by dividing passenger revenue by RPMs.

(e) Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) – Passenger revenues divided by ASMs.

(f) Total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) – Total revenues divided by ASMs.

(g) Operating cost per available seat mile (CASM) – Operating expenses divided by ASMs.

Results of Operations – 2018 Compared to 2017

Pre-tax income and net income were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, respectively. This compares to 2017 pre-tax income and net income of $3.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data –“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

The year-over-year declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by an increase in fuel costs, which was offset in part by higher revenues driven by strong demand.

Operating Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

51

This table presents our total passenger revenue and the year-over-year change in certain operating statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Passenger revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 3.9%, in 2018 from 2017 due to a 2.1% year-over-year increase in RPMs and a 1.8% increase in yields driven by continued strong demand. Domestic yield increased 0.9% and international yields increased 4.2%, led by a 5.3% increase in yield in the Atlantic market. 

Cargo revenue increased $123 million, or 13.8%, from 2017 driven primarily by increases in domestic and international freight yields and international freight volume.

Other revenue increased $251 million, or 9.7%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily driven by higher revenue associated with our loyalty program. In 2018 and 2017, loyalty revenue included in other revenue was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. 

Total operating revenues in 2018 increased $1.9 billion, or 4.5%, from 2017 driven principally by a 3.9% increase in passenger revenue as described above. Our TRASM was 15.79 cents in 2018, a 2.4% increase as compared to 15.42 cents in 2017.

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total operating expenses increased $3.5 billion, or 9.1%, in 2018 from 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in total CASM.

Total CASM

We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.

52

The table below presents the reconciliation of total operating expenses (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses total operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.

The major components of our total CASM and our total CASM excluding special items and fuel for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding):

Operating Special Items, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.

(2) Merger integration expenses included costs associated with integration projects, principally our flight attendant, human resources and payroll, and technical operations systems.

(3) Severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.

(4) Settlement of a private party antitrust lawsuit. See Note 12(e) - “Private Party Antitrust Action Related to Passenger Capacity” to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further discussion.

(5) Intangible asset impairment includes a non-cash charge to write-off our Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement.

(6) Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of our common stock are marked-to-market based on our stock price.

(7) Employee bonus expense included costs related to the $1,000 cash bonus and associated payroll taxes granted to mainline employees as of December 31, 2017 in recognition of H.R. 1, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act).

Nonoperating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $24 million, or 25.8%, in 2018 principally due to a 103 basis point increase in average yields in 2018 as compared to 2017.

54

In 2018, other nonoperating income, net principally included $308 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, which reflects an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets in 2018 as compared to 2017. This income was offset in part by a $104 million net special charge for mark-to-market unrealized losses associated with certain of our equity investments, $55 million of net foreign currency losses principally associated with certain Latin American currencies and $13 million of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.

In 2017, other nonoperating income, net principally included $138 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, offset in part by $22 million of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments and $4 million of net foreign currency losses.

Income Taxes

In 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $472 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash. This provision included an $18 million special income tax charge related to an international income tax matter. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $10.2 billion of federal NOLs and $3.2 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which we expect to be available in 2019 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.

In 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $2.1 billion, which was substantially non-cash. This provision included a special, non-cash income tax charge of $823 million to reflect the impact of lower corporate income tax rates on our deferred tax asset and liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 

See Note 7 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.

Results of Operations – 2017 Compared to 2016 

Pre-tax income and net income were $3.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 2017, respectively. This compares to 2016 pre-tax income and net income of $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $4.2 billion and $4.9 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For reconciliation of pre-tax income excluding special items to their comparable measures on a GAAP basis, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data –“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

The year-over-year declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by an increase in fuel costs and higher wage rates.

Operating Revenues

This table presents our total passenger revenue and the year-over-year change in certain operating statistics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

55

Passenger revenue increased $2.1 billion, or 5.6%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to a 4.3% year-over-year increase in yields driven by strong demand. Domestic yield increased 4.8% and international yields rose 4.0%, due principally to improved performance in Latin America.

Cargo revenue increased $105 million, or 13.3%, in 2017 from 2016 driven primarily by an increase in freight volume.

Other revenue increased $289 million, or 12.5%, in 2017 from 2016 driven by higher revenue associated with our loyalty program. In 2017 and 2016, loyalty revenue included in other revenue was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. 

Total operating revenues in 2017 increased $2.5 billion, or 6.2%, from 2016 driven principally by a 5.6% increase in passenger revenue as described above. Our TRASM was 15.42 cents in 2017, a 5.0% increase as compared to 14.68 cents in 2016.

Operating Expenses

Nonoperating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $31 million, or 47.8%, principally due to a 50 basis point increase in average yields in 2017 as compared to 2016.

Interest expense, net increased $62 million in 2017 primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with our fleet renewal program.

Other nonoperating income, net in 2017 and 2016, principally included $138 million and $77 million, respectively, of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, which reflects an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets in 2017 as compared to 2016. In 2017 and 2016, this income was offset in part by $22 million and $49 million, respectively, of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments. 

58

Income Taxes

In 2017 and 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which was substantially non-cash. Substantially all of our income before income taxes was attributable to the United States. 

In 2017, we recorded a special, non-cash income tax charge of $823 million to reflect the impact of lower corporate income tax rates on our deferred tax asset and liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

In 2017 and 2016, this income was offset in part by $22 million and $49 million, respectively, of net special charges associated with debt refinancings and extinguishments.

Income Taxes

American is part of the AAG consolidated income tax return.

64

In 2017 and 2016, American recorded an income tax provision of $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which was substantially non-cash. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes was attributable to the United States.

In 2017, American recorded a special, non-cash income tax charge of $924 million to reflect the impact of lower corporate income tax rates on the Company’s deferred tax asset and liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

See Note 5 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2018, AAG had approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity and $154 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail of our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Share Repurchase Programs

In April 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2020. Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. As of December 31, 2018, there was $1.7 billion remaining authority to repurchase shares under our new $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases that may be made from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.

In 2018, we repurchased 16.6 million shares of AAG common stock for $800 million at a weighted average cost per share of $48.15. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014 through December 31, 2018, we have repurchased 278.9 million shares of AAG common stock for $11.3 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $40.69.

Cash Dividends

Our Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In January 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend for stockholders of record on February 6, 2019, and payable on February 20, 2019.

Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.

Collateral-Related Covenants

Certain of our debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to appraise the related collateral annually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the collateral coverage tests for our term loans and revolving credit facilities as of the most recent measurement dates. For further information regarding our collateral-related covenants, see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.

Sources and Uses of Cash

AAG

2018 Compared to 2017 

Operating Activities

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion and $4.7 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $1.2 billion. This decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to lower profitability in 2018 driven by an increase in fuel costs, which was offset in part by higher revenues.

Investing Activities

Our net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion and $3.6 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Our principal investing activities in 2018 included expenditures of $3.7 billion for property and equipment, including 16 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft, six Boeing 787 family aircraft and five Embraer E175 aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.4 billion of net proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $293 million in net sales of short-term investments.

Our principal investing activities in 2017 included expenditures of $6.0 billion for property and equipment, including 20 Airbus A321 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Embraer E175 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft. We also made a $203 million equity investment in China Southern Airlines. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.3 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $947 million of net proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, and a $309 million decrease in restricted short-term investments.

Financing Activities

Our net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Our principal financing activities in 2018 included $2.9 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.4 billion in scheduled debt repayments and $513 million in the prepayment of secured loans. We also had $837 million in share repurchases and $186 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by net proceeds of $2.4 billion from the issuance of debt, consisting of $1.9 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs) and the financing of certain aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposits, as well as an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility.

Our principal financing activities in 2017 included $2.3 billion in scheduled debt repayments, $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $198 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by net proceeds of $3.1 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.0 billion of EETCs and $1.0 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. 

2017 Compared to 2016

Operating Activities

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion and $6.5 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $1.8 billion. This decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to lower profitability in 2017 driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates, which were offset in part by higher revenues.

Investing Activities

Our net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion and $5.7 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

66

Our principal investing activities in 2017 included expenditures of $6.0 billion for property and equipment, including 20 Airbus A321 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Embraer E175 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft.

Our principal investing activities in 2016 included expenditures of $5.7 billion for property and equipment, including 25 Airbus A321 aircraft, 24 Embraer E175 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 18 Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft, eight Boeing 787 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft.

Financing Activities

Our net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion and $894 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Our principal financing activities in 2017 included $2.3 billion in scheduled debt repayments, $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $198 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by net proceeds of $3.1 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.0 billion of EETCs and $1.0 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. 

Our principal financing activities in 2016 included $4.5 billion in share repurchases, $3.8 billion in debt repayments, including the repayment of $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of the tranche B-2 and tranche B-1 term loans, respectively, under a credit facility for which Citicorp was the Administrative Agent (the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility), and $224 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by net proceeds of $7.7 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.8 billion of EETCs, $2.3 billion provided under term loan facilities and $1.8 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft.

American

2018 Compared to 2017

Operating Activities

American’s net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion and $2.9 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, a year-over-year decrease of $927 million. This decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to lower profitability in 2018 driven by an increase in fuel costs, which was offset in part by higher revenues.

Investing Activities

American’s net cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion and $3.6 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

American’s principal investing activities in 2018 included expenditures of $3.7 billion for property and equipment, including 16 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft, six Boeing 787 family aircraft and five Embraer E175 aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.4 billion of net proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $293 million in net sales of short-term investments.

American’s principal investing activities in 2017 included expenditures of $5.9 billion for property and equipment, including 20 Airbus A321 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Embraer E175 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft. American also made a $203 million equity investment in China Southern Airlines. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.3 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $922 million of net proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, and a $309 million decrease in restricted short-term investments.

Financing Activities

American’s net cash used in financing activities was $147 million in 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities was $668 million in 2017.

American’s principal financing activities in 2018 included $2.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $1.9 billion in scheduled debt repayments and $513 million in the prepayment of secured loans. These cash outflows were offset in part by net proceeds of $2.4 billion from the issuance of debt, consisting of $1.9 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposits, as well as an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility.

67

American’s principal financing activities in 2017 included net proceeds of $3.1 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.0 billion of EETCs and $1.0 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $2.3 billion in scheduled debt repayments. 

2017 Compared to 2016 

Operating Activities

American’s net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $1.1 billion. AAG has the ability to move funds freely between its subsidiaries to support its cash requirements. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to a decrease in intercompany cash transfers from American to AAG. This increase in operating cash flows was offset in part by lower profitability in 2017 driven by higher fuel costs and wage rates, which were offset in part by higher revenues.

Investing Activities

American’s net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion and $5.6 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

American’s principal investing activities in 2017 included expenditures of $5.9 billion for property and equipment, including 20 Airbus A321 aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Embraer E175 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft.

American’s principal financing activities in 2017 included net proceeds of $3.1 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.0 billion of EETCs and $1.0 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $2.3 billion in scheduled debt repayments.

American’s principal financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds of $7.7 billion from the issuance of debt, including the issuance of $2.8 billion of EETCs, $2.3 billion provided under term loan facilities and $1.8 billion borrowed in connection with the financing of certain aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by $3.8 billion in debt repayments, including the repayment of $588 million and $970 million in remaining principal of the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility tranche B-2 and tranche B-1 term loans, respectively. 

Commitments

For further information regarding our commitments, see the Notes to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and the Notes to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.

68

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 12(d) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 10(d) to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B. 

Pass-Through Trusts

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with EETCs, issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.

Each trust covers a set number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2018, $11.6 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircraft’s fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $352 million as of December 31, 2018. 

Letters of Credit and Other

We provide financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or restricted cash and investments, primarily to support projected workers’ compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December 31, 2018, we had $460 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2022.

69

Contractual Obligations

The following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.

(i) Includes purchase commitments for jet fuel, construction projects and information technology support.

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions

In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft, the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, and future pension funding obligations, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks, natural disasters or other causes could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.

In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.

Our Board of Directors has from time to time authorized programs to repurchase shares of our common stock, one of which is currently in effect, and may authorize additional share repurchase programs in the future.

OTHER INFORMATION

Basis of Presentation

See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.

Passenger Revenue

We recognize all revenues generated from transportation on American and our regional flights operated under the brand name American Eagle, including associated baggage fees, ticketing change fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. 

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, 

71

certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. 

Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

Loyalty Revenue

We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel awards such as hotels and rental cars. For mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members, we apply the deferred revenue method in accordance with the New Revenue Standard.

Mileage credits earned through travel

For mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted for an estimate of miles that will not be redeemed based on historical redemption patterns. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 10% increase in the estimated selling price of miles would have decreased revenues by approximately $100 million as a result of additional amounts deferred from passenger ticket sales. 

Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners 

We sell mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners including our co-branded credit card partners, under contracts with terms extending generally for one to nine years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically are within 30 days subsequent to the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners are comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.

Our most significant partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US that we entered into in 2016. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of intellectual property, including the American brand and access to loyalty program member lists, which is the predominant element in the agreements, as well as advertising (collectively, the marketing component). Accordingly, we recognize the marketing component in other revenue in the period of the mileage sale following the sales-based royalty method.

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable to transportation is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.

For the portion of our outstanding mileage credits that we estimate will not be redeemed, we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. Our estimates are based on analysis of historical redemptions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of miles not expected to be redeemed would have increased revenues by approximately $100 million.

Cargo Revenue

Cargo revenue is recognized when we provide the transportation.

72

Other Revenue

Other revenue includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, which is comprised principally of the marketing component of mileage sales to co-branded credit card and other partners and other marketing related payments. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed above in “Loyalty Revenue.” The remaining amounts included within other revenue relate to airport clubs, advertising and vacation-related services.

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment, as well as other fixed assets and finite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, tradenames and airport gate leasehold rights. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Finite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.

We assess impairment on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.

The majority of American’s aircraft fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.

Leases

We adopted ASU 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard) as of January 1, 2018. See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for further discussion about the New Lease Standard and its impact on our consolidated balance sheet. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, current operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current maturities of long-term debt and finance leases and long-term debt and finance leases, net of current maturities, in our consolidated balance sheet.

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term.

We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. We give consideration to our recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. A 100 basis point decrease in our estimate of the incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2018 (the date of our adoption of the New Lease Standard) would increase our operating lease liability by approximately $275 million.

Our lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.

Under certain of our capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers, we do not own the underlying aircraft. However, since we control the marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories of these aircraft and therefore control the asset, the aircraft is deemed to be leased for accounting purposes. For these capacity purchase agreements, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately. The lease component consists of the aircraft and the non-lease components consist of services, such as the crew and maintenance. We allocate the consideration in the capacity purchase agreements to the lease and non-lease components using their estimated relative standalone prices. See Note 12(b) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 10(b) to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on our capacity purchase agreements.

For real estate, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain domestic airport slots at our hubs and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.

In the second quarter of 2018, American recorded a $26 million impairment charge on a Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement. 

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors, among others, to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining per mile passenger yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.

Based upon our annual assessment, there were no impairments of our goodwill and no additional impairments of our indefinite-lived assets in 2018 other than the Brazil route authority described above.

Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits

We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1) discount rate, (2) expected return on plan assets, (3) expected health care cost trend rate and (4) estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2018, we reviewed and revised certain economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates, retirement rates and health care cost and trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in a decrease of $1.8 billion in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2018. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in a decrease of $126 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2018. We also revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans of $58 million and $1 million, respectively.

See Note 10 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Standards Adopted in 2018

Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the accounting pronouncements described below. 

ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (the New Revenue Standard)

The New Revenue Standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. We adopted the New Revenue Standard using the full retrospective method, which resulted in the recast of prior reporting periods. 

The adoption of the New Revenue Standard impacted our accounting for outstanding mileage credits earned through travel by AAdvantage loyalty program members. There was no change in accounting for sales of mileage credits to co-branded credit card or other partners. Prior to the adoption of the New Revenue Standard, we used the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our loyalty program liability related to mileage credits earned through travel, which were valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The New Revenue Standard required us to change our policy to the deferred revenue method and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The value of the earned mileage credits is materially greater under the deferred revenue method than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. 

The New Revenue Standard also required certain reclassifications, principally the reclassification of certain ancillary revenues previously classified and reported as other revenue to passenger revenue and as applicable to cargo revenue. Additionally, the New Revenue Standard required a gross presentation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations for certain revenues and expenses that had previously been presented on a net basis. 

See “Impacts to 2017 Results” and “Impacts to 2016 Results” below for the impact to our consolidated statements of operations data for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 related to the adoption of the New Revenue Standard. 

ASU 2017-07: Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (the New Retirement Standard)

The New Retirement Standard required all components of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, previously reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating income (expense). The New Retirement Standard was applied retrospectively, which resulted in the recast of each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of the New Retirement Standard had no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported.

See “Impacts to 2017 Results” and “Impacts to 2016 Results” below for the impact to our consolidated statements of operations data for 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the adoption of the New Retirement Standard.

ASU 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard)

The New Lease Standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (ROU) asset on the balance sheet for operating leases. Accounting for finance leases is substantially unchanged. The New Lease Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we elected to early adopt the New Lease Standard as of January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective transition, with the cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date (the effective date method). Under the effective date method, financial results reported in periods prior to 2018 are unchanged. We also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, does not require reassessment of lease classification.

The adoption of the New Lease Standard had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of approximately $10 billion of lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets for operating leases.

Additionally, we recognized a $197 million cumulative effect adjustment credit, net of tax, to retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings was driven principally by sale-leaseback transactions including the recognition of unamortized deferred aircraft sale-leaseback gains. Prior to the adoption of the New Lease Standard, gains on sale-leaseback transactions were generally deferred and recognized in the income statement over the lease term. Under the New Lease Standard, gains on sale-leaseback transactions (subject to adjustment for off-market terms) are recognized immediately. 

Finally, our 2018 pre-tax income decreased by $16 million as a result of adoption of the New Lease Standard. 

ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)

This ASU made several modifications to Subtopic 825-10, including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and it required equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard was adopted prospectively as of January 1, 2018 and resulted in a $60 million cumulative effect adjustment credit to retained earnings, net of tax, related to our investment in China Southern Airlines, which was previously accounted for under the cost method. 

ASU 2016-18: Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash

This ASU required that the change in the total cash balance, cash at the beginning of the period and cash at the end of the period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash, and also required companies that report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard was applied retrospectively, which resulted in the recast of prior reporting periods in the statement of cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, $11 million, $103 million and $113 million, respectively, of restricted cash is included in the total cash and restricted cash balance at the end of the period. A reconciliation of cash and restricted cash reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows to the amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheets is provided in a table below the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8A - AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Standards Effective for 2019 Reporting Periods

ASU 2018-02: Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

This ASU provides financial statement preparers with an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings due to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. The amount of the reclassification is the difference between the amount initially charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income at the previously enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and the amount that would have been charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income using the newly enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, excluding the effect of any valuation allowance previously charged to income from continuing operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard may impact tax amounts stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefit plans.
