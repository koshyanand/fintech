ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR-based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt, when appropriate, based on market conditions.

We had $4.0 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payable at December 31, 2018, and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $40.0 million in 2018 and $38.1 million in 2017 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturersâ€™ floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates.

We had $630.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2018, and $330.0 million at December 31, 2017. Based on the amounts outstanding, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to our annual interest expense of $6.3 million in 2018 and $3.3 million in 2017.

Our fixed rate long-term debt, consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and capital lease and other debt obligations, totaled $2.0 billion and had a fair value of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, and totaled $2.4 billion and had a fair value of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2017.
