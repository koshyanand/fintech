Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION  

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, provides management's views on our financial condition and results of operations, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, and includes the following sections:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

 We report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and also communicate with investors using certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we provide are useful to their assessments of our performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity.  

 Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period. By excluding the accounting effects, positive or negative, of certain items (e.g., restructuring charges, legal settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, gains or losses from curtailment or settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sales of certain assets, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information that facilitates an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing.  

 We use the following non-GAAP financial measures in this MD&A:   

Sales change ex. currency refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation and currency adjustment for transitional reporting of highly inflationary economies (Argentina). The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations. 

Organic sales change refers to sales change ex. currency, excluding the estimated impact of product line exits, acquisitions and divestitures, and, where applicable, the extra week in our fiscal year.   

 We believe that sales change ex. currency and organic sales change assist investors in evaluating the sales change from the ongoing activities of our businesses and enhance their ability to evaluate our results from period to period.    

Free cash flow refers to cash flow provided by operating activities, less payments for property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, plus (minus) net proceeds from sales (purchases) of investments and proceeds from insurance. Free cash flow is also adjusted for the cash contributions related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan. We believe that free cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions. 

Operational working capital as a percentage of annualized current quarter net sales refers to trade accounts receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable, and excludes cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, deferred taxes, other current assets and other current liabilities, as well as net current assets or liabilities held-for-sale divided by annualized current quarter net sales. We believe that operational working capital as a percentage of annualized current quarter net sales assists investors in assessing our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations attributable to our financing and other activities (which affect cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, other current assets, and other current liabilities) that tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing, and that may increase the volatility of working capital as a percentage of sales from period to period. The items excluded from this measure are not significantly influenced by our day-to-day activities managed at the operating level and do not necessarily reflect the underlying trends in our operations.   

  OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  

  Fiscal Year  

 Normally, our fiscal years consist of 52 weeks, but every fifth or sixth fiscal year consists of 53 weeks. Our 2018, 2017, and 2016 fiscal years consisted of 52-week periods ending December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Net Sales  

 The factors impacting the reported sales change are shown in the table below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In both years, net sales increased on an organic basis primarily due to higher volume.  

  Net Income  

 Net income increased from approximately $282 million in 2017 to approximately $467 million in 2018. The major factors affecting the change in net income in 2018 compared to 2017 were:  

 Positive factors:   

 Lower income taxes due to the combined effects of the 2017 tax charges related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") and a net tax benefit from a discrete foreign tax planning action 

 The combined effect of volume and mix 

 Benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs   

 Offsetting factors:   

 Pension plan settlement charges 

 Higher restructuring charges 

 Higher employee-related costs 

 Growth investments 

 Net impact of pricing and raw material inflation   

  U.S. Pension Plan Termination  

 In July 2018, our Board of Directors ("Board") approved the termination of the Avery Dennison Pension Plan (the "ADPP"), a U.S. defined benefit plan, effective as of September 28, 2018. In connection with the termination, we contributed $200 million to the ADPP in August 2018 using U.S. commercial paper borrowings. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we settled approximately $152 million of the ADPP liability through lump-sum payments from existing plan assets to eligible participants who elected to receive them and recorded approximately $85 million of non-cash charges associated with these settlements. We expect to settle the remaining liability of approximately $792 million through the purchase of group annuity contract(s) from one or more yet-to-be-identified highly rated insurance companies in the first half of 2019. Upon transfer of this remaining liability, we expect to recognize an additional $490 million of non-cash pre-tax charges and related tax benefits of $190 million. As of December 29, 2018, the ADPP was underfunded by approximately $57 million.  

  Cost Reduction Actions  

  2018/2019 Actions  

 In April 2018, we approved a restructuring plan (the "2018 Plan") associated with the consolidation of the European footprint of our Label and Graphic Materials ("LGM") reportable segment that is expected to result in a headcount reduction of approximately 400 positions related to the closure of a manufacturing facility. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by headcount additions in other locations, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 150 positions. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded $55.2 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, related to the 2018 Plan. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 345 positions to date, as well as asset impairment charges. The vast majority of the cash payments associated with these charges is expected to be made in 2019. We anticipate annualized savings from the 2018 Plan of approximately $25 million, beginning in the second half of 2019, and expect the 2018 Plan to be substantially complete by the end of 2019.  

 In addition to restructuring charges recorded under the 2018 Plan, we recorded $4.2 million in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter 2018 related to our 2018/2019 Actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 85 positions, as well as asset impairment charges.  

  2015/2016 Actions  

 During fiscal year 2018, we recorded $14.3 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, related to restructuring actions initiated during the third quarter of 2015. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 625 positions, lease cancellation costs, and asset impairment charges.  

 During fiscal year 2017, we recorded $34.1 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, related to our 2015/2016 Actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 920 positions, lease cancellation costs, and asset impairment charges.  

 The activities and related charges and payments for our 2015/2016 Actions were substantially completed in 2018.  

  Impact of Cost Reduction Actions  

 During fiscal year 2018, we realized approximately $30 million in savings, net of transition costs, primarily from our 2015/2016 Actions.  

 We anticipate incremental savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, of approximately $35 million in 2019, primarily related to our 2018/2019 Actions. We estimate cash restructuring costs of at least $20 million in 2019.  

 Restructuring charges were included in "Other expense, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 13, "Cost Reduction Actions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Acquisitions  

 During 2017, we completed the stock acquisitions of Yongle Tape Ltd. ("Yongle Tape") and Finesse Medical Limited, and the net asset acquisition of Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Limited and stock acquisition of certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "2017 Acquisitions"), which were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 In 2016, we completed the acquisition of the European business of Mactac ("Mactac"), which was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2, "Acquisitions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information  

  Accounting Guidance Updates  

 Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for this information.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Cash Flow  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to our $200 million contribution to the ADPP in connection with its termination, as well as higher income tax payments, net of refunds, changes in operational working capital, and higher incentive compensation payments, partially offset by higher net income. In 2018, free cash flow increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the ADPP contribution and higher net proceeds from insurance and sales of investments and proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.  

 In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher income before taxes, as well as lower pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher income tax payments, net of refunds. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 reflected the impact of our adoption of the accounting guidance update related to stock-based payments. Free cash flow increased due to higher net cash flow provided by operating activities, partially offset by higher net capital and software expenditures.  

  Outlook  

 Certain factors that we believe may contribute to our 2019 results are described below:   

 We expect our net sales, including the effects of foreign currency translation, to increase by approximately 1.5%.

 Assuming the continuation of foreign currency rates in effect at year-end 2018, currency translation will reduce our net sales by approximately 2.5% and our pre-tax operating income by approximately $25 million compared to 2018.

 We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the single-digit range.

 We anticipate capital and software expenditures of $275 million to $285 million.

 We estimate cash restructuring costs of at least $20 million.

 We estimate the net effect of non-cash charges and the tax impact related to the ADPP termination to reduce net income by approximately $300 million.   

  ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

  Income before Taxes  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Gross Profit Margin  

 Gross profit margin in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 reflecting the net impact of pricing and raw material inflation and higher employee-related costs, as well as growth investments, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring, net of transition costs.  

 Gross profit margin in 2017 decreased compared to 2016 due to margin decline in the Industrial and Healthcare Materials reportable segment driven by the impact of acquisitions, growth investments, operational challenges, and a program loss in personal care tapes, which began impacting results in mid-2016.  

  Marketing, General and Administrative Expense  

 Marketing, general and administrative expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting the impact of acquisitions and other growth investments and the negative impact of changes in foreign currency, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring, net of transition costs.  

 Marketing, general and administrative expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to acquisitions. Before the impact of acquisitions, the benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, were partially offset by higher employee-related costs.  

  Other Expense, net

  Interest Expense  

 Interest expense decreased approximately $4.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the repayment of senior notes in October 2017, which was financed by commercial paper borrowed at a lower interest rate.  

 Interest expense increased approximately $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to additional long-term debt borrowed in 2017.  

 We expect our interest expense in 2019 to be higher than in 2018 due to our issuance of $500 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2018.  

  Other Non-Operating Expense  

 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted an accounting guidance update that requires employers with defined benefit plans to present the components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost, outside of operating income. Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Other non-operating expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to settlement losses associated with the ADPP and two U.S. nonqualified benefit plans and two of our international benefit plans, partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets in certain of our international defined benefit pension plans.  

 Refer to Note 4, "Debt and Capital Leases," in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Net Income and Earnings per Share  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Provision for Income Taxes  

 The 2018 effective tax rate included measurement period adjustments to our 2017 provisional amount related to the TCJA in accordance with guidance provided under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"). In 2018, we adjusted our 2017 provisional amount by recognizing a net tax benefit of $34.7 million. This amount primarily reflected: (i) $39.6 million of tax benefit related to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax asset from cash contributions to the ADPP and realized foreign currency loss, both of which resulted from our decision to accelerate the related deductions on our 2017 U.S. federal income tax return; (ii) $3.6 million of tax charges for changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertions related to our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries after information required to make such determinations was obtained; (iii) $9.5 million of tax charge for adjustments made to the one-time transition tax, primarily due to a change in our filing position and to reflect regulatory and administrative guidance subsequently issued by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities; and (iv) $9.4 million of tax benefit from releasing a previously recorded uncertain tax position after the position was not taken on our 2017 U.S. federal income tax return.  

 The 2018 effective tax rate also included net tax charges related to: (i) the effects of certain U.S. international tax provisions imposed by the TCJA, including $16 million of tax charge on Global Intangible Low-taxed Income ("GILTI") and $9 million of tax charge on Base Erosion Antiabuse Tax ("BEAT"), partially offset by $2 million of tax benefit on Foreign Derived Intangible Income ("FDII"); (ii) $7.9 million of tax charges for foreign withholding taxes on our current year earnings; (iii) $8.8 million of tax benefit, including previously accrued interest and penalties, primarily from changes in our judgment about tax filing positions due to the effective settlement of our German tax audit for tax years 2006-2010; and (iv) $8 million of tax benefit from decreases in certain tax reserves, including interest and penalties, as a result of closing tax years.  

 During 2018, after our adoption of the accounting guidance update related to intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, certain foreign owned intellectual property was transferred between our foreign subsidiaries. Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Accordingly, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $31 million primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in a higher tax rate jurisdiction, partially offset by a taxable gain recognized in a lower tax rate jurisdiction.  

 The 2017 effective tax rate included: (i) $172 million of net tax charge related to the enactment of the TCJA; (ii) $5.1 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets; (iii) $4.2 million of tax benefit, including previously accrued interest and penalties, from effective settlements and changes in our judgment about tax filing positions as a result of new information; and (iv) $4.4 million of tax benefit from decreases in certain tax reserves, including interest and penalties, as a result of closing tax years.  

 The 2016 effective tax rate included: (i) $7.6 million of tax charge associated with the cost to repatriate current earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; (ii) $46.3 million of tax charge related to U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes resulting from changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions on certain foreign earnings and profits; (iii) $16.8 million of tax benefit resulting from settlements of certain foreign audits; (iv) $5.4 million of tax benefit resulting from expirations of statutes of limitations; (v) $6.7 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction associated with a structural simplification approved by the tax authority; (vi) $3.6 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances on certain state deferred tax assets; and (vii) $8.4 million of tax charge from deferred tax adjustments resulting from tax rate changes in certain foreign jurisdictions.

 The factors impacting reported sales change are shown in the table below.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In 2018, net sales increased on an organic basis primarily due to higher volume in industrial categories.  

 In 2017, net sales increased on an organic basis due to higher volume, as growth in industrial categories more than offset the anticipated decline in healthcare categories.  

  Operating Income  

 Operating income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by the net impact of acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by growth investments.  

 Operating income decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a program loss in personal care tapes, which began impacting results in mid-2016, higher employee-related costs, and growth investments, partially offset by volume growth in the industrial categories and the impact of acquisitions.  

  FINANCIAL CONDITION  

  Liquidity  

  Operating Activities  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 For cash flow purposes, changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments exclude the impact of foreign currency translation (discussed below in "Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts").  

 In 2018, cash flow provided by operating activities decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to our $200 million contribution to the ADPP in connection with its termination, higher income tax payments, net of refunds, changes in operational working capital, and higher incentive compensation payments, partially offset by higher net income.  

 In 2017, cash flow provided by operating activities increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher income before taxes, as well as lower pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher income tax payments, net of refunds. In addition, operating activities reflected the impact of our adoption of the accounting guidance update related to stock-based payments described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Investing Activities  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment  

 In 2018, we invested in equipment to support growth primarily in Asia, North America and Europe and to improve manufacturing productivity. In 2017 and 2016, we invested in new equipment to support growth in Asia, Europe and North America and to improve manufacturing productivity.  

  Purchases of Software and Other Deferred Charges  

 In 2018, we invested in information technology primarily associated with enterprise resource planning system implementations in North America and Asia. In 2017, we invested in information technology primarily associated with enterprise resource planning system implementations in North America, Asia, and Europe. Information technology investments in 2016 were primarily associated with standardization initiatives in Asia and North America.  

  Proceeds from Insurance and Sales (Purchases) of Investments, Net  

 In 2018, proceeds from insurance were associated with our corporate-owned life insurance policies. We also had higher proceeds from net sales of investments in 2018.  

  Payments for Acquisitions and Investments in Businesses  

 In 2018, we paid $3.8 million for investments in unconsolidated businesses. In 2017 and 2016, the aggregate payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and investments in businesses were approximately $319 million and $237 million, respectively, which we  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

funded through cash and commercial paper borrowings. The 2017 Acquisitions were also partially funded through proceeds from the senior notes we issued in 2017.  

 Refer to Note 2, "Acquisitions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Financing Activities  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Borrowings and Repayment of Debt  

 In December 2018, we issued $500 million of senior notes, due December 2028. The senior notes bear an interest rate of 4.875% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, were $493.3 million, which we used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Prior to the issuance of these senior notes, we used commercial paper borrowings in the third quarter to fund our $200 million contribution to the ADPP in connection with its termination.  

 In March 2017, we issued €500 million of senior notes, due March 2025. The senior notes bear an interest rate of 1.25% per year, payable annually in arrears. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, were $526.6 million (€495.5 million), a portion of which we used to repay commercial paper borrowed to finance a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of the European business of Mactac and the remainder of which we used for general corporate purposes, including other acquisitions.  

 In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to establish a Euro-Commercial Paper Program pursuant to which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500 million. Borrowings from this program were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of the European business of Mactac in 2016.  

 Given the seasonality of our cash flow from operating activities, during 2018, 2017, and 2016, our commercial paper borrowings were used to fund share repurchase activity, dividend payments, and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes.  

 Refer to Note 2, "Acquisitions," and Note 4, "Debt and Capital Leases," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Dividends Paid  

 We paid dividends of $2.01 per share in 2018 compared to $1.76 per share in 2017. In April 2018, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.52 per share, representing an increase of approximately 16% from our previous dividend rate of $.45 per share.  

  Share Repurchases  

 From time to time, our Board authorizes the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock. Repurchased shares may be reissued under our long-term incentive plan or used for other corporate purposes. In 2018, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $392.9 million. In 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $129.7 million.  

 In April 2017, our Board authorized the repurchase of additional shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $650 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such purchases, in addition to the amount outstanding under our previous Board authorization. Board authorizations remain in effect until shares in the amount authorized thereunder have been repurchased. As of December 29, 2018, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $232.4 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization.  

 Net (Tax Withholding) Proceeds Related to Stock-Based Compensation  

 In 2018, tax withholding for stock-based compensation increased compared to 2017 as a result of higher vesting-date share prices for equity awards vested during the year. In 2017, tax withholding for stock-based compensation, reflected the impact of our adoption of the accounting guidance update related to stock-based payments.  

 The number of stock options exercised was approximately .03 million, .6 million, and 1.4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Refer to Note 12, "Long-Term Incentive Compensation," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts  

  Long-lived Assets  

 Property, plant and equipment, net, increased by approximately $40 million to $1.1 billion at year-end 2018, which primarily reflected purchases of property, plant and equipment and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by depreciation expense.  

 Goodwill decreased by approximately $43 million to $941.8 million at year-end 2018 due to purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition of Yongle Tape and the impact of foreign currency translation.  

 Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions, net, decreased by approximately $22 million to $144 million at year-end 2018, which primarily reflected amortization expense.  

 Refer to Note 3, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

 Long-term retirement benefits and other liabilities decreased by approximately $295 million to $334.7 million, primarily reflecting our pension plan contribution and the reclassification of the remaining obligations to other current liabilities as a result of the termination of the ADPP, a reduction in contingent consideration liabilities, and lower net obligation for our international pension plans as a result of higher returns on plan assets and discount rates.  

  ​    ​    ​ 10     

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Shareholders' Equity Accounts  

 The balance of our shareholders' equity decreased by approximately $91 million to $955 million at year-end 2018, which reflected share repurchases, dividend payments and foreign currency translation, partially offset by current year net income, the net decrease in "accumulated other comprehensive loss," and the use of treasury shares to settle the exercise of stock options and vesting of stock-based awards, as well as to fund contributions to our U.S. defined contribution plan.  

 Refer to Note 6, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," and Note 11, "Supplemental Equity and Comprehensive Income Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Impact of Foreign Currency Translation  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 In 2018, international operations generated approximately 77% of our net sales. Our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.  

 The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to euro-denominated sales and sales in China, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on sales in Brazil and Turkey.  

 On July 1, 2018, we began accounting for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary, as the country's three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As a result, the functional currency of our Argentine subsidiary became the U.S. dollar.  

  Effect of Foreign Currency Transactions  

 The impact on net income from transactions denominated in foreign currencies is largely mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income and cash flow exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts where available and appropriate. We also utilize certain foreign-currency-denominated debt to mitigate our foreign currency translation exposure from our net investment in foreign operations.  

  Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios  

 We utilize the financial ratios discussed below to assess our financial condition and operating performance.  

  Operational Working Capital Ratio  

 Operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, is reconciled to working capital below. Our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, to maximize our cash flow and return on investment. Operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales in 2018 was comparable to 2017.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Accounts Receivable Ratio  

 The average number of days sales outstanding was 62 days in 2018 compared to 63 days in 2017, calculated using the four-quarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the average daily sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the average number of days sales outstanding primarily reflected the impact of foreign currency translation.  

  Inventory Ratio  

 Average inventory turnover was 7.8 in 2018 compared to 7.9 in 2017, calculated using the annual cost of sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and divided by the four-quarter average inventory balance. The decrease in the average inventory turnover primarily reflected the timing of inventory purchases.  

  Accounts Payable Ratio  

 The average number of days payable outstanding was 73 days in 2018 compared to 72 days in 2017, calculated using the four-quarter average accounts payable balance divided by the average daily cost of products sold in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in average number of days payable outstanding primarily reflected the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by the impact of the 2017 Acquisitions and foreign currency translation.  

  Financial Covenants  

 Our revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain specified ratios of total debt and interest expense in relation to certain measures of income. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, we were in compliance with our financial covenants.  

  Fair Value of Debt  

 The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is primarily based on the credit spread above U.S. Treasury securities on notes with similar rates, credit rating, and remaining maturities. The fair value of short-term borrowings, which includes commercial paper issuances and short-term lines of credit, approximates carrying value given the short duration of these obligations. The increase in the fair value of our total debt from $1.6 billion at December 30, 2017 to $2 billion at  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

December 29, 2018 primarily reflected our issuance of $500 million of senior notes in 2018. Fair value amounts were determined based primarily on Level 2 inputs, which are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable. Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Capital Resources  

 Capital resources include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and debt financing, including ready access to commercial paper. We plan to use these resources to fund operational needs, including payments related to the ADPP termination and cost reduction actions.  

 At year-end 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $232 million held in accounts at third-party financial institutions. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At year-end 2018, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.  

 To meet U.S. cash requirements, we have several cost-effective liquidity options available. These options include borrowing funds at reasonable rates, including borrowings from foreign subsidiaries, and repatriating foreign earnings and profits. However, if we were to repatriate incremental foreign earnings and profits, we may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by foreign tax authorities and additional U.S. taxes due to the impact of foreign currency movements related to such earnings and profits.  

 In November 2017, we amended and restated the Revolver, increasing the amount available from certain domestic and foreign banks from $700 million to $800 million. The amendment also extended the Revolver's maturity date to November 8, 2022. The maturity date may be extended for additional one-year periods under certain circumstances. The commitments under the Revolver may be increased by up to $300 million, subject to lender approvals and customary requirements. The Revolver is used as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program and can be used for other corporate purposes.  

 No balances were outstanding under the Revolver as of year-end 2018 or 2017. Commitment fees associated with the Revolver in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $1.2 million, $1.1 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.  

 In addition to the Revolver, we have significant short-term lines of credit available in various countries totaling approximately $330 million at December 29, 2018. These lines may be cancelled at any time by us or the issuing banks. Short-term borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit were $45.5 million and $76.1 million at December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, with a weighted-average interest rate of 7% and 6.2%, respectively.  

 In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to establish a Euro-Commercial Paper Program pursuant to which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500 million. Proceeds from issuances under this program may be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issuance. Our payment obligations with respect to any notes issued under this program are backed by the Revolver. There are no financial covenants under this program. As of December 29, 2018, no balance was outstanding under this program.  

 We had $131 million and $183.8 million of U.S. commercial paper borrowings outstanding at year-end 2018 and 2017, respectively, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.75% and 1.79%, respectively.  

 We had medium-term notes of $45 million outstanding at year-end 2018 and 2017.  

 Refer to Note 4, "Debt and Capital Leases," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

 We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates, and to possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.  

  Capital from Debt  

 Our total debt increased by approximately $385 million to $1.97 billion at year-end 2018 compared to $1.58 billion at year-end 2017, primarily reflecting our issuance of $500 million of senior notes, a portion of which we used to repay commercial paper borrowings.  

 Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short- and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid and our access to commercial paper, credit facilities, and other borrowings. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited, the Revolver and our other credit facilities would be available to meet our short-term funding requirements, if necessary. When determining a credit rating, we believe that rating agencies primarily consider our competitive position, business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade rating.

 We enter into operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space and equipment for information technology, machinery, and transportation. The table above includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms of one year or more.  

 The table above does not include:   

 Purchase obligations or open purchase orders at year-end  It is impracticable for us to obtain this information or provide a reasonable estimate thereof due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems. In addition, purchase orders are generally entered into at fair value and cancelable without penalty. 

 Cash funding requirements for pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees under our funded plans  Benefits under our funded pension plans are paid through trusts or trust equivalents. Cash funding requirements for our funded plans, which can be significantly impacted by earnings on investments, the discount rate, changes in the plans, and funding laws and regulations, are not included as we are not able to estimate required contributions to the trusts or trust equivalents. Refer to Note 6, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding expected contributions to these plans and plan terminations and settlements. 

 Pension and postretirement benefit payments  As of December 29, 2018, we had unfunded benefit obligations from certain defined benefit plans. Refer to Note 6, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information, including expected benefit payments over the next 10 years. 

 Deferred compensation plan benefit payments  It is impracticable for us to obtain a reasonable estimate for 2019 and beyond due to the volatility of the payment amounts and certain events that could trigger immediate payment of benefits to participants. In addition, participant account balances are marked-to-market monthly and benefit payments are adjusted annually. Refer to Note 6, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

 Cash awards to employees under incentive compensation plans  The amounts to be paid to employees under these awards are based on our stock price and, if applicable, achievement of certain performance objectives as of the end of their respective performance periods, and, therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the amounts to be paid on the vesting dates. Refer to Note 12, "Long-term Incentive Compensation," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

 Unfunded termination indemnity benefits to certain employees outside of the U.S.  These benefits are subject to applicable agreements, local laws and regulations. We have not incurred significant costs related to these arrangements. 

 Unrecognized tax benefits of $80.8 million  The resolution of the balance, including the timing of payments, is contingent upon various unknown factors and cannot be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 14, "Taxes Based on Income," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

 Payments related to cost reduction actions  The payments for severance and other contract terminations are subject to applicable agreements, local laws and practices. Refer to Note 13, "Cost Reduction Actions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.   

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

 Critical accounting estimates are those that are important to our financial condition and results, and which require us to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Critical accounting estimates cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because their future resolution is unknown. We believe our critical accounting estimates include accounting for goodwill, pension and postretirement benefits, taxes based on income, and long-term incentive compensation.  

  Goodwill  

 Our reporting units are composed of either a discrete business or an aggregation of businesses with similar economic characteristics. In performing the required impairment tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors before performing a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. A quantitative assessment primarily consists of a present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill. For certain reporting units the goodwill of which is acquired in the current period, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter.  

 Certain factors may result in the need to perform an impairment test prior to the fourth quarter, including significant underperformance of a business relative to expected operating results, significant adverse economic and industry trends, significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value, or a decision to divest a portion of a reporting unit.  

 We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.  

 In consultation with outside specialists, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions about the reporting units, including sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Assumptions about discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital for comparable companies. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, and growth rates are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

long-term business plan period. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. However, actual future results may materially differ from these estimates and projections. The valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of reporting units requires inputs and assumptions that reflect current market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies that require management judgment. The estimated fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions.  

 In our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2018, the goodwill of reporting units in our Label and Graphic Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions reportable segments were tested utilizing a qualitative assessment. Based on this assessment we determined that the fair values of the reporting units in both reportable segments were greater than their carrying values. Therefore, the goodwill in these reporting units was not impaired.  

 Additionally, in our annual impairment analysis, the goodwill of reporting units in our Industrial and Healthcare Materials reportable segment were tested utilizing a quantitative assessment. This assessment indicated that the fair values of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, including goodwill. Except for our Yongle Tape reporting unit acquired in 2017, the fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 100% or more. Yongle Tape's fair value exceeded its carrying value by 22%, assuming a discount rate of 12% and a perpetual growth rate of 3.5%. As of December 29, 2018, the carrying value of Yongle Tape's goodwill was $81.7 million.  

  Pension and Postretirement Benefits  

 Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changes in market conditions or participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs.  

  Discount Rate  

 In consultation with our actuaries, we annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in valuing our postretirement obligations. With the exception of the ADPP, the assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. Our discount rate is determined by evaluating yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans. As of December 29, 2018, the discount rate for the ADPP after reflecting plan termination was set based on estimated insurer pricing. As of December 29, 2018, a .25% increase in the discount rate in the U.S. would have decreased our year-end projected benefit obligation by approximately $23 million and increased expected periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $.04 million. Conversely, a .25% decrease in the discount rate in the U.S. would have increased our year-end projected benefit obligation by approximately $24 million and decreased expected periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $.1 million. As of December 29, 2018, a .25% increase in the discount rate associated with our international plans would have decreased our year-end projected benefit obligation by $34 million and increased expected periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $2 million. Conversely, a .25% decrease in the discount rate associated with our international plans would have increased our year-end projected benefit obligation by approximately $37 million and decreased expected periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $2 million.  

 We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under this approach, we applied multiple discount rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest cost by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding rates on the yield curve.  

  Long-term Return on Assets  

 We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into account our asset allocation, the correlation between returns in our asset classes, and our mix of active and passive investments. Additionally, current market conditions, including interest rates, are evaluated and market data is reviewed for reasonableness and appropriateness. An increase or decrease of .25% on the long-term return on assets in the U.S. would have decreased or increased, respectively, our periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $.5 million. An increase or decrease of .25% on the long-term return on assets associated with our international plans would have decreased or increased, respectively, our periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $2 million.  

  Taxes Based on Income  

 Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. These assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. These amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. Our assessment of these sources of income relies heavily on estimates. Our forecasted earnings by jurisdiction are determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to our operations may affect our effective tax rate. For example, our future income tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions in which we have significant deferred tax assets that are dependent on such earnings to be realized. We use historical experience along with operating forecasts to evaluate expected future taxable income. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

valuation allowance is established in the period we make such a determination. A tax planning strategy is defined as "an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets."  

 Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the different tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we do business. For example, the TCJA had a significant impact on our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017.  

 We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.  

 Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and governmental taxing authorities. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant facts and circumstances existing at the balance sheet date, taking into consideration existing laws, regulations and practices of any governmental authorities exercising jurisdiction over our operations. For example, the European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. We continue to monitor state aid developments since they involve jurisdictions in which we have significant operations, and consider these matters in determining our uncertain tax positions.  

 Our income tax provision for fiscal year 2018 included measurement period adjustments to our 2017 provisional amount related to the TCJA in accordance with guidance provided under SAB 118. We completed our analysis based on our interpretation of available U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative interpretations. However, the provisions of the TCJA are subject to further amendments, interpretations, regulations, and court cases, any of which could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation.  

 Refer to Note 14, "Taxes Based on Income," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  Long-Term Incentive Compensation  

 We have not capitalized expense associated with our long-term incentive compensation.  

 Changes in estimated forfeiture rates are recorded as cumulative adjustments in the period estimates are revised.  

  Valuation of Stock-Based Awards  

 Our stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and performance units ("PUs"). The compensation expense related to market-leveraged stock units ("MSUs") is based on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and amortized on a graded-vesting basis over their respective performance periods.  

 Compensation expense for awards with a market condition as a performance objective, which includes PUs and MSUs, is not adjusted if the condition is not met, as long as the requisite service period is met.  

 The fair value of stock options is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and the expected option term.  

 The following assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of granted stock options:  

 Risk-free interest rate is based on the 52-week average of the Treasury-Bond rate that has a term corresponding to the expected option term.  

 Expected stock price volatility represents an average of implied and historical volatility.  

 Expected dividend yield is based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12-month average of our monthly stock price prior to the date of grant.  

 Expected option term is determined based on historical experience under our stock option and incentive plans.  

 The fair value of RSUs and the component of PUs that is subject to achievement of performance objectives based on a financial performance condition is determined based on the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for foregone dividends.  

 The fair value of stock-based awards that are subject to achievement of performance objectives based on a market condition, which includes MSUs and the other component of PUs, is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables, including expected stock price volatility and other assumptions appropriate for determining fair value, to estimate the probability of satisfying the target performance objectives established for the award.  

 Certain of these assumptions are based on management's estimates, in consultation with outside specialists. Significant changes in assumptions for future awards and actual forfeiture rates could materially impact stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.  

  Valuation of Cash-Based Awards  

 Cash-based awards consist of long-term incentive units ("LTI Units") granted to eligible employees. LTI Units are classified as liability awards and remeasured at each quarter-end over the applicable vesting or performance period. In addition to LTI Units with terms and conditions that mirror those of RSUs, we also grant certain employees LTI Units with terms and conditions that mirror those of PUs and MSUs.

  MARKET-SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  

  Risk Management  

 We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  

 We generally do not purchase or hold foreign currency or interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not hedge our foreign currency translation exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net income. We also utilize certain foreign-currency-denominated debt to mitigate our foreign currency translation exposure from our net investment in foreign operations.  

 Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  

 Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with natural gas anticipated to be used in manufacturing and operations. These amounts are not material to our financial statements.  

 In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks that are either non-financial or non-quantifiable. These risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions, other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price risk and litigation and compliance risk, which are not reflected in the analyses that follow.  

  Foreign Exchange Value-At-Risk  

 We use a Value-At-Risk ("VAR") model to determine the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in earnings associated with our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions. The model includes foreign exchange derivative contracts. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.  

 In both 2018 and 2017, the VAR was estimated using a variance-covariance methodology. The currency correlation was based on one-year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a one-day time horizon.  

 The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was $.5 million at year-end 2018 and $1.1 million at year-end 2017.  

 The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not represent actual losses in fair value that we could incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.  

  Interest Rate Sensitivity  

 In 2018, an assumed 30 basis point move in interest rates affecting our variable-rate borrowings (10% of our weighted-average interest rate on floating rate debt) would have increased interest expense by approximately $1.3 million.  

 In 2017, an assumed 30 basis point move in interest rates affecting our variable-rate borrowings (10% of our weighted-average interest rate on floating rate debt) would have increased interest expense by approximately $.7 million.
