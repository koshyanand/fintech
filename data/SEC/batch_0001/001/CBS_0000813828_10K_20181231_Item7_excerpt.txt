Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Overview

Business Overview and Strategy

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, direct-to-consumer digital streaming services and other internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate affiliate and subscription fee, licensing and advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company plans to increase its investment in premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company’s content on its direct-to-consumer digital streaming services; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), third-party live television digital streaming offerings (“virtual MVPDs”), and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits. The Company’s continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide incremental revenues across all of the Company’s main revenue streams.

Corporate Matters

In August 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of allegations in recent press reports about the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of the Company. In September 2018, Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, pursuant to a separation and settlement agreement and releases, and the Company appointed its then Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Joseph R. Ianniello, as President and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board is conducting a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Ianniello is a candidate in this search. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced the completion of the investigation and certain findings of the investigation. Also during 2018, the Company was involved in legal proceedings with its controlling shareholder, National Amusements, Inc., among others, which concluded with the dismissal of all claims pursuant to a settlement and release agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, on September 9, 2018, seven members of the Board resigned and the Board appointed six new members to the Board. On September 23, 2018, two directors who had served as members of the Board prior to September 9, 2018 resigned to pursue other interests, and, on October 21, 2018, another director resigned for health-related reasons. In addition, in early 2018, a potential combination with Viacom Inc. was evaluated by a special committee established by the Board. The uncertainties arising from leadership changes at the Company may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. In connection with the aforementioned matters, the Company incurred expenses of $128 million in 2018. See “Legal Matters” for certain related information.

(a) See pages II-8, II-9, II-35 and II-36 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For 2018, revenues reached an all-time high of $14.51 billion, an increase of 6% from 2017, driven by growth across each of the Company’s main revenue streams. Advertising revenues grew 8%, driven by record political advertising sales from the 2018 midterm elections and the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship (“NCAA Tournament”) and five Thursday Night Football games, which were broadcast by the CBS Television Network in 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced strong demand for CBS Television Network advertising. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues in 2018 were comparable with 2017, as higher pricing and higher ratings for Sunday National Football League (“NFL”) games were offset by lower ratings for the Company’s primetime programming. Affiliate and subscription fees increased 7%, driven by 62% growth from the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services, CBS All Access and Showtime, and higher station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, including from virtual MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in 2017, which reduced the affiliate and subscription fee comparison by eight percentage points. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up 3%, mainly from higher international licensing and the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in 2018. This new standard resulted in revenues from the distribution of third-party content now being recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to participation expenses (see “Adoption of New Revenue Standard”). These increases were partially offset by lower domestic licensing compared with 2017. 

II-5

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating income decreased 3% from 2017. This comparison was impacted by several discrete items, including restructuring charges, costs relating to corporate matters and programming charges resulting from changes in the Company’s programming strategy, primarily at CBS Films. Adjusted operating income increased 5%, primarily reflecting the revenue growth, which was partially offset by an increased investment in content, including a higher number of premium series produced for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services, as well as for distribution on other platforms. Net earnings for 2018 were $1.96 billion, or $5.14 per diluted share, compared with $357 million, or $.88 per diluted share, for 2017. The net earnings comparison was impacted by the following discrete items: the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2018, charges in 2017 resulting from a pension settlement and the enactment of federal tax legislation in December 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”); and, in discontinued operations for 2017, a net loss from the split-off of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio”) and a noncash charge to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio. (See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.) Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) increased 18% to $5.19 for 2018, driven by the higher adjusted operating income and a lower effective income tax rate in 2018, which resulted from the Tax Reform Act, as well as lower weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See pages II-8 and II-9 for details of the discrete items excluded from financial results, and reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 

The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.43 billion in 2018 compared with $793 million in 2017, which included discretionary pension contributions of $600 million to prefund the Company’s qualified pension plans. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.26 billion for 2018 compared with $989 million for 2017. These increases primarily reflected lower cash payments for income taxes and growth in affiliate and subscription fees, which were partially offset by the aforementioned increased investment in content. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow” on pages II-35 and II-36 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted free cash flow.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Adoption of New Revenue Standard

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 606 (“ASC 606”) on the recognition of revenues which primarily resulted in two changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies. 

•Revenues from Distribution Arrangements

Revenues from the Company’s distribution of third-party content are now recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues, which include content licensing and distribution revenues and advertising revenues, were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues and operating expenses relating to such distribution arrangements were each $279 million higher under ASC 606 than the amounts that would have been reported under previous accounting guidance, with no impact to operating income. 

•Revenues from the Renewal of Licensing Agreements

Revenues associated with the renewal of an existing license agreement are now recognized at the beginning of the renewal period. Under previous accounting guidance, these revenues were recognized upon the execution of such renewal. Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons will continue to be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of when Company-owned television series are made available for multiyear licensing agreements. Therefore, this change is not expected to have a material impact on the trend of the Company’s financial results. Additionally, historically, on an annual basis, revenues from renewals executed each year have approximated revenues associated with renewal periods that began in the same year. 

The Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and therefore, prior periods continue to be presented under previous accounting guidance. The following table presents the Company’s revenues, operating income, net earnings from continuing operations, and diluted EPS from continuing operations, as well as the corresponding year-over-year comparisons, as if results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were recognized under ASC 606. These amounts are non-GAAP financial measures and are reconciled below to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that presenting its financial results for 2017 under ASC 606 is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results for 2017 on a basis consistent with the 2018 presentation, and makes it easier to compare the Company’s year-over-year results. If revenues were recognized under ASC 606 for 2017, the year-over-year comparisons to 2018 for operating income, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations would have been similar to the comparisons on a reported basis.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

Results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included discrete items that were not part of the normal course of operations. The following tables present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of these discrete items, reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company.

Revenues

II-9

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Advertising

For 2018, the 8% increase in advertising revenues was driven by the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and record political advertising sales in 2018 associated with the U.S. midterm elections. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues for 2018 were comparable with 2017, as higher pricing and higher ratings for Sunday NFL games were offset by lower ratings for the Company’s primetime programming.

Advertising revenues for 2018 also benefited from higher revenues from the distribution of third-party content, resulting from such revenues now being recognized at the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses, as a result of the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard (see “Adoption of New Revenue Standard”). Under previous guidance such distribution revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the broadcast of five Thursday Night Football games and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. The National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast by the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”). 

In 2019, advertising revenues will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through 2022 under the current contract with the NFL, and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament. However, the advertising revenue comparison in 2019 will be negatively affected by the benefit in 2018 from record political advertising sales. The CBS Television Network’s upfront advertising sales (“Upfront”) for the 2018/2019 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2018 through the middle of September 2019, resulted in pricing and volume increases compared with the prior broadcast season, which are expected to benefit the Company’s advertising revenues during the 2018/2019 broadcast season. (See page I-2 for a description of the Upfront market.) However, overall advertising revenues for the Company will be dependent on ratings for its programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market, in which advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming.

Content Licensing and Distribution

Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally-produced television programming; fees from the distribution of third-party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For 2018, content licensing and distribution revenues increased 3%, benefiting from higher revenues from the distribution of third-party content, resulting from such revenues now being recognized at the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to participation expense, as a result of the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard (see “Adoption of New Revenue Standard”). Under previous guidance such distribution revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. Content licensing and distribution revenues also reflected growth in international licensing, offset by lower domestic licensing, mainly resulting from several large sales in 2017, including NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and titles from the CSI franchise.

Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of Company-owned television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. Unrecognized revenues attributable to signed license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $1.08 billion at December 31, 2018 and $670 million at December 31, 2017, 

II-10

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

which increased to $1.33 billion on January 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 800 episodes of scripted original programming that had not yet been made available in the secondary domestic marketplace (See page II-59 for a description of the secondary marketplace).

Total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements were $3.57 billion at December 31, 2018, $4.06 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.45 billion at January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.96 billion in 2019, $771 million in 2020, $430 million in 2021, $236 million in 2022, and $181 million in 2023 and thereafter. 

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs and virtual MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), as well as fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and virtual MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); subscription fees for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services; and revenues received for the distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. For 2018, the 7% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects 22% growth in station affiliation and retransmission fees and 62% growth from the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services, CBS All Access and Showtime. These increases were partially offset by Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in 2017, which reduced the comparison by eight percentage points.

Over the next two years, agreements with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, representing approximately 85% of the Company’s total subscribers to these services, and agreements with station affiliates representing approximately 60% of the Company’s total subscribers under its station affiliation agreements, will come up for renewal. Historically, renewals of these agreements have resulted in increases in the rates received by the Company and therefore, the Company expects to benefit from these renewals over the next few years. In addition, the Company’s existing agreements with station affiliates, MVPDs and virtual MVPDs include annual contractual increases. Together, these factors are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees over the next several years.

Other 

Other revenues are principally comprised of revenues from the rental of production facilities and ancillary digital revenues. 

International Revenues

For 2018, international revenues increased 26% primarily driven by the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company generated approximately 17% and 15% of its total revenues from international regions in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired programs exhibited on television broadcast and cable networks, and television stations. For 2018, the 9% decrease in programming expenses was primarily driven by lower sports programming costs, resulting from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in 2017 and the absence of Thursday Night Football and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by costs for programming on Network 10, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Production

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally-developed television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2018, the 18% increase in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a 17% increase in the number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, and the acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with recent management changes, the Company implemented changes to its programming strategy, primarily at CBS Films, which will shift its focus from theatrical films to developing content for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services. As a result, the Company recorded programming charges of $85 million in 2018.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television content, such as print and advertising. For 2018, the 30% increase in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, which resulted in revenues from the Company’s distribution of third-party content now being recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. This change resulted in an increase to both revenues and participation expenses of $279 million for 2018, with no impact to the Company’s operating income. 

Other

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For 2018, the 9% increase in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth in the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services and expenses of Network 10, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support. The 4% increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflected the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and higher advertising and marketing costs associated with an increased number of original programs, including for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services. 

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters

During the year ended December 31, 2018, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization and closure of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $67 million, reflecting $57 million of severance costs and $10 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. These restructuring activities are expected to reduce the Company’s annual cost structure by approximately $70 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $63 million, reflecting $54 million of severance costs and $9 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $30 million, reflecting $19 million of severance costs and $11 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. 

As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative settlements for the 2018, 2017, and 2016 restructuring charges were $88 million, of which $74 million was for severance costs and $14 million related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2018, the Company recorded expenses of $128 million primarily for professional fees related to legal proceedings, recent investigations at the Company (see “Legal Matters”) and the evaluation of a potential combination with Viacom Inc.

In February 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan under which severance payments will be provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elect to participate. As a result, the Company expects to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2019. The amount of this charge and the associated future savings will be based on the number of eligible employees who elect to participate in the restructuring plan and therefore cannot currently be determined.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For 2017, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $49 million reflected a pretax loss associated with the Company’s redemption of $800 million of its long-term debt.

Pension Settlement Charges

During 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation

was reduced by approximately $800 million, which represented approximately 20% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $352 million in 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling $600 million to prefund its qualified pension plans.

Other Items, Net

The following table presents the components of Other items, net.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The lower tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflects a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Reform Act. 

(b) During the third quarter of 2018, in connection with the preparation of its 2017 federal tax return, the Company elected to utilize a federal tax law provision that was retroactively renewed in 2018. This tax law provision allowed the Company to immediately expense certain qualified production costs on its 2017 tax return. As a result, during the third quarter of 2018, the Company established a deferred tax liability associated with this deduction at the 2017 federal tax rate of 35%, and concurrently recorded a net tax benefit of $69 million, primarily reflecting the re-measurement of this deferred tax liability at the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21% under the Tax Reform Act. This benefit was partially offset by a charge of $15 million to adjust the provisional amount of transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits that resulted from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.) 2017 reflects the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. As a result of this tax law, the Company recorded a net provisional charge of $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an estimated tax impact of $407 million on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by an estimated benefit of $278 million to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 

(c) Reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance relating to capital loss carryforwards that will be utilized in connection with the sale of CBS Television City in the first quarter of 2019.

(d) Reflects the difference between the tax benefit from stock-based compensation expense and the deduction on the tax return associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. This difference occurs because stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on the grant-date fair value of the award, whereas the tax deduction is based on the fair value on the date the stock option is exercised or the RSU vests. 

II-15

For 2019, the Company’s annual effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% before any potential discrete items, including the tax impacts from stock-based compensation. 

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax

The following table presents equity in earnings (loss) of investee companies for the Company’s domestic and international equity investments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2018, the increase in net earnings from continuing operations of 50% was primarily driven by the lower effective income tax rate in 2018 and a pension settlement charge of $352 million ($237 million, net of tax) in 2017. Diluted EPS from continuing operations grew 60% reflecting higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding. 

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

On November 16, 2017, the Company completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted 17.9 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 101.4 million shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

The following table sets forth details of net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, the Company recorded a market value adjustment of $980 million in 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom. 

(b) Reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation.

(c) Reflects adjustments to the loss on disposal of the Company’s outdoor advertising businesses, primarily from a decrease to the guarantee liability associated with the 2013 disposal of the Company’s outdoor advertising business in Europe.

For 2017, the 9% decrease in advertising revenues primarily reflects the benefit to 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks. The decline also reflects the benefit in 2016 from political advertising sales during the 2016 Presidential election cycle. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues declined 2% in 2017, mainly as a result of lower ratings for the Company’s programming, which was partially offset by higher pricing. 

Content Licensing and Distribution

For 2017, the 8% increase in content licensing and distribution revenues reflected growth in both international and domestic licensing sales. The increase in domestic licensing sales was primarily driven by sales of NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and several titles from the CSI franchise. Internationally, the Company benefited from strong demand for its content during 2017, reflecting additional titles available for sale as a result of the Company’s increased investment in internally-produced series.

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

For 2017, the 26% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects revenues from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event, which contributed nine points of the growth. Underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenues increased 17%, led by 27% growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, and 98% growth from digital initiatives, including the Company’s owned streaming subscription services, CBS All Access and the Showtime direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription offering, and virtual MVPDs. 

International Revenues

For 2017, international revenues increased 9% primarily as a result of higher television licensing sales. The Company generated approximately 15% and 14% of its total revenues from international regions in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming

For 2017, the 7% increase in programming expenses was driven by costs associated with Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event; CBS’s broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, and an increased investment in cable programming. Costs in 2016 associated with CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50 partially offset these increases. 

Production

For 2017, the 8% increase in production expenses reflected an increased investment in internally-developed television series and higher costs associated with the increase in television licensing revenues. 

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

For 2017, the 1% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the mix of titles sold under television licensing arrangements.

Other

For 2017, the 5% increase in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher compensation costs associated with the Company’s growth initiatives and increased costs resulting from a higher volume of book sales.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2017, the 4% increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflected higher advertising and marketing costs, mainly to support the Company’s growth initiatives.

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $63 million, reflecting $54 million of severance costs and $9 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $30 million, reflecting $19 million of severance costs and $11 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. 

In 2016, the Company incurred professional fees of $8 million associated with merger and acquisition-related activities. 

Other Operating Items, Net

For 2017, other operating items, net reflected a net gain relating to the disposition of property and equipment. For 2016, other operating items, net included a gain from the disposition of an internet business in China and a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For 2017, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $49 million reflected a pretax loss associated with the Company’s redemption of $800 million of its long-term debt.

Pension Settlement Charges

During 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately $800 million, which represented approximately 20% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $352 million in 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling $600 million to prefund its qualified pension plans.

During 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company paid a total of $518 million of lump-sum distributions in 2016 using its pension plan assets, which represented 12% of the total obligations of its qualified pension plans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $211 million reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Reflects the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. As a result of this tax law, the Company recorded a net provisional charge of $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an estimated tax impact of $407 million on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by an estimated benefit of $278 million to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 

(b) Reflects excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted FASB guidance which requires that the difference between the tax benefit from stock-based compensation expense and the deduction on the tax return be recognized within the income tax provision on the statement of operations. Previously, such difference was recognized in stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. This difference occurs because stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the grant-date fair value of the award, whereas the tax deduction is based on the fair value on the date the stock option is exercised or the RSU vests. This guidance requires the income statement classification to be applied prospectively, and therefore, excess tax benefits for prior periods remain classified in stockholders’ equity.

(c) For the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflects tax benefits from the resolution of certain state income tax matters. For the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflects a one-time tax benefit of $47 million associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016.

For 2016, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax included $10 million for the write-down of an international television joint venture to its fair value.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2017, the decreases in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations of 16% and 7%, respectively, were driven by pension settlement charges of $352 million ($237 million, net of tax) in 2017 compared with $211 million ($130 million, net of tax) in 2016; a provisional charge of $129 million from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017; and a charge of $49 million ($31 million, net of tax) from the early extinguishment of debt. Diluted EPS from continuing operations benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s share repurchases and the shares retired as a result of the split-off of CBS Radio during the fourth quarter of 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, the Company recorded a market value adjustment of $980 million in 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom. 

(b) Reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation.

(c) Reflects adjustments to the loss on disposal of the Company’s outdoor advertising businesses, primarily from a decrease to the guarantee liability associated with the 2013 disposal of the Company’s outdoor advertising business in Europe.

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster’s consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Atria Books. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 6% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, and 5% to total segment operating income in each of the years 2018 and 2017 and 4% to total segment operating income in 2016.

LOCAL MEDIA: The Local Media segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Local Digital Media, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales and retransmission fees. The Local Media segment contributed 13%, 12%, and 14% to consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and 20%, 17%, and 21% to total segment operating income in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began presenting CBS Sports Network in the Entertainment segment, to reflect changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. CBS Sports Network was previously included in the Cable Networks segment. Results for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and other operating items, net, each where applicable (“Segment Operating Income”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to the Company’s consolidated net earnings is presented in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

n/m - not meaningful

For 2018, the 9% increase in revenues mainly reflected 29% growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, primarily as a result of higher station affiliation fees and growth from the Company’s direct-to-consumer streaming service, CBS All Access. Also contributing to the increase was 7% growth in advertising revenues driven by the acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by the absence of Thursday Night Football and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues for 2018 were comparable with the prior year. Entertainment revenues also benefited from the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in 2018, which resulted in higher revenues from distribution arrangements, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses. (See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.) Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 3%, primarily reflecting this new standard and higher international licensing, partially offset by lower

domestic licensing, mainly as a result of several large sales in 2017 including NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and titles from the CSI franchise.

Operating income increased 6% as a result of higher revenues and lower programming costs associated with the absence of CBS’s broadcast of Thursday Night Football, partially offset by an increased investment in content and digital initiatives. For 2018 and 2017, restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

Results in 2019 will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through 2022 under the current contract, and the broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreement with the NCAA and Turner. Results are also expected to benefit from continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, driven by the renewal of several of the Company’s agreements with MVPDs and its television station affiliates, as well as annual contractual increases on multiyear agreements. Revenue comparisons will also be affected by fluctuations resulting from the timing of multiyear licensing agreements for television series. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. In addition, the Company plans to increase its investment in content in 2019, including increasing the number of series on CBS All Access in order to drive long-term subscriber growth. This will increase costs for the Entertainment segment in 2019 compared with 2018. 

Cable Networks (Showtime Networks and Smithsonian Networks)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2018, the 6% decrease in revenues was driven by Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in 2017, which impacted the comparison by 12 percentage points. Underlying results reflected growth from the Showtime direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription offering and higher licensing sales of Showtime original series. As of December 31, 2018, subscriptions totaled approximately 27 million for Showtime, including its direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription offering, and 32 million for Smithsonian Networks.

Operating income decreased 8% driven by an increased investment in programming, partially offset by growth from the Showtime direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription offering. 

Revenue comparisons in 2019 will be affected by fluctuations resulting from the timing of availability of television series for multiyear licensing agreements. In addition, the Company plans to increase its investment in content in 2019 in order to drive long-term subscriber growth on its direct-to-consumer digital streaming services. This will increase costs for the Cable Networks segment in 2019 compared to 2018.

Financial Position 

The balance sheet at December 31, 2018 is presented under ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard adopted on January 1, 2018, while December 31, 2017 is presented under previous accounting guidance. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the amount by which each balance sheet line item at December 31, 2018 was impacted by the adoption of ASC 606.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The increase primarily relates to the reclassification of the sales returns reserve to “Other current liabilities” as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 and higher receivables from television licensing arrangements.

(b) The increase primarily reflects the payment of sports program rights in advance of the broadcast of the related sporting events.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The increase primarily reflects higher investment in programming.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The decrease reflects lower noncurrent receivables from television licensing arrangements primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 partially offset by restricted cash of $120 million held in a grantor trust related to the separation and settlement agreement between the Company and the former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. (See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.) As of December 31, 2018, total outstanding receivables from television licensing arrangements, including both current and noncurrent, were $3.57 billion versus $4.06 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.45 billion at January 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606. At December 31, 2018, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.96 billion in 2019, $771 million in 2020, $430 million in 2021, $236 million in 2022, and $181 million in 2023 and thereafter.

Cash Flows 

The changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily driven by lower cash payments for income taxes and growth in affiliate and subscription fees, which were partially offset by an increased investment in internally-produced programming, including a higher number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms. Operating cash flow for 2017 also included discretionary pension contributions of $600 million to prefund the Company’s qualified plans. 

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by the aforementioned discretionary pension contributions; a decline in advertising revenues including from the benefit in 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of Super Bowl 50; and an increased investment in programming. These decreases were partially offset by higher affiliate and subscription fee revenues.

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating activities of CBS Radio. Operating activities from discontinued operations also included payments and refunds for tax matters in foreign jurisdictions related to previously disposed businesses that are accounted for as discontinued operations. 

Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash paid for income taxes in 2018 benefited from a federal income tax overpayment of $484 million in 2017, which included the impact from the retroactive renewal of a federal tax law. Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations for 2017 and 2016 benefited from the application of prior year federal income tax overpayments of $32 million and $90 million, respectively.

(a) Mainly includes the Company’s investment in The CW as well as its other domestic and international television joint ventures. 

(b) Capital expenditures for 2019 are anticipated to be approximately $200 million.

(c) 2018 primarily reflects the acquisition of a digital entertainment media company. 2017 primarily reflects the acquisition of Network 10, one of three major commercial broadcast networks in Australia, for approximately $124 million, net of cash acquired, and the acquisition of a television library. 2016 primarily reflects the acquisitions of a sports-focused digital media business and a publishing business.

Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations, and less capital expenditures; and adjusted free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and discretionary contributions to prefund the Company’s pension plans, and less capital expenditures. The Company’s calculations of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow include capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. Adjusted free cash flow excludes discretionary contributions to prefund the Company’s pension plans because management assesses the Company’s ability to generate operating cash flows without considering the impact from discretionary pension contributions, and decisions regarding the timing of pension plan funding are not dependent on the level of operating cash flows generated during the period. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are significant measures of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are among several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are primary measures used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry.

As free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, as the Company calculates them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as measures of liquidity have certain limitations, do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily measures of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow or adjusted free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow.

Dividends

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company declared total per share dividends of $.72, $.72, and $.66, respectively, which resulted in total annual dividends of $274 million, $289 million and $294 million, respectively. 

On January 31, 2019, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.18 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2019.

Share Repurchase Program

During 2018, the Company repurchased 11.5 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock under its share repurchase program for $600 million, at an average cost of $52.06 per share. At December 31, 2018, $2.46 billion of authorization remained under the share repurchase program.

Capital Structure

The following table sets forth the Company’s debt.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company issued $1.80 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds for the redemption and repayment of $1.20 billion of senior notes, of which $800 million was redeemed prior to maturity, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $49 million ($31 million, net of tax). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including discretionary contributions to the Company’s qualified pension plans and the repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. 

At December 31, 2018, the Company classified $600 million of debt maturing in August 2019 as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.

At December 31, 2018, the Company’s scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial Paper

The Company had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its $2.50 billion commercial paper program of $674 million and $679 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, each with maturities of less than 90 days. The weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was 3.02% and 1.88% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Credit Facility

At December 31, 2018, the Company had a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires in June 2021. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company’s option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 3.1x.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company’s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.

The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.49 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company’s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company’s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $2.49 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2018, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

The Company’s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for the Company’s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $2.63 billion is expected to come from the Company’s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

At December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.46 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2018, payments due by period under the Company’s significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $6.62 billion for sports programming rights, $1.71 billion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and $660 million for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding capital leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases.

(f) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities; participations due to producers; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the estimated tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS over eight years.

The table above excludes $266 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation. 

In 2019, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $60 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2019, the Company expects to contribute approximately $48 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company’s portion of benefit payments due under these plans. 

Guarantees

The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $100 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Programming and Production Costs

Accounting for the Company’s television production costs requires management’s judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and timing of the expensing of these costs.

Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test

The Company performs a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of television FCC licenses and international broadcast licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. 

II-40

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company’s television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2018 the Company had 14 television markets with FCC license book values. For international broadcast licenses, the Company considers all of its broadcast licenses within a country to be a single unit of accounting because the international broadcast licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2018, the Company had international broadcast licenses in Australia.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began including CBS Sports Network within the Television reporting unit, which is a component of the Entertainment operating segment, reflecting changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. Prior to this change, CBS Sports Network was a standalone reporting unit and a component of the Cable Networks operating segment. At December 31, 2018, the Company had seven reporting units with goodwill balances, each one level below their respective operating segments, except for the Cable Networks reporting unit and the Publishing reporting unit, which are each the same as their respective operating segments because these operating segments each have only one component.

Television FCC Licenses and International Broadcast Licenses- For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each market or country that management estimates the FCC licenses or international broadcast licenses have an aggregate fair value that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In selecting markets or international broadcast licenses for a qualitative assessment, the Company also considers the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2018 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for all 14 of its U.S. television markets. For each of these markets, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates, as well as the impact from recent tax law changes. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary. 

For 2018, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for international broadcast licenses. A quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the licenses with their carrying value. The estimated fair value is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall revenues in the relevant market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a five-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. The overall revenues in the subject market are estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the risk of achieving the projected cash flows, including the risk applicable to the industry and the market as a whole. The discount rate and perpetual nominal growth rate used for international broadcast licenses for 2018 were 11% and 0.5%, respectively. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of international broadcast licenses, which were recorded at fair value in the fourth quarter of 

II-41

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

2017 when the Company acquired Network 10, continues to approximate the carrying value and therefore no impairment charge was required. 

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses and international broadcast licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace in the U.S. or the advertising marketplace in Australia could result in a downward revision to the Company’s current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill-For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. For the 2018 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for seven reporting units. For each of these reporting units, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units, and that the lower tax rate from recent tax law changes would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that for these seven reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For 2018, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for the CBS Sports Network reporting unit prior to the inclusion of this business in the CBS Television reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, which is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For 2018, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method for CBS Sports Network resulted in similar estimated fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections and for 2018 was 2.0%. The discount rate, which for 2018 was 8.5%, is determined based on the risk of achieving the projected cash flows, including the risk applicable to the industry and the market as a whole.

II-42

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For the 2018 annual impairment test the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit, which at December 31, 2018 had a goodwill balance of $261 million, exceeded its carrying value by 16% and therefore no impairment charge was required. An increase to the discount rate of 83 basis points, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rate of 135 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit to fall below its carrying value.

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in its goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Reserves and Legal Matters

Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company’s pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2018, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income increased from the prior year-end due primarily to the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets, partially offset by the impact from an increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $92 million and would not have a material impact on 2019 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $6 million to 2019 pension expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters

for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $266 million at December 31, 2018 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

During 2017, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act on December 22, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $407 million for the estimated tax impact on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits. This amount was based on the Company’s initial estimate. During 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the provisional amounts and recorded a charge of $15 million to adjust the estimated transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. In January 2019, the U.S. government issued guidance relating to the transition tax. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, future guidance issued by federal and state authorities regarding the Tax Reform Act could have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Legal Matters 

General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the separation agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named. 

Investigation-Related Matters. As announced on August 1, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in recent press reports about the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of the Company. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced the completion of the investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’s employment. The Company has received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office has also requested information about these matters. The Company may receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against the 

II-44

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Company, certain current and former senior executives and members of the Board. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Separation Agreement. On September 9, 2018, the Company entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Leslie Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Company is contributing the aggregate amount of $20 million toward various charitable organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace, which organizations were mutually agreed by the Company and Mr. Moonves. The Company has recorded the contribution of $20 million in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. In October 2018, the Company contributed $120 million to a grantor trust. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’s employment for cause under his employment agreement with the Company. Any dispute related to the Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves notified the Company of his election to demand binding arbitration with respect to this matter and the related Board investigation. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. The Company is currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual has been made for this matter in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had pending approximately 31,570 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 31,660 as of December 31, 2017 and 33,610 as of December 31, 2016. During 2018, the Company received approximately 3,290 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 3,380 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that

a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company’s total costs for the years 2018 and 2017 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $45 million and $57 million, respectively. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has remained generally flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $325 million and $410 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Interest Risk

The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017 but in the future may use derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rates.

Credit Risk

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2018 or 2017, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.
