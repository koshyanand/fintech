a unique ability to adapt to market changes and meet our customers’ needs. Because we aggregate product demand and production across these markets, we are able to generate significant volume - this volume drives down cost, which then increases demand, enabling a virtuous cycle of lower prices and higher unit volumes. Our manufacturing and supply processes are vertically integrated, minimizing lead times, facilitating prompt delivery, controlling costs and ensuring that components satisfy our high quality standards.

We have evolved our product suite over time, expanding our reach into markets that are adjacent to thermal imaging, with the intent of expanding the adoption and channel development for thermal imaging technology. Examples of this evolution include our entrance into the visible-image security and surveillance market, the maritime electronics market, the industrial machine vision market, and the traffic monitoring and signal control market. We intend to continue this evolution as we continue to lower the cost of advanced sensing products. As the cost to own thermal technology continues to decline, the application of these sensors is expanding beyond imaging to areas such as data acquisition where thermal sensors can provide important data that can be used for a wide variety of applications.

We believe that FLIR's brand is known for quality, innovation and trust and that customers are drawn to us for products and solutions that are effective, innovative, easy to use, and sold at competitive market prices. We intend to: continue to reduce the cost of thermal technology through higher volumes and new product and process improvements; innovate new applications and form-factors for our technology based on customer feedback; improve the customer experience through improved user-interface, ease-of-use, and software; increase customer loyalty and trust by providing world-class product warranties and support; and improve operational processes to realign resources to be nimble in response to customers’ needs and market trends.

TECHNOLOGY AND CAPABILITIES

Infrared is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is adjacent to the visible spectrum but is invisible to the human eye due to its longer wavelengths. Unlike visible light, infrared radiation (or heat) is emitted directly by all objects above absolute zero in temperature. Thermal imaging systems detect this infrared radiation and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then processed into a video signal and displayed on a video screen. Thermal sensors provide several benefits over ubiquitous visible light-based sensing technologies, including the ability to see in complete darkness, measure temperature remotely and without touching the surface of the object, image through obscurants such as smoke and fog, detect and discriminate living beings in an efficient and reliable way, see over long distances with minimal atmospheric interference, and image many types of otherwise invisible gases. For these reasons we feel the potential of our core technology to grow in prevalence and importance is significant, particularly as the cost to produce the technology continues to decline.

Thermal imaging systems are different than other types of “low light” night vision systems, such as visible light intensification systems used in green or gray sighted night vision goggles, because thermal imaging systems are not adversely affected by the presence of visible light, so they can be used day or night and are not susceptible to rapid changes in visible light levels. Thermal imaging systems are particularly well-suited for security applications involving the early detection of human activity due to the typically large temperature difference found between a human and the surrounding background. Since infrared systems are detecting emitted infrared radiation, they are passive - and thus more covert than certain “active” or “illuminated” infrared systems. Additionally, thermal imaging systems have the ability to measure absolute temperatures remotely, a critical feature for a variety of commercial, industrial, and scientific applications.

An infrared detector, which collects or absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electronic signal, is the primary component of thermal imaging systems. The two types of infrared detectors we manufacture and use in our systems are often referred to as “cooled” and “uncooled” detectors. Cooled detectors utilize a mechanical sterling cycle micro-cooler to reduce the operating temperature of the infrared sensor to approximately -200°C. These detectors offer very high sensitivity and spatial resolution for long-range applications or those applications requiring high measurement precision. Cooled detectors, while more sensitive and thus able to see farther, result in a product that is more expensive, heavier, more complex, and uses more power than those using uncooled detectors. Uncooled detectors operate at room temperature and do not require a micro-cooler, resulting in products that are lighter, use less power and are less expensive to produce than those using cooled detectors. The cost of both types of detectors is declining, and we expect to continue reducing costs as volumes rise and the technology advances.

We have expertise in the calibration and repair of our products, and maintain service facilities at many locations worldwide. Each of our service facilities have the capability to perform the complex calibrations required to service thermal imaging systems. We also maintain field service capabilities under the direction of our independent representatives or distributors in certain locations outside the United States.

As our customers have sought, and will continue to seek, new ways to address their needs and requirements in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, we have integrated thermal imaging with complementary technologies such as visible imaging, lasers, radar, and more. The following capabilities and disciplines are integrated into our business and processes:

3

System Design and Integration

We have developed extensive competencies in the design and integration of numerous capabilities and payloads into integrated systems or sub-systems. Competencies such as stabilization, packaging and systems integration allow us to effectively combine a wide variety of technologies and payloads to suit our customers’ needs. We strive to minimize the size, weight, power consumption, and cost in each of our product designs. 

Thermal Radiometry

Our ability to produce thermal imaging systems that can accurately measure temperature remotely is critical in many of our Industrial business unit markets. We have demonstrated know-how in designing and producing systems that can measure temperature to within very precise tolerances while maintaining accuracy and stability over time and over a wide range of ambient temperatures. We believe our skills in this area, known as thermal radiometry, offer an important competitive advantage over many of our competitors.

Mechanical Engineering

The design and production of thermal imaging systems involves highly sophisticated mechanical engineering techniques, particularly in the design and assembly of the supporting structures for system components such as detector arrays, micro-coolers, and optics. We also have expertise in designing stabilized assemblies used in our gimbal-mounted products utilizing precise electro-mechanical control, gyroscopes, electronic stabilization, and specialized optical control mechanisms. Also, through our 2016 acquisition of Prox Dynamics, we develop and manufacture nano-class UAS that are specifically designed to be man-portable and highly covert surveillance and reconnaissance sensors.

Infrared Detector Design Manufacturing

We design and manufacture both cooled and uncooled infrared detector arrays, in high volumes and at low costs. We believe our uncooled vanadium oxide microbolometers and cooled detectors using indium antimonide and indium gallium arsenide are among the highest performing infrared detectors of their type available in the world. We believe the internal design and manufacturing of these detectors provides significant cost and engineering advantages compared with the use of external sources.

Software is an increasingly important aspect of our overall engineering and design activity. We offer networking capabilities, video analytics, command and control, and advanced firmware in our camera and other sensing systems. Many of our products are supported by a software eco-system that includes dedicated desktop and mobile platform applications. Our products are typically developed with broad compatibility with common industry standards and protocols.

Optical Design, Fabrication and Coating

We design and manufacture sophisticated infrared optics using materials such as silicon, germanium, and zinc selenide that are required to produce a thermal imaging system. This capability allows us to rapidly develop optics optimized for use with our cameras and avoid costs and delays associated with reliance on third-party optics suppliers. We also have the capability to produce silicon wafer-level micro-optics at high volumes and the ability to apply custom multi-layer, vapor-deposited coatings to improve the transmission of the lens materials that are used in infrared systems.

Micro-Coolers

We manufacture some of the industry’s smallest, lightest, and lowest power micro-coolers for use in cooling infrared detectors. Our coolers are especially effective in hand-held applications, where light weight and long battery life are essential.

4

Lasers and Laser Components

Many of our more sophisticated systems are increasingly being offered with various types of laser payloads, including pointers, illuminators, rangefinders, and designators. We design and manufacture purpose-built laser rangefinders and designators for inclusion in some of our gimbaled multi-sensor systems. We also manufacture certain laser-related materials and components for external customers. 

Tactical Platforms

We develop and manufacture comprehensive and integrated solutions for surveillance, assessment, and response. These platform solutions draw from our Government and Defense business unit products, as well as products sourced outside of the Company. These unmanned and manned networkable mobile and vehicle mounted systems can be deployed in nearly any environment and have provided security at borders, at theme parks, for police and military forces, at national monuments, and at high-profile events, both in the United States and internationally.

STRATEGY

Our task and purpose are to exceed our commitments with integrity and to innovate the World’s Sixth Sense to save lives and livelihoods. Our vision is to do this while revolutionizing human perception. Our mission is to innovate technologies that increase awareness and insight so that professionals can make more informed decisions that save lives and livelihoods. To achieve these objectives, we centered our strategy on three key priorities: Fuel, Feed, Focus, with The FLIR Method as the foundation supporting these priorities. 

Fuel 

We strive to fuel our business by capturing significant near-term opportunities that help us gain scale and secure leading market positions in attractive markets. Success in these initiatives will give us the ability to make longer-term investments. Examples include winning key business opportunities, we identify as franchise programs, in each of our three business units over the next 12 to 36 months. We are strategically dedicating resources, and working aggressively, to capture these opportunities.

Feed 

We seek to feed our business by investing in technologies and market opportunities that are part of our longer-term strategic roadmap. Examples include investments in differentiated technologies and moving to consolidate stronger positions in attractive markets. These efforts will enable longer-term, 3- to 5-year growth trajectories. In many cases, these technologies or markets are nascent or underdeveloped and it will take time, commitment, and investment to fully realize their potential. Our intent is to move from making the world’s best sensors, to sensing, and ultimately to intelligent sensing solutions to help our customers make decisions that save lives and livelihoods.

Focus 

We intend to focus our business on areas of strength where we can maximize competitiveness across the Company. Throughout the company, there are opportunities to focus or refocus parts of the business to fuel and feed other parts. Examples include, but are not limited to, divesting non-core assets, exiting unattractive end markets, and focusing capital structure for inorganic growth. We aim to continuously capture efficiencies across the company in order to leverage available resources to maximize portfolio return. 

The FLIR Method

The FLIR Method ("TFM") forms the foundation of our strategic priorities to fuel, feed, and focus the business. TFM consists of six distinct elements: Talent Development, Lean Management, One FLIR, Acquisition and Integration Discipline, Continuous Improvement, and Customer-Driven Innovation. It is the method in which we will mature into a world-class operating company, and is intended to empower a creative, curious and constantly learning organization. By continuously improving our global operations through TFM, we aim to self-fund many of the investments required over the strategic horizon and maximize the efficiency of our human capital.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Industrial Business Unit

The Industrial business unit develops hand-held, fixed mount, and desktop imaging and measurement products, and thermal and visible spectrum imaging camera cores and related components. Thermal imaging camera products detect and measure heat and surface temperature differences, offering high accuracy, sophisticated diagnostic functionality, and a product range that spans a wide price spectrum. These thermal cameras and related products are utilized by a growing number of industrial plant professionals, residential construction and contracting firms, energy production workers, manufacturing equipment and production line technicians, tradesmen, and homeowners. 

The Industrial business unit offers a broad range of cooled and uncooled thermal products, with thermal cameras for laboratory and research and development applications; optical gas imagers for oil, power, and chemical production applications; highly ruggedized cameras for firefighters that are used for fire attack, overhaul, and search-and-rescue operations; fixed and pan-tilt thermal cameras for factory line automation and plant safety monitoring; and multiple lines of professional and mid-level thermal cameras for building analysis, predictive maintenance, and electrical systems analysis.

Under our FLIR and Extech brands, the Industrial business unit provides a comprehensive line of rugged and reliable test and measurement instruments, such as moisture meters, electrical test clamp meters, power analyzers, and multi-functional meters. These measurement instruments are used to evaluate electrical and environmental factors, including voltage, sound, light, heat index, and water quality. Leveraging our low-cost thermal sensors, we augment and enhance these familiar tools used in many industrial and commercial trades with Infrared Guided Measurement ("IGM"). IGM allows users to more efficiently address issues by first discovering via a thermal image the precise area of over-heating, moisture damage, or air ingress, allowing them to then apply the relevant sensor, such as voltage, current, spot temperature, or moisture probe, at the point of concern.

The Industrial business unit also offers thermal camera cores, an integrated, plug-and-play camera system that includes the infrared or visible spectrum sensor as well as the related image processing electronics and an optical lens. We offer cooled and uncooled thermal cores that are based on long wave infrared ("LWIR"), mid-wave infrared ("MWIR"), and short wave infrared ("SWIR") sensors. Our visible spectrum camera cores are utilized primarily for machine vision and people counting applications and are based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductors ("CMOS") and charged-coupled device ("CCD") sensors that are produced by third parties. We also sell to third parties thermal sensors and readout integrated circuit ("ROIC") products, which are used to convert pixel-level information into digital information, essential in the design of infrared, visible, ultra violet, and X-Ray sensors.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing capability, built over many years, enables us to provide thermal camera core and component products to other FLIR business units at low cost, as well as sell cores and components to third party customers. Our cores and components are designed for easy and efficient integration into higher levels of product assembly. Third party OEMs integrate these cores and components into their own branded products. We operate under this model so to aggregate the largest amount of volume possible, which lowers our total cost to produce camera cores and components.

The Industrial business unit also houses our emerging markets businesses, which are businesses that are identified as high-potential but do not yet have the scale to represent their own segment. Included in our emerging markets business is our mobile products business, makers of thermal imaging accessories for the smartphone market, and our commercial UAS business, which provides thermal cameras and cores for use on, or integration into, UAS systems, which are often referred to as “drones.”

Markets

OEM 

We supply cooled and uncooled thermal and visible spectrum camera cores, sensors, and readout integrated circuits ("ROICs") on an OEM basis to an array of manufacturers of finished products in both the military and commercial spaces. These customers require a product at a lower level of integration than a fully developed thermal imaging system. Examples of major OEM applications in the Industrial business unit are military defense, automotive advanced driver assistance systems, industrial automation systems, UAS, firefighting, smartphones, medical devices, digital X-ray, and security.

Building and HVAC/R  

Thermal imaging cameras are increasingly used by building and home inspectors, roofing specialists, plumbers, general contractors, and real estate firms to evaluate and measure the integrity of buildings by quickly revealing structural problems, such as air leaks and missing insulation, to help ensure efficient use of energy and other resources. HVAC/R and mechanical contractors use thermal cameras and test and measurement equipment to ensure comfort in residences and workplaces by discovering, monitoring, and documenting airflow, leaks, and temperatures in ductwork and other forms of heating/cooling distribution systems. Hand-held test and measurement tools are used to measure airflow, humidity, carbon monoxide levels, light, sound, and other environmental factors.

Electrical 

Electricians and mechanical technicians utilize thermal cameras and test and measurement equipment to quickly conduct electrical diagnostics, such as identifying circuit overloads, finding loose wire connections, and measuring currents, all without having to touch dangerous components. From overheating electrical circuits to corroded connections, thermal cameras and test meters provide the diagnostic functions needed to verify correct installations, quickly trace the source of problems, and enable efficient electrical systems. Hand-held test and measurement tools are used to measure currents, voltage, resistance, continuity, and other electrical parameters.

Predictive maintenance 

Thermal imaging systems are used for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. Such monitoring enables factory and plant maintenance technicians to quickly reveal equipment faults, manifested as hot or cold spots, so they can be repaired before they fail. This increases equipment productivity and avoids catastrophic failures or major damage, which reduces operating expenses by lowering repair costs and reducing downtime. Improved functionality of image analysis software, smaller size and weight, and simplicity of system operation are critical factors for this well-established market segment. Hand-held test and measurement tools are used to measure airflow, humidity, carbon monoxide levels, sound, vibration and other environmental factors.

Machine Vision

Advanced visible imaging cameras and solutions provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as industrial automation systems, medical diagnostic equipment, people counting systems, intelligent traffic systems, military and defense products, security monitoring, vehicle guidance, and advanced mapping systems. These systems and solutions improve the efficiency, quality, analysis, and safety of a wide range of processes and products. 

Oil and gas production 

Thermal imaging cameras can visualize and pinpoint certain gas leaks. In industrial, utility, and oil and gas refinery settings, optical gas imagers visually reveal plumes of gases such as SF6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from a safe distance. Optical gas imaging cameras can continuously scan installations in remote areas or in zones that are difficult to access. Continuous monitoring allows the user to be informed when a dangerous or costly gas leak appears. Typical examples are monitoring pipelines, petrochemical industry and offshore operations.

Research and science 

High-end thermal imaging systems provide the unique ability to detect very small differences in temperature. This capability is useful in industrial R&D, where developers study, see, and quantify the heat dissipation, stress tolerance, and thermal characteristics of their materials, components, and products. At colleges and universities, instructors use thermal imagery to help students visualize the theories of heat transfer and thermodynamics, improving student comprehension of key concepts, and for both fundamental and applied research. In the defense sector, cooled thermal imaging cameras are used in the development of firearms, ammunition, guided missiles, and aircraft.

Firefighting  

Thermal imaging is a well-known technology in the firefighting market, with firefighters and first responders worldwide utilizing thermal imaging cameras for protecting their own life and saving the lives of others. Thermal imaging technology allows first responders to assess conditions of a space prior to and after entry by providing them the ability to see through most forms of smoke.

This also allows them to search for people and animals and identify fire hot spots in burning buildings or smoke filled environments. Providing the ability to measure temperatures in a non-contact mode from a safe distance helps firefighters to protect themselves against dangerous phenomena like roll-overs and flash-overs.

Manufacturing process control 

Temperature consistency is critical to the quality of many manufactured components, materials, and products, including metals, plastics, paper, and glass. Thermal cameras, both fixed and mobile, help factories ensure product quality and identify other defects in both products and in the manufacturing process itself through the continuous monitoring of the production line, resulting in higher output and nearly perfect quality control. Other users of thermal cameras in the manufacturing sectors include worker safety and fire prevention, analysis of welding and fastening effectiveness, food inspection, packaging quality, and electronic and mechanical component manufacturing, ranging in size from small hybrid integrated circuits to jet engines.

Mobile 

Leveraging our ability to produce thermal sensors at a low cost and with low size, weight, and power consumption, we created a line of personal thermal imaging cameras that attach to smartphones. The mass adoption of smartphones has driven significant growth in the development of tools that extend the utility of these devices, and our FLIR ONE® products do this by empowering consumers with thermal imaging on their smartphones. We believe that the potential of thermal imaging as a tool for consumers provides this segment with an emerging opportunity for growth.

Sales and Distribution

Our Industrial business unit has a direct sales staff and a network of distributors and retailers covering major markets worldwide, including technical and customer support staff in the United States and internationally who provide application development, technical training, and operational assistance to direct and indirect sales personnel as well as to customers.
