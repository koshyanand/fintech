ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 47 manufacturing facilities in 21 countries, including the United States. We operate our business through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific.

During the third quarter of 2018, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with Bridgestone that combined our company-owned wholesale distribution business and Bridgestone’s tire wholesale warehouse business to create TireHub, a national tire distributor in the United States. TireHub provides U.S. tire dealers and retailers with a comprehensive range of passenger and light truck tires from two of the world’s leading tire companies, with an emphasis on satisfying the rapidly growing demand for larger rim diameter premium tires. TireHub is now our sole authorized national tire distributor in the United States. 

TireHub has distribution and warehouse locations throughout the United States and is expected to have the scale to reach the vast majority of retail locations in the U.S. daily. TireHub is also expected to provide a superior, fully integrated distribution, warehousing, sales and delivery solution that is expected to provide enhanced fill rates and turnaround times — enabling dealers to quickly access the products they need and manage the growing complexity in the tire business driven by SKU proliferation.

Results of Operations

In 2018, we experienced challenging global industry conditions, including higher raw material costs, foreign currency headwinds due to a strong U.S. dollar, and volatility in emerging markets, including softening industry conditions in China. We experienced a recovery in demand for consumer replacement tires in the United States and Europe, driven by our sales of 17-inch and above rim size tires that outperformed the industry.

In order to continue to drive growth in our business and address the challenging economic environment, we remain focused on our key strategies by:

•Developing great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers;

•Building the value of our brand, helping our customers win in their markets, and becoming consumers’ preferred choice; and

•Improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service.

We also announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from $0.14 per share to $0.16 per share, beginning with the December 3, 2018 payment date.

Our tire unit shipments in 2018 were consistent with 2017. In 2018, we realized approximately $301 million of cost savings, including raw material cost saving measures of approximately $80 million, which exceeded the impact of general inflation. Our raw material costs, including cost saving measures, increased by approximately 4% in 2018 compared to 2017.

Net sales were $15,475 million in 2018, compared to $15,377 million in 2017. Net sales increased in 2018 primarily due to an increase in price and product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, primarily in Americas.

Goodyear net income in 2018 was $693 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $346 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in 2017. The increase in Goodyear net income in 2018 was driven by the net gain recognized in relation to the TireHub transaction, a decrease in income tax expense, primarily due to the recognition of discrete tax charges in 2017 in connection with changes in U.S. income tax law, and lower rationalization charges. These increases were partially offset by lower segment operating income, primarily in Americas and Asia Pacific.

Our total segment operating income for 2018 was $1,274 million, compared to $1,556 million in 2017. The $282 million, or 18.1%, decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, lower income in other tire-related businesses, higher selling, administrative and general expense ("SAG"), unfavorable foreign currency translation, primarily in Americas, and decreases in price and product mix, primarily in Americas. These impacts were partially offset by lower conversion costs. Refer to "Results of Operations — Segment Information” for additional information.

Liquidity

At December 31, 2018, we had $801 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $3,151 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $1,043 million and $3,196 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Cash flows from operating activities of $916 million, which are driven by the profitability of our SBUs, together with net borrowings of $135 million were used to fund capital expenditures of $811 million, common stock repurchases of $220 million and dividends paid on our common stock of $138 million. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.

Outlook

We expect to continue to experience challenging global industry conditions, including higher raw material costs, foreign currency headwinds and volatility in emerging markets, in 2019. We expect to see benefits from the ramp-up of our new Americas manufacturing facility and TireHub, pricing actions that we implemented in 2018, and continued strong performance in our sales of 17-inch and above consumer replacement tires.

For the full year of 2019, we expect our raw material costs will be up approximately $300 million compared to 2018, excluding raw material cost saving measures. Natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices historically have experienced significant volatility, and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials. We are continuing to focus on price and product mix, to substitute lower cost materials where possible, to work to identify additional substitution opportunities, to reduce the amount of material required in each tire, and to pursue alternative raw materials.

Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of the factors that may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and “Forward-Looking Information — Safe Harbor Statement” for a discussion of our use of forward-looking statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONSOLIDATED

All per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net income (loss).

2018 Compared to 2017 

Goodyear net income in 2018 was $693 million, or $2.89 per share, compared to $346 million, or $1.37 per share, in 2017. The increase in Goodyear net income in 2018 was driven by the net gain recognized in relation to the TireHub transaction, a decrease in income tax expense, primarily due to the recognition of discrete tax charges in 2017 in connection with changes in U.S. income tax law, and lower rationalization charges. These increases were partially offset by lower segment operating income, primarily in Americas and Asia Pacific.

Net Sales

Net sales in 2018 of $15,475 million increased $98 million, or 0.6%, compared to $15,377 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in price and product mix of $217 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $139 million, primarily in Americas. Goodyear worldwide tire unit net sales were $13,197 million and $12,958 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales were $9,167 million and $3,002 million, respectively, in 2018. Consumer and commercial net sales were $9,285 million and $2,928 million, respectively, in 2017.

The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Worldwide tire unit sales in 2018 were consistent with 2017 at 159.2 million units. Replacement tire units increased 1.6 million units, or 1.5%, primarily in EMEA. OE tire units decreased 1.6 million units, or 3.6%, in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Americas. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2018 were 145.5 million and 11.8 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2017 were 145.9 million and 11.5 million, respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold (“CGS”) was $11,961 million in 2018, increasing $281 million, or 2.4%, from $11,680 million in 2017. CGS was 77.3% of sales in 2018 compared to 76.0% of sales in 2017. CGS in 2018 increased due to higher costs related to product mix of $238 million, higher raw material costs of $186 million, higher costs in other tire-related businesses of $50 million, driven by an increase in raw material prices related to third-party chemical sales in Americas, higher transportation costs of $18 million, and higher research and development costs of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation of $104 million, primarily in Americas, favorable indirect tax settlements in Brazil of $53 million, of which $51 million ($39 million after-tax and minority) is related to prior years, and lower conversion costs of $42 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas. CGS in 2018 included pension expense of $15 million compared to $16 million in 2017. CGS in 2018 and 2017 also included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $41 million and $49 million, respectively.

CGS in 2018 included accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $4 million ($3 million after-tax and minority). CGS in 2017 included accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million ($28 million after-tax and minority), primarily related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany.

 23
Selling, Administrative and General Expense

SAG was $2,312 million in 2018, increasing $33 million, or 1.4%, from $2,279 million in 2017. SAG was 14.9% of sales in 2018 compared to 14.8% of sales in 2017. The increase in SAG was primarily due to inflation, higher advertising costs of $19 million, and higher product liability costs of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by lower wages and benefits of $48 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization plans. SAG in 2018 included pension expense of $17 million compared to $19 million in 2017. SAG in 2018 and 2017 also included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $34 million and $42 million, respectively.

Rationalizations

We recorded net rationalization charges of $44 million ($32 million after-tax and minority) in 2018. Net rationalization charges include charges of $31 million related to global plans to reduce SAG headcount, $13 million related to plans to reduce manufacturing headcount and improve operating efficiency in EMEA, and $15 million related to the closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany. Net rationalization charges in 2018 included reversals of $19 million for actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes.

We recorded net rationalization charges of $135 million ($93 million after-tax and minority) in 2017. Net rationalization charges include charges of $46 million related to plans to reduce manufacturing headcount in EMEA, $35 million related to the closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $32 million related to global plans to reduce SAG headcount, and $20 million related to a separate plan to reduce SAG headcount in EMEA.

Upon completion of the 2018 plans, we estimate that annual segment operating income will improve by approximately $38 million ($28 million SAG and $10 million CGS), primarily related to our global plans to reduce SAG headcount. The savings realized in 2018 from rationalization plans totaled $75 million ($41 million CGS and $34 million SAG).

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $321 million in 2018, decreasing $14 million from $335 million in 2017. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate to 5.16% in 2018 compared to 5.58% in 2017. This decrease was partially offset by higher average debt balances of $6,218 million in 2018 compared to $6,001 million in 2017. Interest expense in 2017 included $6 million ($4 million after-tax and minority) of expense related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts related to the redemption of our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022.

Other (Income) Expense

Other (Income) Expense in 2018 was income of $174 million, compared to expense of $70 million in 2017. The $244 million change in Other (Income) Expense was primarily due to the net gain recognized on the TireHub transaction, net of transaction costs, of $272 million ($206 million after-tax and minority) and interest income on favorable indirect tax settlements in Brazil of $38 million ($29 million after-tax and minority). These gains were partially offset by an increase in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $59 million, driven by lower expected returns on pension plan assets of $32 million.

Non-service related pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $121 million in 2018 includes pension settlement charges of $22 million ($17 million after-tax and minority) and a one-time charge of $9 million ($7 million after-tax and minority) related to the adoption of the new accounting standards update which no longer allows non-service related pension and other postretirement benefits cost to be capitalized in inventory. Non-service related pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $62 million in 2017 includes pension settlement charges of $19 million ($13 million after-tax and minority).

Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2017 includes a premium of $25 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) related to the redemption of our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022.

General and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products in 2018 includes a benefit of $3 million ($3 million after-tax and minority) as compared to a benefit in 2017 of $5 million ($3 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers.

Net (gains) losses on asset sales were a gain of $1 million ($1 million after-tax and minority) in 2018 as compared to a gain of $14 million ($13 million after-tax and minority) in 2017. Net gains (losses) on asset sales in 2017 included a gain of $6 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. 

Other (Income) Expense in 2018 included charges of $12 million ($12 million after-tax and minority), compared to charges of $14 million ($11 million after-tax and minority) in 2017, for hurricane related expenses. Other (Income) Expense in 2018 also included $4 million ($3 million after-tax and minority) for legal claims related to discontinued operations.

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 5, Other (Income) Expense.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense in 2018 was $303 million on income before income taxes of $1,011 million. In 2018, income tax expense was unfavorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of $65 million ($65 million after minority interest). Discrete adjustments were primarily due to charges totaling $135 million related to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits, partially offset by a tax benefit of $88 million related to a worthless stock deduction created by permanently ceasing operations of our Venezuelan subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2018. Income tax expense in 2018 also included net charges of $18 million for various other discrete tax adjustments, including those related to finalizing our accounting for certain provisional items related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017 (the "Tax Act") as discussed below.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we wrote off $37 million in deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits that expired during the year and established a valuation allowance of $98 million against foreign tax credits expiring primarily in 2021, as we have now concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these credits prior to their expiration. These charges reflect the recognition of the $88 million discrete tax benefit related to our Venezuelan subsidiary that reduced taxable income that otherwise would have utilized foreign tax credits. We also considered our forecasts of future profitability in assessing our ability to realize our foreign tax credits. These forecasts were prepared in connection with our annual budgeting process and include the impact of recent trends, including various macroeconomic factors such as rising raw material prices, on our profitability, as well as the impact of tax planning strategies. Macroeconomic factors, including raw material prices, possess a high degree of volatility and can significantly impact our profitability. As such, there is a risk that future foreign source income will not be sufficient to fully utilize these foreign tax credits. However, we believe our forecasts of future profitability along with three significant sources of foreign income provide us sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the remaining foreign tax credits of $637 million will be fully utilized, despite the negative evidence of their limited carryforward periods. For further information regarding our foreign source income, refer to Critical Accounting Policies.

The Tax Act established a corporate income tax rate of 21%, replacing the former 35% rate, and created a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system, which generally eliminated the U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The transition to the territorial system included a one-time transition tax on certain of our foreign earnings previously untaxed in the United States (the "transition tax"). The Securities and Exchange Commission provided up to a one-year measurement period for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation. As required, we finalized our accounting for items previously considered provisional during 2018. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an initial non-cash net charge to tax expense of $299 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. Our final accounting has adjusted this non-cash net charge to $298 million. This net charge includes a deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate. No measurement period adjustment was necessary and this calculation is complete. The net charge also originally included a provisional deferred tax benefit of $162 million to reverse reserves maintained for the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under prior law, net of reserves established for foreign withholding taxes consistent with our revised indefinite reinvestment assertion. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized our accounting and increased the provisional amount by $9 million to $171 million to reflect U.S. tax guidance issued during the year and to reflect our final indefinite reinvestment assertion. We were able to reasonably estimate the transition tax and recorded an initial provisional tax obligation of $77 million at December 31, 2017. In general, the transition tax imposed by the Tax Act results in the taxation of our accumulated foreign earnings and profits (“E&P”) at a 15.5% rate on liquid assets and 8% on the remaining unremitted foreign E&P, both net of foreign tax credits. Adjusted for U.S. tax guidance issued during 2018 and the impact of changes to E&P of our subsidiaries resulting from the filing of our 2017 corporate income tax return during the fourth quarter of 2018, we have now finalized our accounting and recognized an additional measurement period adjustment of $8 million, resulting in a total transition tax obligation of $85 million.

On January 15, 2019, the IRS finalized regulations that govern the transition tax. We are in the process of analyzing these regulations. We do not expect any material impact to our financial statements as a consequence of the final regulations. 

Income tax expense in 2017 was $513 million on income before income taxes of $878 million. In 2017, tax expense was unfavorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of $294 million due primarily to the net non-cash tax charge of $299 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act as described above.

At December 31, 2018, our valuation allowance on certain of our U.S. federal, state and local deferred tax assets was $113 million, primarily related to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits as described above, and our valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets was $204 million. 

Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. Each reporting period we assess available positive and negative evidence and estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize these existing deferred tax assets. We do not believe that sufficient positive evidence required to release all or a significant portion of these valuation allowances will exist within the next twelve months. 

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.

Minority Shareholders’ Net Income

Minority shareholders’ net income was $15 million in 2018, compared to $19 million in 2017. 

2017 Compared to 2016

Goodyear net income in 2017 was $346 million, or $1.37 per share, compared to $1,264 million, or $4.74 per share, in 2016. The decrease in Goodyear net income in 2017 was driven by an increase in income tax expense, primarily due to recognition of discrete tax charges in 2017 in connection with changes in U.S. income tax law compared to the recognition of discrete tax benefits in 2016, primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances, and lower segment operating income, primarily in Americas and EMEA. These items were partially offset by a decrease in rationalization charges and lower corporate SAG, primarily due to lower incentive compensation.

Net Sales

Net sales in 2017 of $15,377 million increased $219 million, or 1.4%, compared to $15,158 million in 2016 due to an increase in price and product mix of $521 million, primarily driven by the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, favorable foreign currency translation of $178 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, and higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $89 million, driven by higher prices for third-party chemical sales in Americas. These increases were partially offset by lower tire unit volume of $569 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas. Goodyear worldwide tire unit net sales were $12,958 million and $12,832 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales were $9,285 million and $2,928 million, respectively, in 2017. Consumer and commercial net sales were $9,414 million and $2,806 million, respectively, in 2016.

The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 6.9 million units, or 4.2%, compared to 2016, included a decrease of 3.8 million replacement tire units, or 3.3%, comprised primarily of decreases in EMEA and Americas. OE tire units decreased 3.1 million units, or 6.4%, comprised primarily of decreases in Americas and EMEA. The overall volume decreases in EMEA and Americas were primarily related to lower consumer tire sales, driven by increased competition and changes in OEM production. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2017 were 145.9 million and 11.5 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2016 were 153.0 million and 11.6 million, respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold 

CGS was $11,680 million in 2017, increasing $745 million, or 6.8%, from $10,935 million in 2016. CGS was 76.0% of sales in 2017 compared to 72.1% of sales in 2016. CGS in 2017 increased due to higher raw material costs of $618 million, foreign currency translation of $141 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, higher conversion costs of $129 million, primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes in Americas and EMEA, higher costs in other tire-related businesses of $107 million, driven by an increase in raw material prices related to third-party chemical sales in Americas, and higher costs related to product mix of $101 million. These increases were partially offset by lower volume of $403 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas. CGS in 2017 included pension expense of $16 million compared to $15 million in 2016.

CGS in 2017 included accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million ($28 million after-tax and minority), primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany. Accelerated depreciation was $20 million ($20 million after-tax and minority) in 2016, primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and our plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility.

 26
Selling, Administrative and General Expense

SAG was $2,279 million in 2017, decreasing $130 million, or 5.4%, from $2,409 million in 2016. SAG was 14.8% of sales in 2017 compared to 15.9% of sales in 2016. The decrease in SAG was due to lower wages and benefits of $105 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization plans, and lower advertising costs of $49 million. These decreases were partially offset by foreign currency translation of $27 million, primarily in EMEA, and increases due to general inflation. SAG in 2017 and 2016 included pension expense of $19 million for each year.

Rationalizations

We recorded net rationalization charges of $135 million ($93 million after-tax and minority) in 2017. Net rationalization charges include charges of $46 million related to plans to reduce manufacturing headcount in EMEA, $35 million related to the closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $32 million related to global plans to reduce SAG headcount, and $20 million related to SAG headcount reductions in EMEA.

We recorded net rationalization charges of $210 million ($198 million after-tax and minority) in 2016. Net rationalization charges included charges of $116 million related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $34 million related to a global plan to reduce SAG headcount, and $25 million related to manufacturing headcount reductions in EMEA.

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $335 million in 2017, decreasing $37 million from $372 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate to 5.58% in 2017 compared to 6.23% in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by higher average debt balances of $6,001 million in 2017 compared to $5,972 million in 2016. Interest expense in 2017 and 2016 included $6 million ($4 million after-tax and minority) and $12 million ($8 million after-tax and minority), respectively, of expense related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts related to the redemption of various debt instruments.

Other (Income) Expense

Other (Income) Expense in 2017 was expense of $70 million, compared to expense of $25 million in 2016. The $45 million change in Other (Income) Expense was primarily due to lower gains on general and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products of $27 million, higher non-service related pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $27 million, and lower gains on asset sales of $17 million. These increases were partially offset by lower financing fees and financial instruments expense of $28 million.

Non-service related pension and other postretirement benefits expense was $62 million in 2017, including pension settlement charges of $19 million ($13 million after-tax and minority), compared to $35 million in 2016, including pension settlement charges of $17 million ($14 million after-tax and minority). The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to lower expected returns on pension plan assets of $22 million and lower amortization of other postretirement benefits prior service credits of $16 million, which was partially offset by lower pension interest cost of $13 million.

General and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products in 2017 included a benefit of $5 million ($3 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers, as compared to a benefit in 2016 of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers and a benefit of $10 million related to changes in assumptions for probable insurance recoveries for asbestos claims in future periods.

Net (gains) losses on asset sales were a gain of $14 million ($13 million after-tax and minority) in 2017 as compared to a gain of $31 million ($26 million after-tax and minority) in 2016. Net (gains) losses on asset sales in 2017 included a gain of $6 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. Net (gains) losses on asset sales in 2016 included a gain of $16 million related to the sale of the former wire plant site and a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company.

Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2017 included a premium of $25 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) related to the redemption of our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022, as compared to premiums of $53 million ($37 million after-tax and minority) in 2016 related to the redemption of our $900 million 6.5% senior notes due 2021 and our €250 million 6.75% senior notes due 2019.

Other (Income) Expense in 2017 included charges of $14 million ($11 million after-tax and minority) for hurricane related expenses. 

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 5, Other (Income) Expense.

 27
Income Taxes

Income tax expense in 2017 was $513 million on income before income taxes of $878 million. In 2017, tax expense was unfavorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of $294 million due primarily to the net tax charge of $299 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act.

For 2016, the income tax benefit was $77 million on income before income taxes of $1,207 million. The net tax benefit in 2016 was driven by net discrete adjustments of $458 million ($459 million after minority interest), due primarily to a tax benefit of $331 million from the December 31, 2016 release of the valuation allowances on certain subsidiaries in England, France, Luxembourg and New Zealand. The release of the valuation allowances on these subsidiaries is net of 2016 tax law changes that reduced deferred tax assets by $23 million. The 2016 income tax benefit also included a $163 million tax benefit resulting from changing our election for our 2009, 2010 and 2012 U.S. tax years from deducting foreign taxes to crediting foreign taxes. The 2016 income tax benefit was net of a $39 million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance in the U.S. on deferred tax assets related to receivables from our deconsolidated Venezuelan subsidiary. 

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.

Minority Shareholders’ Net Income

Minority shareholders’ net income was $19 million in 2017, compared to $20 million in 2016.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — SEGMENT INFORMATION

Segment information reflects our strategic business units (“SBUs”), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis.

Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items.

Total segment operating income was $1,274 million in 2018, $1,556 million in 2017 and $1,996 million in 2016. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2018 was 8.2%, compared to 10.1% in 2017 and 13.2% in 2016.

Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs’ segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income before Income Taxes.

Americas

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017 

Americas unit sales in 2018 remained consistent with 2017. Replacement tire volume increased 0.3 million units, or 0.6%, primarily in our consumer business in the United States driven by growth in the wholesale distribution channel as well as growth in retail, supported by increased sell out. These increases were partially offset by the impacts of the TireHub transition and the national transportation strike in Brazil in May. OE tire volume decreased 0.3 million units, or 1.7%, primarily in our consumer business in the United States driven by increased competition, partially offset by an increase in our consumer business in Brazil, despite the impact of the national transportation strike.

Net sales in 2018 were $8,168 million, decreasing $44 million, or 0.5%, compared to $8,212 million in 2017. The decrease in net sales was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $144 million, primarily related to the Brazilian real. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $61 million, primarily driven by an increase in third-party sales of chemical products, and improvements in price and product mix of $36 million, driven by increased customer demand for our 17-inch and above rim size tires.

Operating income in 2018 was $654 million, decreasing $193 million, or 22.8%, from $847 million in 2017. The decrease in operating income was due to increased raw material costs of $113 million, lower price and product mix of $72 million, higher SAG of $36 million, primarily driven by higher product liability costs and advertising expense, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $25 million, and lower income in other tire-related businesses of $10 million, primarily in the race tire business. These decreases were partially offset by favorable indirect tax settlements in Brazil totaling $53 million, of which $51 million related to prior years, and favorable conversion costs of $14 million. SAG included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $15 million. During 2018, Americas operating income was negatively impacted by about $7 million ($5 million after-tax and minority) as a result of the national transportation strike in Brazil.

Operating income in 2018 excluded the net gain recognized on the TireHub transaction of $272 million, rationalization charges of $3 million and net gains on asset sales of $3 million. Operating income in 2017 excluded rationalization charges of $6 million and net gains on asset sales of $4 million.

Americas' results are highly dependent upon the United States, which accounted for approximately 81% of Americas' net sales in both 2018 and 2017. Results of operations in the United States are expected to continue to have a significant impact on Americas' future performance.

2017 Compared to 2016 

Americas unit sales in 2017 decreased 3.2 million units, or 4.4%, to 70.9 million units. OE tire volume decreased 1.7 million units, or 9.0%, primarily in consumer OE in the United States, driven by changes in OEM production. Replacement tire volume decreased 1.5 million units, or 2.8%, primarily in consumer replacement in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Declines in consumer replacement volumes in the United States were primarily driven by increased competition and lower volumes in 16-inch and below rim size tires. 

Net sales in 2017 were $8,212 million, increasing $40 million, or 0.5%, compared to $8,172 million in 2016. The increase in net sales was driven by improvements in price and product mix of $168 million, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $104 million, primarily driven by an increase in price for third-party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, primarily in Brazil. These increases in net sales were partially offset by lower tire volume of $281 million. 

Operating income in 2017 was $847 million, decreasing $304 million, or 26.4%, from $1,151 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was due to increased raw material costs of $266 million, which more than offset improvements in price and product mix of $131 million, unfavorable conversion costs of $98 million, primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes, lower tire unit volume of $79 million, and incremental start-up costs of $28 million associated with our new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by the impact of an out of period adjustment in 2016 of $24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012, and lower SAG of $16 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. SAG included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $23 million. During the third quarter of 2017, several Company facilities were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which negatively impacted Americas operating income by about $6 million in 2017. 

Operating income in 2017 excluded rationalization charges of $6 million and net gains on asset sales of $4 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded rationalization charges of $15 million, net gains on asset sales of $4 million and accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $1 million.

Europe, Middle East and Africa

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017 

Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2018 increased 0.7 million units, or 1.3%, to 57.8 million units. Replacement tire volume increased 1.5 million units, or 3.7%, primarily in our consumer business driven by increased industry demand in the 17-inch and above rim size segment. OE tire volume decreased 0.8 million units, or 4.9%, primarily in our consumer business, driven by declines in the 16-inch and below rim size segment as a result of the continuation of our OE selectivity strategy and changes in market demand.

Net sales in 2018 were $5,090 million, increasing $162 million, or 3.3%, compared to $4,928 million in 2017. Net sales increased due to improvements in price and product mix of $125 million, mainly due to increased customer demand for our 17-inch and above rim size tires, higher tire unit volume of $65 million, and favorable foreign currency translation of $22 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro, partially offset by the weakening of the Turkish lira. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $53 million mainly due to retread and race tire sales.

Operating income in 2018 was $363 million, decreasing $4 million, or 1.1%, compared to $367 million in 2017. Operating income decreased due to lower income in other tire-related businesses of $35 million, primarily due to lower intercompany sales, higher costs of $22 million, primarily related to transportation and research and development, and foreign currency translation of $6 million. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in price and product mix of $59 million, which more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs of $50 million, lower conversion costs of $23 million, primarily related to better plant utilization following the closure of our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, higher volume of $19 million, and lower SAG of $8 million. SAG and conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $19 million and $41 million, respectively.

 30
Operating income in 2018 excluded net rationalization charges of $36 million, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $4 million, and net losses on asset sales of $2 million. Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $111 million, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million, and net gains on asset sales of $10 million.

EMEA’s results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 37% and 38% of EMEA’s net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Results of operations in Germany are expected to continue to have a significant impact on EMEA’s future performance.

2017 Compared to 2016 

Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2017 decreased 4.0 million units, or 6.5%, to 57.1 million units. Replacement tire volume decreased 2.4 million units, or 5.5%, primarily in our consumer business caused by decreased industry demand for 16- inch and below rim size tires and increased competition. OE tire volume decreased 1.6 million units, or 9.0%, primarily in our consumer business, driven by 16-inch and below rim size tires, as a result of the continuation of our OE selectivity strategy, increased competition and reduced OEM production due to certain customers managing inventory levels.

Net sales in 2017 were $4,928 million, increasing $48 million, or 1.0%, compared to $4,880 million in 2016. Net sales increased due to improvements in price and product mix of $244 million, due to our increased focus on 17-inch and above rim size tires and the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, and favorable foreign currency translation of $112 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower tire unit volume of $303 million. 

Operating income in 2017 was $367 million, decreasing $105 million, or 22.2%, compared to $472 million in 2016. Operating income decreased due to higher raw material costs of $229 million, which more than offset improvements in price and product mix of $176 million, lower sales volume of $91 million and higher conversion costs of $31 million, primarily related to under-absorbed overhead due to lower production levels. These decreases were partially offset by lower SAG of $59 million, primarily driven by lower advertising costs, lower wages and benefits due to restructuring savings and lower incentive compensation, and favorable foreign currency translation of $9 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro. SAG and conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $19 million and $49 million, respectively.

Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $111 million, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million, and net gains on asset sales of $10 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million, accelerated depreciation of $19 million, and net gains on asset sales of $17 million.

Asia Pacific

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017 

Asia Pacific unit sales in 2018 decreased 0.7 million units, or 2.3%, to 30.5 million units. OE tire volume decreased 0.5 million units, or 4.5%, primarily in our consumer business in China as a result of reduced OEM production. Replacement tire volume decreased 0.2 million units, or 0.8%, primarily in our consumer business in China.

Net sales in 2018 were $2,217 million, decreasing $20 million, or 0.9%, from $2,237 million in 2017. Net sales decreased due to lower tire unit volume of $48 million, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $17 million, primarily related to the weakening of the Indian rupee, and lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $11 million, primarily in the retail business. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in price and product mix of $56 million.

Operating income in 2018 was $257 million, decreasing $85 million, or 24.9%, from $342 million in 2017. Operating income decreased due to higher raw material costs of $23 million, lower volume of $15 million, higher SAG of $12 million, higher research and development costs of $10 million, charges of $10 million related to a voluntary recall of consumer tires by an OE customer, lower price and product mix of $8 million, and lower income in other tire-related businesses of $8 million, primarily in the retail business. 

 31
Operating income in 2018 excluded net rationalization charges of $3 million. Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $2 million.

Asia Pacific’s results are highly dependent upon China and Australia. China accounted for approximately 27% and 28% of Asia Pacific's net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Australia accounted for approximately 27% of Asia Pacific’s net sales in both 2018 and 2017. Results of operations in China and Australia are expected to continue to have a significant impact on Asia Pacific's future performance.

2017 Compared to 2016 

Asia Pacific unit sales in 2017 increased 0.3 million units, or 0.7%, to 31.2 million units. Replacement tire volume increased 0.1 million units, or 0.5%, primarily due to growth in the consumer business, partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial business. OE tire volume increased 0.2 million units, or 1.1%, primarily due to growth in India, partially offset by lower volumes in China.

Net sales in 2017 were $2,237 million, increasing $131 million, or 6.2%, from $2,106 million in 2016. Net sales increased by $109 million due to improvements in price and product mix, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, $17 million due to favorable foreign currency translation, and $15 million due to higher tire volume. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $11 million, primarily in retail.

Operating income in 2017 was $342 million, decreasing $31 million, or 8.3%, from $373 million in 2016. Operating income decreased due to higher raw material costs of $123 million, which more than offset improvements in price and product mix of $113 million, a decrease in incentives recognized for the expansion of our factory in China of $13 million, and lower income in other tire-related businesses of $9 million, primarily in retail. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume of $4 million. 

Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $2 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded net gains on asset sales of $1 million and net rationalization charges of $1 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to:

•general and product liability and other litigation,

•workers’ compensation,

•recoverability of goodwill,

•deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions, and

•pensions and other postretirement benefits.

General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. We have recorded liabilities totaling $322 million, including related legal fees expected to be incurred, for potential product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, at December 31, 2018. General and product liability and other litigation liabilities are recorded based on management’s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products previously manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts.

We periodically, and at least annually, update, using actuarial analyses, our existing reserves for pending claims, including a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries. In determining the estimate of our asbestos liability, we evaluated claims over the next ten-year period. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and/or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $166 million at December 31, 2018. 

We maintain certain primary and excess insurance coverage under coverage-in-place agreements, and also have additional excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors.

As of December 31, 2018, we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $108 million, and we expect that approximately 65% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. Of this amount, $13 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts Receivable at December 31, 2018. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage-in-place agreements with certain primary and excess insurance carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our other excess insurance carriers. Although we believe these amounts are collectible under primary and certain excess policies today, future disputes with insurers could result in significant charges to operations.

Workers’ Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $224 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers’ compensation claims at December 31, 2018. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk-free rate of return.

For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers’ compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

Recoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $569 million at December 31, 2018.

 33
We test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured.

At October 31, 2018, after considering changes to assumptions used in our most recent quantitative annual testing for each reporting unit, including the capital markets environment, economic conditions, tire industry competition and trends, changes in our results of operations, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our most recent quantitative annual testing, and other factors, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative analysis.

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2018, we had valuation allowances aggregating $317 million against certain of our U.S. federal, state and local and foreign net deferred tax assets.

We record a reduction to the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing future profitability and the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in either our financial statements or tax returns.

We consider both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it may be objectively verified. Current and cumulative financial reporting results are a source of objectively verifiable evidence. We give operating results during the most recent three-year period a significant weight in our analysis. We typically only consider forecasts of future profitability when positive cumulative operating results exist in the most recent three-year period. We perform scheduling exercises to determine if sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character exists in the periods required in order to realize our deferred tax assets with limited lives (tax loss carryforwards and tax credits) prior to their expiration. We consider tax planning strategies available to accelerate taxable amounts if required to utilize expiring deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in our judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized.

Our net deferred tax assets include approximately $637 million of foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowances of $103 million, generated primarily from the receipt of foreign dividends. Our earnings and forecasts of future profitability along with three significant sources of foreign income provide us sufficient positive evidence to utilize these credits, despite the negative evidence of their limited carryforward periods. Those sources of foreign income are (1) 100% of our domestic profitability can be re-characterized as foreign source income under current U.S. tax law to the extent domestic losses have offset foreign source income in prior years, (2) annual net foreign source income, exclusive of dividends, primarily from royalties and (3) if necessary, we can enact tax planning strategies, including the ability to capitalize research and development costs annually, accelerate income on cross border sales of inventory or raw materials to our subsidiaries and reduce U.S. interest expense by, for example, reducing intercompany loans through repatriating current year earnings of foreign subsidiaries, all of which would increase our domestic profitability. 

We considered our forecasts of future profitability in assessing our ability to realize our foreign tax credits. These forecasts were prepared in connection with our annual budgeting process and include the impact of recent trends, including various macroeconomic factors such as rising raw material prices, on our profitability, as well as the impact of tax planning strategies. Macroeconomic factors, including raw material prices, possess a high degree of volatility and can significantly impact our profitability. As such, there is a risk that future foreign source income will not be sufficient to fully utilize these foreign tax credits. However, we believe our forecasts of future profitability along with the three significant sources of foreign income described above provide us sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the remaining foreign tax credits will be fully utilized prior to their various expiration dates.

We recognize the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances in the period in which legislation is enacted. We remeasure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tax rates at which they will be realized. We also consider the effects of enacted tax laws in our analysis of the need for valuation allowances. 

Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act subjects a U.S. parent to current tax on its "global intangible low-taxed income" ("GILTI"). We do not anticipate incurring a GILTI liability, however, to the extent that we incur expense under the GILTI provisions we will treat it as a component of income tax expense in the period incurred.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including those for transfer pricing. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the 

 34
liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize income tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize income tax benefits when, based on new information, we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and lead to recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded liabilities, resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. To reduce our risk of an unfavorable transfer price settlement, the Company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, supports pricing with economic studies and seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the settlement amount is lower than recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, would result in a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. 

For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, valuation allowances and the impact of the Tax Act, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. We have recorded liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits of $599 million and $231 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including:

•life expectancies,

•retirement rates,

•discount rates,

•long term rates of return on plan assets,

•inflation rates,

•future compensation levels,

•future health care costs, and

•maximum company-covered benefit costs.

Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The mortality assumption for our U.S. plans is based on actual historical experience, an assumed long term rate of future improvement based on published actuarial tables, and current government regulations related to lump sum payment factors. The long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is based on estimates of future long term rates of return similar to the target allocation of substantially all fixed income securities. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as-needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected.

The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.24% and 4.16%, respectively, at December 31, 2018, compared to 3.56% and 3.44%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The increase in the discount rate at December 31, 2018 was due primarily to higher yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $157 million in 2018, compared to $160 million in 2017 and $164 million in 2016. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $12 million in 2018, compared to $13 million in 2017 and $12 million in 2016. 

 35
The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation, and annual expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Changes in general interest rates and corporate (AA or better) credit spreads impact our discount rate and thereby our U.S. pension benefit obligation. Our U.S. pension plans are invested in a portfolio of substantially all fixed income securities designed to offset the impact of future discount rate movements on liabilities for these plans. If corporate (AA or better) interest rates increase or decrease in parallel (i.e., across all maturities), the investment portfolio described above is designed to mitigate a substantial portion of the expected change in our U.S. pension benefit obligation. For example, if corporate (AA or better) interest rates increased or decreased by 0.50%, the investment portfolio described above would be expected to mitigate more than 85% of the expected change in our U.S. pension benefit obligation.

At December 31, 2018, our net actuarial loss included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ("AOCL") related to global pension plans was $3,104 million, $2,493 million of which related to our U.S. pension plans. The net actuarial loss included in AOCL related to our U.S. pension plans is a result of declines in U.S. discount rates and plan asset losses that occurred prior to 2015, plus the impact of prior increases in estimated life expectancies. For purposes of determining our 2018 U.S. pension total benefits cost, we recognized $120 million of the net actuarial losses in 2018. We will recognize approximately $114 million of net actuarial losses in 2019 U.S. net periodic pension cost. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2018, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2019 before it begins to gradually decline. In addition, if annual lump sum payments from a pension plan exceed annual service and interest cost for that plan, accelerated recognition of net actuarial losses will be required through a settlement in total benefits cost.

The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was (1.9%), 8.7% and 6.9% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 4.58%, 5.08% and 5.33% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans.

The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. pension plans is approximately 18 years. 

Service cost of pension plans was recorded in CGS, as part of the cost of inventory sold during the period, or SAG in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, based on the specific roles (i.e., manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing) of employee groups covered by each of our pension plans. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 45% and 55% of service cost was included in CGS and SAG, respectively. Non-service related net periodic pension costs were recorded in Other (Income) Expense in line with the accounting standards update issued by the FASB to improve the financial statement presentation of pension and postretirement benefits cost. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1, Accounting Policies.

Globally we expect our 2019 net periodic pension cost to be approximately $125 million to $150 million, including approximately $30 million of service cost, compared to $110 million in 2018, which included $32 million of service cost. The increase in expected net periodic pension cost is primarily due to higher interest cost for our U.S. pension plans from increases in interest rates and lower expected returns on plan assets for our non-U.S. pension plans due to an increase in investments allocated to fixed income securities.

We experienced an increase in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2018 but a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $25 million for our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining 2018 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $4 million of net actuarial losses in 2018. We will recognize approximately $4 million of net actuarial losses in 2019. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2018, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2019 before it begins to gradually decline.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital.

On March 7, 2018, we amended and restated our $400 million second lien term loan facility. As a result of the amendment, the term loan now matures on March 7, 2025 and continues to bear interest at 200 basis points over LIBOR.

On September 28, 2018, certain of our European subsidiaries amended and restated the definitive agreements for our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility, extending the term through 2023.

On October 9, 2018, we announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from $0.14 per share to $0.16 per share, beginning with the December 3, 2018 payment date. 

For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2018, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview.”

At December 31, 2018, we had $801 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents, compared to $1,043 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $242 million was primarily due to cash used for investing activities of $867 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $811 million; and cash used for financing activities of $243 million, primarily related to common stock repurchases of $220 million and common stock dividends of $138 million, partially offset by net borrowings of $135 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash flows from operating activities of $916 million, driven by the profitability of our operating segments.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017 we had $3,151 million and $3,196 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations in the period in which it occurs.

We expect our 2019 cash flow needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. We also expect interest expense to range between $325 million and $350 million, restructuring payments to be approximately $50 million, dividends on our common stock to be approximately $150 million, and contributions to our funded non-U.S. pension plans to be approximately $25 million to $50 million. We expect working capital to be a use of cash of less than $100 million in 2019. We intend to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations.

We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2019 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment.

Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In 

 37
certain countries where we operate, such as China and South Africa, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third-party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and/or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and/or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Chinese and South African subsidiaries, which are subject to such requirements or limitations, to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2018, approximately $697 million of net assets, including $98 million of cash and cash equivalents, were subject to such requirements. The requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of China and South Africa have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries. 

Cash Position

At December 31, 2018, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $916 million in 2018, compared to $1,158 million in 2017 and $1,557 million in 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 decreased $242 million compared to 2017, primarily due to a $282 million decrease in segment operating income. 

Cash used for working capital in 2018 was $120 million compared to $106 million in 2017. Cash used for inventory increased $127 million, while cash provided by accounts payable increased $138 million; both reflecting the impact of higher raw material costs, causing the balances of each remaining on our year-end balance sheet to be higher compared to the prior year.

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 decreased $399 million compared to 2016 primarily due to a $440 million decrease in segment operating income. 

Cash used for working capital in 2017 was $106 million compared to $117 million in 2016. Cash used for working capital in 2017 reflects the impacts of higher raw materials on our costs and pricing, driving year-over-year increases in cash used for accounts receivable of $358 million and cash provided by accounts payable of $241 million. Cash used for inventory decreased $128 million during 2017 as the impacts of higher raw materials were more than offset by the impact of reduced production levels.

Investing Activities

Net cash used by investing activities was $867 million in 2018, compared to $879 million in 2017 and $979 million in 2016. Capital expenditures were $811 million in 2018, compared to $881 million in 2017 and $996 million in 2016. Beyond expenditures required to sustain our facilities, capital expenditures primarily related to the construction, expansion and modernization of manufacturing capacity in the United States, China, India and Thailand in 2018; the United States, Mexico, China and India in 2017; and the United States, Brazil, China and Mexico in 2016. 

Financing Activities

Net cash used by financing activities was $243 million, $415 million and $876 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Financing activities in 2018 and 2017 included net borrowings of $135 million and $129 million, respectively. Financing activities in 2016 included net debt repayments of $256 million. We repurchased $220 million, $400 million and $500 million of our common stock in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We paid dividends on our common stock of $138 million, $110 million and $82 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We do not expect to make a significant amount of share repurchases in 2019.

Credit Sources

In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $8,971 million available at December 31, 2018, of which $3,151 million were unused, compared to $8,963 million available at December 31, 2017, of which $3,196 million were unused. At December 31, 2018, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $8,212 million, of which $2,822 million were unused, compared to $8,346 million and $2,841 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $759 million, of which $329 million were unused, compared to $617 million and $355 

 38
million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time.

Outstanding Notes

At December 31, 2018, we had $3,314 million of outstanding notes, compared to $3,325 million at December 31, 2017. 

$2.0 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2021

Our amended and restated first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based primarily on (i) eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, (ii) the value of our principal trademarks, and (iii) certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $2.0 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2018, our borrowing base, and therefore our availability, under the facility was $330 million below the facility's stated amount of $2.0 billion. Based on our current liquidity, amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30 basis points.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no borrowings and $37 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. 

During 2016, we began entering into bilateral letter of credit agreements. At December 31, 2018, we had $343 million in letters of credit issued under these agreements.

Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2025

In March 2018, we amended and restated our second lien term loan facility. As a result of the amendment, the term loan, which previously matured on April 30, 2019, now matures on March 7, 2025. The term loan bears interest, at our option, at (i) 200 basis points over LIBOR or (ii) 100 basis points over an alternative base rate (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate plus 50 basis points or (c) LIBOR plus 100 basis points). In addition, if the Total Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 1.25 to 1.00, we have the option to further reduce the spreads described above by 25 basis points. "Total Leverage Ratio" has the meaning given it in the facility.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amounts outstanding under this facility were $400 million. 

€550 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2020

Our amended and restated €550 million European revolving credit facility consists of (i) a €125 million German tranche that is available only to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Germany GmbH (“GDTG”) and (ii) a €425 million all-borrower tranche that is available to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. ("GDTE"), GDTG and Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations S.A. Up to €150 million of swingline loans and €50 million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the all-borrower tranche. Amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points for loans denominated in U.S. dollars or pounds sterling and EURIBOR plus 175 basis points for loans denominated in euros, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30 basis points.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under the European revolving credit facility. 

Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since December 31, 2015 under the first lien facility and December 31, 2014 under the European facility. 

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On-Balance Sheet)

In September 2018, GDTE and certain other of our European subsidiaries amended and restated the definitive agreements for our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility, extending the term through 2023. The terms of the facility provide the flexibility to designate annually the maximum amount of funding available under the facility in an amount of not less than €30 million and not more than €450 million. For the period from October 16, 2017 to October 17, 2018, the designated maximum amount of the facility was €275 million. Effective October 18, 2018, the designated maximum amount of the facility was increased to €320 million.

The facility involves the ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. Utilization under this facility is based on eligible receivable balances.

 39
The funding commitments under the facility will expire upon the earliest to occur of: (a) September 26, 2023, (b) the non-renewal and expiration (without substitution) of all of the back-up liquidity commitments, (c) the early termination of the facility according to its terms (generally upon an Early Amortisation Event (as defined in the facility), which includes, among other things, events similar to the events of default under our senior secured credit facilities; certain tax law changes; or certain changes to law, regulation or accounting standards), or (d) our request for early termination of the facility. The facility’s current back-up liquidity commitments will expire on October 17, 2019. 

At December 31, 2018, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $335 million (€293 million). At December 31, 2017, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $224 million (€187 million). The program does not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in Long Term Debt and Capital Leases.

Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off-Balance Sheet)

We have sold certain of our trade receivables under off-balance sheet programs. For these programs, we have concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non-payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of receivables sold was $568 million and $572 million, respectively. 

Supplier Financing 

We have entered into payment processing agreements with several financial institutions. Under these agreements, the financial institution acts as our paying agent with respect to accounts payable due to our suppliers. These agreements also allow our suppliers to sell their receivables to the financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them. We are not always notified when our suppliers sell receivables under these programs. Our obligations to our suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by our suppliers' decisions to sell their receivables under the program. Agreements for such supplier financing programs totaled up to $500 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Further Information

For a further description of the terms of our outstanding notes, first lien revolving credit facility, second lien term loan facility, European revolving credit facility and pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.

Covenant Compliance

Our first and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. Our first and second lien credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes also have customary defaults, including cross-defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and its subsidiaries.

We have additional financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to use such cash proceeds to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0.

In addition, our European revolving credit facility contains non-financial covenants similar to the non-financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTE’s ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. 

 40
subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

Our credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test.

Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt.

As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures.

The terms “Available Cash,” “EBITDA,” “Consolidated Interest Expense,” “Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness,” “Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio,” “Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness” and “Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA” have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities.

Potential Future Financings

In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions that could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured.

Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt.

Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase Program

Under our primary credit facilities and some of our note indentures, we are permitted to pay dividends on and repurchase our capital stock (which constitute restricted payments) as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities or indentures following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016 we paid cash dividends of $138 million, $110 million and $82 million, respectively, on our common stock. On January 14, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) declared cash dividends of $0.16 per share of our common stock, or approximately $37 million in the aggregate. The cash dividend will be paid on March 1, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 1, 2019. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.

On September 18, 2013, the Board of Directors approved our common stock repurchase program. From time to time, the Board of Directors has approved increases in the amount authorized to be purchased under that program. On February 2, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a further increase in that authorization to $2.1 billion. This program expires on December 31, 2019, and is intended to be used, subject to our cash flow, to repurchase shares of common stock in open market transactions in order to offset new shares issued under equity compensation programs and to provide for additional shareholder returns. During 2018, we repurchased 8,936,302 shares at an average price, including commissions, of $24.62 per share, or $220 million in the aggregate. Since 2013, we repurchased 52,905,959 shares at an average price, including commissions, of $28.99 per share, or $1,534 million in the aggregate. We do not expect to make a significant amount of share repurchases in 2019.

The restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and indentures did not affect our ability to pay the dividends on or repurchase our capital stock as described above, and are not expected to affect our ability to pay similar dividends or make similar repurchases in the future.

Asset Dispositions

The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non-core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions.

 41
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Contractual Obligations

The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Debt obligations include Notes Payable and Overdrafts, and excludes the impact of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts.

(2)The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $61 million.

(3)These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt or future changes in variable interest rates.

(4)Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $15 million, $12 million, $8 million, $5 million, $3 million and $6 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $49 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,177 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $914 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party.

(5)The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2018. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table represent the mid-point of the range of our expected contributions for funded U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. 

We made significant contributions to fully fund our U.S. pension plans in 2013 and 2014. We have no minimum funding requirements for our funded U.S. pension plans under current ERISA law or the provisions of our USW collective bargaining agreement, which requires us to maintain an annual ERISA funded status for the hourly U.S. pension plan of at least 97%.

Future U.S. pension contributions will be affected by our ability to offset changes in future interest rates with asset returns from our fixed income portfolio and any changes to ERISA law. For further information on the U.S. pension investment strategy, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans. 

Future non-U.S. contributions are affected by factors such as:

•future interest rate levels,

•the amount and timing of asset returns, and

•how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amount and timing of future contributions.

(6)The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis.

(7)The payments for workers’ compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers’ compensation is $224 million.

 42
(8)Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2018.

(9)These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain income tax positions as of December 31, 2018. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters.

Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table.

In addition, pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers' production levels. These contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above.

We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has:

•made guarantees,

•retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets,

•undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or

•undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.

We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off-balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $73 million at December 31, 2018. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION — SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

Certain information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward-looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and “project,” as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including:

•if we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected;

•we face significant global competition and our market share could decline;

•deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets or third-party financing when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;

•raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition;

•if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected;

•our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;

•we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;

•our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results;

•financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business;

•our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner;

•we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health;
