Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Interest Rate Risk. We have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 3, 2019, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating rate debt principal was $2.1 billion, or approximately 8% of our long-term debt portfolio. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

The United Kingdomâ€™s Financial Conduct Authority has announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our floating rate notes, interest rate swap agreements, and credit instruments, which utilize LIBOR as a benchmark in determining the interest rate, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. As a result, we may incur incremental costs in transitioning to a new standard, and interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $8.8 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2018. Our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Commodity Price Risk. We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
