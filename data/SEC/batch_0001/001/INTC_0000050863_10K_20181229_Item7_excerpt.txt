MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A)

Five years ago, we set out a strategy to transform from a PC-centric to a data-centric company. Our 2018 results serve as a strong proof point that our strategy is working and our transformation is well underway. We achieved record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), driven by strong business performance, continued operating leverage, and a lower tax rate. Revenue from our data-centric businesses collectively increased by double digits. Our PC-centric business grew above our expectations and continued to be a source of profit, cash flow, scale, and intellectual property (IP). While we have had delays in implementing our 10 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process technology, we have continued to innovate in our 14nm products, introducing leadership products that deliver more value to our customers. We've expanded beyond PC and server businesses with significant growth in adjacent products, and gained share in an expanded $300 billion TAM1. Our employees are executing to our strategy by developing compelling technology and delivering innovative products to our customers, enabling strong financial growth. For key highlights of the results of our operations, see "A Year in Review" within Fundamentals of Our Business.

SEGMENT REVENUE WALK $B

2018 – 2017

In 2018, revenue was $70.8 billion, up $8.1 billion, or 13%, from 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our data-centric businesses, which collectively grew 18% year over year and made up nearly half of our total revenue in 2018. Our recently acquired Mobileye business had revenue of $698 million. Our PC-centric business grew 9%, above our expectations, due to PC TAM1 growth and demand for our leadership products. The increase in 2018 revenue was partially offset by the loss of revenue from businesses that were divested, specifically $534 million from the divestiture of the Intel Security Group (ISecG) and approximately $165 million from the divestiture of Wind River.

2017 – 2016

2017 revenue of $62.8 billion was up $3.4 billion, or 6%, from 2016. After adjusting for the Q2 2017 divestiture of ISecG, revenue grew 9% from 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong performance across our data-centric businesses, which collectively grew 16% year over year after adjusting for ISecG. We saw revenue growth across our DCG, IOTG, NSG, and PSG businesses, and 2017 revenue included $210 million from our Mobileye business. The increase in 2017 revenue was partially offset by $1.6 billion from the divestiture of ISecG and by approximately $500 million from a change to the Intel Inside® program.

MARKET AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Market trends and strategy

Data is a significant force in society today, and data is generated by intelligent and connected devices and infrastructures, such as phones and automated factories. Data is transmitted through network infrastructure, processed, and analyzed to become real-time information. This real-time information enables actionable insights and is the lifeblood for the future of technology innovation in areas such as AI. 

Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand to process, analyze, store, and move data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution, and we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these demands. We expect the growth momentum in DCG and the other data-centric businesses to continue in the long term. 

DCG focuses on three market segments: cloud service providers, enterprise and government, and communication service providers. In 2018, cloud revenue grew as service providers continued to invest in infrastructure to meet the explosive demand for digital services, AI, and data analytics. Enterprise and government revenue was stable, driven by macro environment strength and increased deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. Compared to 2017, where we saw workload migration as the main force of cloud growth, we now see new services as the primary drivers to public cloud demand while enterprise increased on-premises investments, including hybrid and private cloud deployments. In the communication service provider segment, we gained market segment share as customers chose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel® architecture. 

Products and competitiveness

We offer a broad portfolio of platforms and technologies designed to provide workload-optimized performance across compute, storage, and network. These offerings span the full spectrum from the data center core to the network edge. In addition, DCG focuses on lowering the total cost of ownership and on other specific workload optimizations for the enterprise, cloud service provider, and communications service provider market segments, with hardware-enhanced performance, security features, and reliability. DCG's platform value can be extended through Intel adjacent products such as FPGAs and SSDs.

In 2018, we began shipping for revenue the second generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors, formerly code-named Cascade Lake, and they will launch in 2019. The new product delivers performance improvement over the prior generation on popular workloads, includes hardware-based mitigations for certain side-channel vulnerabilities, and introduces new capabilities with support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory. The combination of Intel Xeon processors and Intel Optane memory significantly boosted overall system performance and reduced total cost of ownership compared to the prior generation.

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET

We recognized ongoing mark-to-market net losses on our marketable equity securities of $129 million in 2018, primarily related to changes in value of our interests in ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) and Cloudera, Inc. In addition to the mark-to-market losses, we also recognized impairment charges, including a $290 million impairment charge to our equity method investment in IMFT. These losses were partially offset by $202 million of upward observable price adjustments. 

We recognized $3.5 billion of net realized gains on sales in 2017, primarily related to sales of a portion of our interest in ASML. The higher net realized gains were partially offset by $833 million of impairment charges and our share of equity method investee losses in 2017. We recognized higher reported gains in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily related to sales of a portion of our interest in ASML. 

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

We recognized a net gain in interest and other in 2018 compared to a net loss in 2017, primarily due to lower losses on debt conversions, higher assets under construction resulting in more capitalized interest, and larger divestiture gains in 2018 compared to 2017. 

We recognized a lower net loss in interest and other in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher interest income in 2017.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from initial tax expense from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) and the tax impacts from the ISecG divestiture that we had in 2017, but not in 2018. The reduction of the U.S. statutory rate, combined with the net impact of the enactment or repeal of specific tax law provisions through the Tax Reform, drove the remaining decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018. For further information on Tax Reform and its impacts, see "Note 9: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Substantially all of the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by the one-time provisional impacts from the Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017, the 2017 ISecG divestiture, and a higher proportion of our income in higher tax rate jurisdictions.

 MD&A Consolidated Results and Analysis38
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include investments as shown in the preceding table. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 29, 2018, $480 million of commercial paper remained outstanding. During 2018, we remarketed a total of $423 million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. We also repaid $600 million of our 2.50% senior notes that matured in November 2018 and paid $2.4 billion in cash to satisfy conversion requests for a portion of our $2.0 billion 3.25% junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2039. 

The enactment of Tax Reform in December 2017 imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Future distributions of non-U.S. assets to the U.S. are no longer subject to U.S. taxation in most cases. As a result, in Q4 2017 we recognized a one-time provisional transition tax expense of $6.1 billion, which was adjusted to $5.9 billion in 2018. We expect to pay the tax in annual installments from 2019 through 2026. We believe that our current U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our tax liability. 

During Q3 2017, we acquired 97.3% of Mobileye's outstanding ordinary shares for $14.5 billion net cash. We funded the acquisition of shares with cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. During Q2 2018, we acquired the remaining outstanding ordinary shares for $380 million. 

We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, dividends, and common stock repurchases.

SOURCES AND USES OF CASH

(In Millions)

In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:

 MD&A Consolidated Results and Analysis40
OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

For 2018 compared to 2017, the $7.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income, offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes and accounts receivables, offset by relatively flat inventory levels. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2018 compared to 2017 were flat as the benefit of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate was offset by the payment related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform transition tax. We received $1.4 billion of customer deposits and prepaid supply agreements in 2018, net of customer utilization, compared to $1.1 billion in 2017. 

For 2017 compared to 2016, the $302 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes to working capital partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items and lower net income. Tax Reform did not have an impact on our 2017 cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased income before taxes and $1.1 billion receipts of customer deposits and prepaid supply agreements. These increases were partially offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2017 compared to 2016 were $2.9 billion higher due to higher income before taxes, taxable gains on sales of ASML, and taxes on the ISecG divestiture. 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $15.2 billion in 2018 ($11.8 billion in 2017 and $9.6 billion in 2016). 

The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower cash paid on acquisitions and increased cash from net trading asset activity. This was partially offset by increased capital expenditures, net available-for-sale debt investments activity, decreased proceeds from divestitures, and decreased sales of equity investments (substantially all from ASML sales). 

The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher net activity of available-for-sale debt investments in 2017, proceeds from our divestiture of ISecG in 2017, and higher maturities and sales of trading assets in 2017. This activity was partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2017.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.

The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to decreased long-term debt issuance and increased repurchases of common stock. During 2018, we repurchased $10.7 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $3.6 billion in 2017. In 2018, the Board approved a $15.0 billion increase in our authorized stock repurchase program. As of December 29, 2018, $17.3 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Our total dividend payments were $5.5 billion in 2018 compared to $5.1 billion in 2017. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 105 quarters. In Q1 2019, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.315 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2019 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2019.

The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to net long-term debt activity, which was a use of cash in 2017 compared to a source of cash in 2016. Additionally, cash used for common stock repurchases was higher in 2017 compared to 2016.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Significant contractual obligations as of December 29, 2018 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2018, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.

2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. 

3 Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see "Note 9: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.

4 Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.

5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, as they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.

6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.

The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.

For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Most of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 29, 2018, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $688 million.

For the majority of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.

 MD&A Consolidated Results and Analysis42
During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have agreed to invest up to $9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc), formally Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment, and the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.
