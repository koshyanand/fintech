Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). The Company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate, including real estate under development, and intangible assets and liabilities, valuation of joint venture investments and other investments, and realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. 

The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and other investments. The Company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments. 

Revenue Recognition and Recoverability of Trade Accounts Receivable 

The Company’s primary source of revenue is derived from property leases which produce the Company’s Revenues from rental properties, Reimbursement income and Other rental property income. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this standard did not result in any material changes to the Company’s revenue recognition (See Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K). 

Revenues from rental properties 

Revenues from rental properties are comprised of minimum base rent, percentage rent, lease termination fee income, amortization of above-market and below-market rent adjustments and straight-line rent adjustments. Base rental revenues from rental properties are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. Lease termination fee income is recognized when the lessee provides consideration in order to terminate an existing lease agreement and has vacated the leased space. The performance obligation of the Company is the termination of the lease agreement which occurs upon consideration received and execution of the termination agreement. Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of identified intangible assets and liabilities (including above-market and below-market leases, where applicable). The capitalized above-market or below-market intangible asset or liability is amortized to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases, which includes the expected renewal option period for below-market leases. 

Reimbursement income 

Leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance costs (“CAM”), real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned.

Trade accounts receivable 

The Company makes estimates of the uncollectable trade accounts receivables related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. The Company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of trade accounts receivable. 

Real Estate  

Depreciable Lives 

The Company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. 

The Company capitalizes acquisition costs related to real estate operating properties, which qualify as asset acquisitions. Also, upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Fair value is determined based on a market approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: 

  Buildings and building improvements (in years)     5 to 50   

  Fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements (including certain identified intangible assets)     Terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter    

The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company’s net earnings. 

Valuation of real estate, including real estate under development, and intangible assets and liabilities 

On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, general market conditions and delays of development, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows, net of anticipated construction and leasing costs, (undiscounted and unleveraged) of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future costs of materials and labor, operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates. 

When a real estate asset is identified by management as held-for-sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in management’s opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. 

Valuation of Joint Venture Investments and Other Investments 

The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the Company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. Earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and, where applicable, are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period. 

The Company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in open-air shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment, and, due to the lender’s exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. From time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt, which may be guaranteed by the joint venture. The Company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments.

Table of Contents  

On a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. 

The Company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates. 

Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Positions 

The Company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its TRS activities and subject to local taxes on certain non-U.S. investments. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. 

A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on the evidence available, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance, which requires significant judgement from management, should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance. 

The Company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions, which requires significant judgment from management. Although the Company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the Company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made, which could have a material impact on operating results (see Footnote 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K).

The Company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations. The convenience and availability of e-commerce has continued to have an impact on the retail sector, which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases and/or lease available space. To mitigate the effect of e-commerce on its business, the Company’s strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers, including grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants, which offer off-price merchandise and day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items. In addition, the Company’s strategy includes investing capital into high quality assets, which are concentrated in major metro markets, allowing our tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume while also disposing of lesser quality assets in less desirable locations. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” 

The Company continues to take steps to strengthen its portfolio in the rapidly changing retail environment. The Company intends to continue to dispose of assets outside its core markets, which will allow it to concentrate its presence in target coastal markets by completing development projects underway and continuing to invest in redevelopment, ultimately producing a stronger portfolio for sustained long-term growth.

Table of Contents  

The following describes the changes of certain line items included in Net income available to the Company’s common shareholders on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, which it believes represent items that have significant changes during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017: 

Revenue from rental properties – 

The decrease in Revenues from rental properties of $30.3 million is primarily from the combined effect of (i) a decrease in revenues of $63.2 million from properties sold during 2018 and 2017, partially offset by (ii) the completion of certain development/redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and net growth in the current portfolio, which provided incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $21.6 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017, and (iii) the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties during 2018 and 2017, which provided incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $11.3 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017. 

Real estate taxes – 

Real estate taxes decreased $3.9 million primarily due to (i) a decrease of $12.0 million resulting from properties sold during 2018 and 2017, partially offset by (ii) an overall net increase of $6.4 million primarily due to increases in property tax rates and assessments during 2018, as compared to 2017 and (iii) an increase of $1.7 million related to the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties during 2018 and 2017. 

Operating and maintenance – 

The decrease in Operating and maintenance of $5.3 million is primarily from the combined effect of (i) a decrease in operating costs of $9.4 million from properties sold during 2018 and 2017, partially offset by (ii) an increase of $2.5 million related to the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties and (iii) an increase of $1.6 million primarily related to snow removal costs. 

General and administrative – 

The decrease in General and administrative costs of $3.9 million is primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs and consulting fees. 

Impairment charges –  

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $79.2 million and $67.3 million, respectively, for which the Company’s estimated fair values were primarily based upon (i) signed contracts or letters of intent from third party offers, (ii) discounted cash flow models or (iii) third party appraisal. These adjustments to property carrying values were recognized in connection with the Company’s efforts to market certain properties, including a property which the Company discontinued its plan to develop and now intends to market it for sale as is, and management’s assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential transactions. Certain of the calculations to determine fair value utilized unobservable inputs and as such are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For additional disclosure, see Footnotes 6 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 

Depreciation and amortization –  

The decrease in Depreciation and amortization of $50.4 million is primarily due to (i) a decrease of $29.1 million related to the acceleration of depreciable lives of assets due to demolition within the Company’s redevelopment projects during 2017, as compared to 2018, (ii) a decrease of $15.6 million resulting from property dispositions in 2018 and 2017 and (iii) a decrease related to tenant vacates and write-offs of depreciable assets of $14.5 million, partially offset by (iv) an increase of $8.8 million related to the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties during 2017. 

Gain on sale of operating properties/change in control of interests-  

During 2018, the Company disposed of 54 operating properties (including the deconsolidation of one property) and seven out-parcels, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $1.2 billion. These transactions resulted in aggregate gains of $229.8 million and aggregate impairment charges of $19.7 million. During 2017, the Company disposed of 25 operating properties and nine parcels, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $352.2 million. These transactions resulted in aggregate gains of $93.5 million and aggregate impairment charges of $17.1 million. 

25 

Table of Contents  

Other income, net –  

The increase in Other income, net of $10.5 million is primarily due to (i) the recognition of gain on forgiveness of debt of $4.3 million and relief of accrued interest expense of $3.4 million resulting from the foreclosure of an encumbered property during 2018, (ii) the recognition of $4.2 million in income resulting from the receipt of casualty insurance claims in excess of the value of the assets written off, (iii) a reduction in demolition related costs of $3.5 million and (iv) an increase in gains on land sales of $2.9 million, partially offset by (v) the recognition of a net loss on changes in fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities of $3.5 million during 2018 and (vi) an increase in deal costs of $3.2 million related to transactions the Company is no longer pursuing. 

Interest expense –  

The decrease in Interest expense of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017, is primarily the result of the repayment of maturing debt during 2018 and 2017 and lower levels of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017. 

Early extinguishment of debt charges – 

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred early extinguishment of debt charges of $12.8 million in connection with the optional make-whole provisions of unsecured notes that were repaid prior to maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred early extinguishment of debt charges of $1.8 million in connection with the tender premium on Medium Term Notes that were partially tendered prior to maturity. 

Equity in income of joint ventures, net –  

The increase in Equity in income of joint ventures, net of $10.9 million is primarily due to (i) an increase in net gains of $13.8 million resulting from the sales of properties and ownership interests within various joint venture investments during 2018 as compared to 2017 and (ii) the recognition during 2017 of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $4.8 million as a result of the substantial liquidation of the Company’s investments in Canada, partially offset by (iii) lower equity in income of $5.6 million primarily resulting from the sales of properties within various joint venture investments and the acquisition of partnership interests in joint ventures by the Company during 2018 and 2017 and (iv) an increase in impairment charges of $2.1 million recognized during 2018 as compared to 2017. 

Gain on change in control of joint venture interests –  

During 2017, the Company acquired, in separate transactions, a controlling interest in three operating properties from certain joint venture partners in which the Company had noncontrolling interests. As a result of these transactions, the Company recorded an aggregate gain on change in control of interests of $71.2 million related to the fair value adjustment associated with its previously held equity interest in these operating properties. 

Equity in income from other real estate investments, net –  

The decrease in Equity in income from other real estate investments, net of $37.9 million is primarily due to (i) a decrease of $34.6 million in equity in income from the Albertsons joint venture resulting from cash distributions received in excess of the Company’s carrying basis during 2017 and (ii) the recognition in 2017 of a cumulative foreign currency translation gain of $14.8 million as a result of the substantial liquidation of the Company’s investments in Canada during 2017, partially offset by (iii) an increase in earnings and profit participation from capital transactions related to Company’s Preferred Equity Program of $11.4 million during 2018, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017. 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests –  

The decrease in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $12.9 million is primarily due to equity in income allocated to the Company’s noncontrolling interest members as a result of a distribution in excess of basis in the Albertsons joint venture during 2017. 

Preferred stock redemption charges –  

During 2017, the Company partially redeemed its Class I Preferred Stock shares, and as a result, the Company recorded a redemption charge of $7.0 million. This $7.0 million charge was subtracted from net income attributable to the Company to arrive at net income available to the Company’s common shareholders and used in the calculation of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

26 

Table of Contents  

Preferred dividends –  

The increase in Preferred dividends of $11.6 million is primarily due to the issuances of Class L Preferred Stock and Class M Preferred Stock in 2017 and 2018, partially offset by the partial redemption of Class I Preferred Stock in 2017.

Revenue from rental properties – 

The increase in Revenues from rental properties of $19.3 million is primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties during 2017 and 2016, which provided incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $43.5 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, and (ii) the completion of certain redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and net growth in the current portfolio, which provided incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $0.4 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of $24.6 million from properties sold during 2017 and 2016.

The Company continually evaluates its debt maturities, and, based on management’s current assessment, believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results. The Company continues to pursue borrowing opportunities with large commercial U.S. and global banks, select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks. The Company has noticed a continuing trend that, although pricing remains dependent on specific deal terms, generally spreads for non-recourse mortgage financing has stabilized and the unsecured debt markets are functioning well and credit spreads are at manageable levels. 

Debt maturities for 2019 consist of: $45.6 million of unconsolidated joint venture debt and $26.3 million of debt included in the Company’s Preferred Equity Program, assuming the utilization of extension options where available. These debt maturities are anticipated to be repaid through operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate. 

The Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintain its investment-grade senior, unsecured debt ratings. The Company may, from time-to-time, seek to obtain funds through additional common and preferred equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives. 

Since the completion of the Company’s IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $13.8 billion. Proceeds from public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in open-air shopping centers, funding real estate under development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had over 325 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. 

Dividends – 

In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. The Company’s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company’s dividend policy on a quarterly basis as the Board of Directors monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid were $529.8 million, $506.2 million and $474.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. On October 23, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share payable to shareholders of record on January 2, 2019, which was paid on January 15, 2019.

All dividends on the preferred shares are scheduled to be paid on April 15, 2019, to shareholders of record on April 1, 2019. 

Hurricane Impacts – 

The Company incurred no significant damage to its properties in September 2018 as a result of Hurricanes Florence, which primarily hit North and South Carolina, and Michael, which hit the Florida Panhandle. 

On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane which resulted in widespread damage, flooding, and power outages. The Company has interests in seven operating properties located throughout Puerto Rico, aggregating 2.2 million square feet of GLA, which were variously impacted by the hurricane. The Company maintains a comprehensive property insurance policy on these properties with total coverage of up to $62.0 million, as well as business interruption insurance with coverage up to $39.3 million in the aggregate, subject to a collective deductible of $1.2 million. 

The Company expects to collect property insurance proceeds (net of deductible) equal to the replacement cost of its damaged property, currently estimated to be approximately $30.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has collected property insurance proceeds totaling $20.2 million to date, which exceeds the $16.0 million previously written off due to property damage by $4.2 million. As a result, the Company recognized this excess as income included in Other income, net on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Table of Contents  

 The Company’s business interruption insurance covers lost revenues as a result of the hurricane for a period of up to one year. After the expiration of one year following the loss, the policy has 365 days of an extended period of indemnity which provides business interruption coverage in the event the properties have not fully recovered from the storm. During 2018 and 2017, the Company collected business interruption claims totaling $2.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from its insurance provider. Although the Company has primarily recovered its business interruption insurance claims, it will continue to assess and process any future business interruption claims for the extended period of indemnity and will submit insurance claims for its losses, if any, under its business interruption insurance policy. 

Income Taxes – 

The Company is subject to taxes on its activities in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. In general, under local country law applicable to the structures the Company has in place and applicable treaties, the repatriation of cash to the Company from its subsidiaries and joint ventures in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico generally are not subject to withholding tax. The Company is subject to and also includes in its tax provision non-U.S. income taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. These investments are held by the Company at the REIT level and not in the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company does not expect a U.S. income tax impact associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. 

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 

The Company has debt obligations relating to its Credit Facility, unsecured senior notes and mortgages with maturities ranging from one year to 29 years. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of 10.5 years. In addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 31 consolidated shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt maturities (excluding extension options, unamortized debt issuance costs of $55.9 million and fair market value of debt adjustments aggregating $13.1 million) and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018:

Maturities utilized do not reflect extension options, which range from six months to one year.    

(2)   

For loans which have interest at floating rates, future interest expense was calculated using the rate as of December 31, 2018.    

(3)   

For leases which have inflationary increases, future ground rent expense was calculated using the rent based upon initial lease payment.    

The Company has no secured debt scheduled to mature in 2019. The Company anticipates satisfying the remaining future maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its Credit Facility, exercise of extension options, where available, and new debt issuances. 

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for loans encumbering certain of the Company’s development and redevelopment projects and guarantee of payment related to the Company’s insurance program. As of December 31, 2018, these letters of credit aggregated $41.8 million. 

In connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the Company’s obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $20.6 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding. 

The Company has accrued $2.8 million of non-current uncertain tax positions and related interest under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for income taxes, which are included in Other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018. These amounts are not included in the table above because a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with the relevant tax authorities, if any, cannot be made.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures 

The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These joint ventures primarily operate shopping center properties. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the Company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders’ sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see Footnote 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K). The table below presents debt balances within the Company’s unconsolidated joint venture investments for which the Company held noncontrolling ownership interests at December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions): 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* Average remaining term includes extensions 

(1)   

Includes an unsecured term loan of $200.0 million (excluding deferred financing costs of $0.3 million), which is scheduled to mature in August 2019, with two one-year extension options at the joint venture’s discretion, and bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75% (4.18% at December 31, 2018).    

(2)   

Includes an unsecured revolving credit facility with an outstanding balance at December 31, 2018 of $73.3 million (excluding deferred financing costs of $0.3 million), which is scheduled to mature in September 2020, with two one-year extension options at the joint venture’s discretion, and bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75% (4.18% at December 31, 2018).    

As of December 31, 2018, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from one month to 13 years and bore interest at rates ranging from 2.91% to 7.25%. Approximately $45.6 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balance matures in 2019. These maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see Footnote 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K). 

Other Real Estate Investments 

The Company previously provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties through its Preferred Equity Program. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s net investment under the Preferred Equity Program was $176.3 million relating to 285 properties, including 273 net leased properties. As of December 31, 2018, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $298.9 million (excluding fair market value of debt adjustments aggregating $15.1 million). These loans have scheduled maturities ranging from six months to six years and bear interest at rates ranging from 4.19% to 10.47%. Due to the Company’s preferred position in these investments, the Company’s share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Company’s maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital. 

Funds From Operations 

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as net income/(loss) available to the Company’s common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iv) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 

The Company presents FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

The Company also presents FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as adjusted is generally calculated by the Company as FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the Company’s operating real estate portfolio.

FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. Our method of calculating FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders and FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as adjusted may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 

The Company’s reconciliation of net income available to the Company’s common shareholders to FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders and FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as adjusted for the three months and years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1)   Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period, which would have a dilutive effect on FFO. FFO would be increased by $228 and $274 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $916 and $923 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effect of other certain convertible units would have an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations.    

  (2)   Related to gains, impairment and deprecation on depreciable real estate properties, where applicable.    

  (3)   Related to transaction (income)/expense, where applicable.

Same Property Net Operating Income (“Same property NOI”) 

Same property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company considers Same property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the Company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate. Same property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties. 

Same property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for bad debt, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the Company’s proportionate share of Same property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The Company’s method of calculating Same property NOI available to the Company’s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 

The following is a reconciliation of Net income available to the Company’s common shareholders to Same property NOI (in thousands): 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Same property NOI increased by $5.3 million or 2.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase of $5.6 million related to lease-up and rent commencements in the portfolio, partially offset by (ii) an increase of $0.2 million of credit losses and (iii) a decrease in other property income of $0.1 million. 

Same property NOI increased by $23.7 million or 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase of $24.6 million related to lease-up and rent commencements in the portfolio, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in other property income of $0.5 million and (iii) an increase of $0.4 million of credit losses. 

Effects of Inflation 

Many of the Company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
