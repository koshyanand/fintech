Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As of March 31, 2019, our long-term debt totaled $11.66 billion. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $6.48 billion as of March 31, 2019. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $5.18 billion balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of March 31, 2019. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $26.0 million.
