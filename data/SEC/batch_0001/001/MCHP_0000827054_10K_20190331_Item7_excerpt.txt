Introduction

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including "Item 1 – Business;" "Item 6 – Selected Financial Data;" and "Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

We begin our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products. This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then discuss our Results of Operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, and for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. We then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Contractual Obligations" and "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements."

Acquisition of Microsemi

On May 29, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Microsemi Corporation, a publicly traded company headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California. We paid an aggregate of approximately $8.19 billion in cash to the stockholders of Microsemi. The total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $53.9 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of Microsemi for stock awards of Microchip, was approximately $8.24 billion. In addition to the consideration transferred, we recognized in our consolidated financial statements $3.23 billion in liabilities of Microsemi consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, pension obligations, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities of which $2.06 billion of existing debt was paid off. We financed the purchase price using approximately $8.10 billion of borrowings consisting of $3.10 billion of loans under our revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), $3.00 billion of term loans ("Term Loan Facility") provided under our amended and restated Credit Agreement, and $2.00 billion in newly issued senior secured notes. We incurred $22.0 million in costs related to the acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, Microsemi became a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip. Microsemi offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and system solutions for aerospace and defense, communications, data center and industrial markets. Our primary reason for this acquisition was to expand our range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending our served available market.

For further details, see the discussion in Note 2 of our financial statements included in this report. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls

As discussed in Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” in this report on Form 10-K, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to IT system access. Internal controls related to such matters are important to accurately reflect our financial position and results of operations in our financial reports. We are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses, but our efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in an appropriate and timely manner, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and consequently, our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt agreements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets. For additional information, refer to Item 9A "Controls and Procedures."

IT System Compromise

We have learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers. We have engaged experienced legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters. We have taken steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and, as of the date of this filing, we are implementing a containment plan. We are continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment plan and the amount and content of the information that was compromised and to implement additional remedial actions. At this time, we do not believe that this IT system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us. However, we are still evaluating the amount and type of data that was compromised and there can be no assurance as to what the impact of this IT system compromise will be. As described above, in connection with the IT system compromise, our management has concluded that we have a material weakness in our internal controls.

Strategy

Our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications. Our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions, including general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, 32-bit microprocessors, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) products, a broad spectrum of high-performance linear, mixed-signal, power management, thermal management, discrete diodes and MOSFETS, radio frequency (RF), timing, timing systems, safety, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity devices, as well as Serial Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), Serial Flash memories, Parallel Flash memories, Serial Electrically Erasable Random Access Memory (EERAM) and Serial Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). We also license Flash-IP solutions that are incorporated in a broad range of products. We provide highly cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed signal integration and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products. We license our SuperFlash technology and other technologies to wafer 

35
foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products, gate array, radio frequency (RF) and analog products that require embedded non-volatile memory.

We sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries. The principal markets that we serve include consumer, automotive, industrial, aerospace, office communication, and computing. Our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets. 

Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe and assembly and test. The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry. By owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields. Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles. This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin. We do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties. Our acquisition of Microsemi significantly increased the amount of our outsourced manufacturing requirements. 

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products. We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs. While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products. This allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly. Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently. 

We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. Our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, FPGAs, timing systems, Flash-IP, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries. We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products. 

We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. Our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. We currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in North America, Europe and Asia. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. Many of our client engagement managers (CEMs), embedded system engineers (ESEs), and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment. We believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for CEMs and distributor sales teams. ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world, and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.

See "Our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry," on page 16 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, share-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, senior and junior subordinated 

36
convertible debt and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. We review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition (subsequent to our adoption of ASU 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on April 1, 2018)

We generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and non-distributor customers (direct customers) and, to a lesser extent, from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property. We apply the following five-step approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.

Sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement, a purchase order, and an order acknowledgment. Sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract, as defined by ASC 606, until the distributor has sent in a purchase order, we have acknowledged the order, we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable, and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created; this generally occurs 30 days prior to the estimated ship date. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors. As these are forms of variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method. Usually, there is only a single performance obligation in the contract, and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. After the transaction price has been allocated, we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor.

Sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment. Sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract, as defined by ASC 606, until shipment of the product occurs. Generally, the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable. Usually, there is only a single performance obligation in the contract, and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. After the transaction price has been allocated, we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer.

Revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements. Our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property. The final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty, which is fixed in the licensing agreement. Revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs. 

Revenue Recognition - Distributors (prior to our adoption of ASC 606 on April 1, 2018)

Our distributors worldwide generally had broad price protection and product return rights which prevented the sales pricing from being fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to our distributors. Therefore, revenue recognition was deferred until the pricing uncertainty was resolved, which generally occurred when the distributor sold the product to their customer. At the time of shipment to these distributors, we recorded a trade receivable for the selling price as there was a legally enforceable right to payment, relieved inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title had passed to the distributor, and recorded the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represented the gross margin on the sale to the distributor; however, the amount of gross margin that we recognized in the subsequent periods was less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions.

We sold the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price. However, distributors resold our products to end customers at a broad range of individually negotiated price points. The majority of our distributors' resales required a reduction from the original list price paid. Often, under these circumstances, we remitted back to 

37
the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction was completed in the form of a credit against the distributors' outstanding accounts receivable balance. The credits were on a per unit basis and were not given to the distributor until they provided information to us regarding the sale to their end customer. The price reductions varied significantly based on the customer, product, quantity ordered, geographic location and other factors. Discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare. The effect of granting these credits established the net selling price to our distributors for the product and resulted in the net revenue recognized by us when the product was sold by the distributors to their end customers. Thus, a portion of the "deferred income on shipments to distributors" balance represented the amount of distributors' original purchase price that was credited back to the distributors in the subsequent periods. We did not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated concessions; rather, price concessions were typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred, which was generally at the time the distributor sold the product. At March 31, 2018, we had approximately $479.6 million of deferred revenue and $145.8 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as $333.8 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that was ultimately recognized in our income statement was lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet at March 31, 2018 due to additional price credits that were granted to the distributors when the product was sold to their customers. These additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognized in the distribution channel of our business.

Distributor advances, reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $203.9 million at March 31, 2018. On sales to distributors, our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost. The sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant. It is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases, requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances, on a current basis, generally within 30 days, for amounts originally invoiced. This practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors. As such, we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors' working capital requirements. These advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage. Such advances had no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income. We processed discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors' balance and true-up the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter. The terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured, bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand. The agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time.

We reduced product pricing through price protection based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other factors. Price protection was granted to distributors on the inventory they had on hand at the date the price protection was offered. When we reduced the price of our products, it allowed the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it had on hand as of the date of the price reduction. There was no immediate revenue impact from the price protection, as it was reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors' balance.

Products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations. We routinely evaluated the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account. Because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped, and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor resulted in a price less than our cost, we believe the deferred costs were recorded at their approximate carrying value.

Business Combinations

All of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, (i) acquisition-related costs, except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities, will be expensed in the period incurred; (ii) non-controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; (iii) in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility; (iv) restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and (v) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense. The measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment. The valuation of intangible assets, in particular, requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: revenue, expenses, capital spending and other costs, and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows. Under the 

38
acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. On an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment and through March 31, 2019, we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance. 

Share-based Compensation

We measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and employee stock purchase rights, to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values. For the past several years, we have utilized RSUs as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees. Share-based compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. Total share-based compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2019 was $166.4 million, of which $151.5 million was reflected in operating expenses and $14.9 million was reflected in cost of sales. Total share-based compensation included in our inventory balance was $12.4 million at March 31, 2019. 

During the year ended March 31, 2017, we elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). Under this standard, entities are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on share-based payment awards, as previously required, or to recognize forfeitures as they occur. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we estimated the number of share-based awards to be forfeited due to employee turnover.

If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense. Future share-based compensation expense and unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable. In estimating our inventory obsolescence, we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12-month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month demand. Estimates for projected 12-month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior three-month period, which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business. The estimated 12-month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12-month demand estimate. Management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations. For example, demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand. Alternatively, demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued. 

In periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity, the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales. As a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities, approximately $19.0 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2019. There was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. We provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets, where it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of such assets, will not be realized. 

39
Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. During the year ended March 31, 2019, various foreign jurisdictions finalized their audits. The close of these audits did not have an adverse impact on our financial statements. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 

The accounting model as defined in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions. The recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue. We will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period. All adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement. Generally, adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model, amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model.

On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law. The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the Act began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018, while other provisions have become effective for us in fiscal 2019.

In addition to the impacts of tax reform on fiscal 2018, the Act also establishes new tax laws that are effective for fiscal 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) a new provision designed to tax low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries ("GILTI"), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ("FTCs") and a deduction of up to 50% to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (2) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (3) limitations on the deductibility of interest expense; and (4) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability. While each of these provisions is expected to have an impact on our tax expense in future periods, the increase in tax expense for GILTI is the most significant.

Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) allows taxpayers to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on GILTI inclusions as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years. We are making a policy choice to include taxes due on the future GILTI inclusion in taxable income when incurred.

Senior and Junior Subordinated Convertible Debt

We separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. This results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Lastly, we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met. We apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash. This method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future.

40
Contingencies

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims and other matters. Additionally, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant. Consequently, we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions. We also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs. With respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims, although the outcomes are generally not determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Litigation and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and we are, from time to time, subject to such litigation and disputes. As a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation or disputes in the future.

We accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. Contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable, which generally is based on a probability weighted model. If fair value is not determinable, contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable.

Results of Continuing Operations

The following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Sales

We operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies. We sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers, referred to as OEMs, in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral. In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit.

The following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due primarily to our acquisition of Microsemi and was partially offset by our adoption of ASC 606 and demand fluctuations in the markets we serve. Revenue earned from Microsemi products accounted for a 39.4% increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was partially offset by our adoption of ASC 606 on April 1, 2018, which affected the timing of revenue recognition with our distributors as 

41
discussed further in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this Form 10-K on page 36. To a lesser extent than the adoption of ASC 606, net sales and demand were also negatively impacted by general economic conditions, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and, excluding the impacts of our Microsemi acquisition and the adoption of ASC 606, there was not any product, customer or market that accounted for a material portion of the change. The overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period. The overall average selling price of our products increased significantly during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose average selling price is higher than the average selling price of our historical business due to the types of products they offer and the types of customers and markets they serve.

The increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was impacted by the following two accounting factors, which occurred in fiscal 2017:

•an amount of revenue that could not be recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States relating to Atmel's inventory in the distribution channel on the acquisition date; and

•the impact of the change in timing of revenue recognition for some of Atmel's distributors from shipment to the distributor to upon sale by the distributor to their customers.

Excluding the impact of the two accounting factors described above, net sales for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 increased 14.0%. This increase was primarily due to growth in our business driven by favorable economic and semiconductor industry conditions. Approximately 6% of the increase in net sales during this period was due to increases in the overall average selling price of products sold as a result of favorable market conditions and product and geographic mix. The remaining sales growth was primarily due to a net increase in the volume of products sold. We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any product, customer or market that accounted for a material portion of the increase. The overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period.

As discussed in the following paragraphs, there were revenue increases across many of our product lines. Key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include:

•our acquisition of Microsemi, which closed on May 29, 2018;

•our acquisition of Atmel, which closed on April 4, 2016;

•global economic conditions in the markets we serve;

•trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;

•semiconductor industry conditions;

•adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) on April 1, 2018;

•our new product offerings that have increased our served available market;

•customers' increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions;

•inventory holding patterns of our customers, including distributors;

•increasing semiconductor content in our customers' products; and

•continued market share gains in the segments of the markets we address.

Net sales by product line for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

42
Microcontrollers

Our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales. Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 54.6%, 65.9% and 63.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose microcontroller product line accounted for a relatively low percentage of its total net sales.

Net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 11.6% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, and increased approximately 22.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from our acquisition of Microsemi. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains.

Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. The overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results. The average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period.

Analog, Interface, Mixed Signal and Timing Products

Sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 28.6%, 23.9% and 26.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose analog, interface, mixed signal and timing product line accounted for a relatively high percentage of its total net sales.

Net sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products increased approximately 60.8% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and increased approximately 7.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from our acquisition of Microsemi. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains. Additionally, some new analog products, which are integrated with a microcontroller core, are classified as microcontrollers, rather than analog. This classification adversely impacted some of the increases in net sales of analog products during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.

Analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or non-proprietary in nature. Currently, we consider a majority of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products. We may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results. We anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products will increase over time. 

Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Products

Our FPGA product line was primarily acquired as part of our acquisition of Microsemi on May 29, 2018. Sales of our FPGA products accounted for approximately 5.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2019.

FPGA product pricing has historically been relatively stable because they are proprietary products with significant design in complexity and they are frequently designed into long-lived end applications.

43
Memory Products

Sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 3.4%, 5.0%, and 5.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose product portfolio did not include memory products.

Net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 7.9% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, and increased approximately 8.5% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in memory product net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from customer demand conditions. The increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. 

Memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature, with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability, driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products. We may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Technology Licensing

Technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, and fees for engineering services. Technology licensing accounted for approximately 2.5%, 2.6% and 2.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net sales related to our technology licensing increased approximately 26.3% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and increased approximately 14.9% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees, the sale of patents and other intellectual property, and general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. 

Multi-market and Other

 Multi-market and Other (MMO) consists of manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and products for aerospace applications. Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 5.2%, 2.6% and 2.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net sales related to these services and products increased approximately $171.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and increased approximately $8.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in MMO net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from our acquisition of Microsemi, which significantly increased our portfolio of timing systems products. The increase in MMO net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions. MMO net sales can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).

Distribution

Distributors accounted for approximately 51% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, approximately 54% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and approximately 55% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. The decrease in this percentage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose distributors accounted for a smaller portion of net sales than Microchip's historical business. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 10% of our net sales, no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel. 

Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.

44
At March 31, 2019, our distributors maintained 35 days of inventory of our products compared to 36 days at March 31, 2018 and 33 days at March 31, 2017. Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days. Prior to our adoption of ASC 606 on April 1, 2018, we did not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors materially impacted our net sales due to the fact that we recognized revenue based on when the distributor sells the product to their customer. Upon our adoption of ASC 606 commencing on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue from distributors at the time our products are sold to the distributor. As a result, beginning April 1, 2018, inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales.

Sales by Geography

Sales by geography for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Americas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 80%, 85% and 84% of our total net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Sales to customers in Asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to Asia and growth in demand from the emerging Asian market; however, sales to Asia as a percentage of our total net sales decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, whose sales to customers in Asia accounted for a smaller portion of their total net sales than Microchip's historical business, and to a lesser extent, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. Sales to customers in the Americas increased as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which had more concentration in the aerospace and defense industry in the Americas. Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia.

Sales to customers in China accounted for approximately 22%, 30% and 32% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales to customers in Taiwan accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 9% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. In fiscal 2019, our acquisition of Microsemi and our transition to sell-in revenue recognition contributed to the changes in net sales by country. Our transition from sell-through revenue recognition to sell-in revenue recognition contributed to the changes in net sales by country because under sell-through revenue recognition we assigned revenue to the country of our distributor's end customer and under sell-in revenue recognition we assigned revenue to the country of our distributor. For additional information on our transition from sell-through to sell-in revenue recognition, refer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements.

Gross Profit

Our gross profit was $2,931.3 million in fiscal 2019, $2,420.7 million in fiscal 2018 and $1,757.2 million in fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 54.8% in fiscal 2019, 60.8% in fiscal 2018 and 51.6% in fiscal 2017. 

The most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this Form 10-K were:

•charges of approximately $365.7 million in fiscal 2019 and approximately $186.7 million in fiscal 2017 related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisitions which increased the value of our acquired inventory and subsequently increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was recognized;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•for fiscal 2018, inventory write-downs being lower than the gross margin impact of sales of inventory that was previously written down; 

•unabsorbed capacity charges due to operating at below normal capacity in fiscal 2019; and

•fluctuations in the product mix of microcontrollers, analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products, FPGA products, memory products and technology licensing.

45
Other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this Form 10-K include:

•continual cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing, such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques;

•lower depreciation as a percentage of cost of sales; and

•economic market conditions and product mix.

We adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industry-related conditions. When production levels are below normal capacity, which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment, we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity. In fiscal 2019, we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in an unabsorbed capacity charge of $19.0 million. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated at normal capacity levels.

The process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins. Our wafer fabrication facility located in Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly utilizes our 0.5 micron to 1.0 micron processes. Our wafer fabrication facility located in Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4) predominantly utilizes our 0.13 micron to 0.5 micron processes. We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs. All of our production in Fab 2 and Fab 4 has been on 8-inch wafers during the periods covered by this report. We consider normal capacity at Fab 2 and Fab 4 to be 90% to 95%. Our wafer fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado (Fab 5) currently utilizes processes between 0.25 micron and 1.0 micron that run on 6-inch wafers. We consider normal capacity at Fab 5 to be 70% to 75%. As a result of our acquisition of Micrel in August 2015, we acquired a 6-inch wafer fabrication facility in San Jose, California and have since transitioned products previously manufactured at this facility to our Fab 2, Fab 4 and Fab 5 facilities. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we decommissioned this San Jose facility and, in June 2017, we completed the sale of these assets for proceeds of $10.0 million. 

Our overall inventory levels were $711.7 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $476.2 million at March 31, 2018 and $417.2 million at March 31, 2017. Our overall inventory levels increased since March 31, 2018 because of our acquisition of Microsemi, which had $150.8 million of inventory as of March 31, 2019. We maintained 128 days of inventory on our balance sheet at March 31, 2019 compared to 112 days of inventory at March 31, 2018 and 103 days at March 31, 2017. We expect our days of inventory levels in the June 2019 quarter to be down 8 days to up 11 days compared to the March 2019 levels. We believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers.

We anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products, FPGA products, memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve.

We operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand, the Philippines, and other locations throughout the world. During fiscal 2019, approximately 38% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities, compared to approximately 42% during fiscal 2018 and approximately 36% during fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2019, approximately 49% of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities compared to approximately 64% during fiscal 2018 and approximately 60% during fiscal 2017. Third-party contractors located primarily in Asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations. The percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities.

The decreases in the percentages of assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 were primarily due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which outsources the majority of its assembly and test requirements. The increases in the percentages of assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 were primarily due to investments in assembly and test equipment, which increased our internal capacity capabilities. We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. We plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.

We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. During fiscal 2019, approximately 57% of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 42% during fiscal 2018 and approximately 41% during fiscal 2017. The increases were primarily due to our acquisition of Microsemi, which outsources the majority of its wafer fabrication requirements.

46
Our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract. While we review the quality, delivery and cost performance of our third-party contractors, our future operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels.

Research and Development (R&D)

R&D expenses for fiscal 2019 were $826.3 million, or 15.4% of sales, compared to $529.3 million, or 13.3% of sales, for fiscal 2018 and $545.3 million, or 16.0% of sales, for fiscal 2017. We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives. R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments. 

R&D expenses increased $297.0 million, or 56.1%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of Microsemi. R&D expenses decreased $16.0 million, or 2.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our Atmel acquisition and lower share-based compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated Atmel employees during fiscal 2017. 

R&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 were $682.9 million, or 12.8% of sales, compared to $452.1 million, or 11.4% of sales, for fiscal 2018, and $499.8 million, or 14.7% of sales, for fiscal 2017. Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses as our revenue increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $230.8 million, or 51.1%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of Microsemi, including approximately $41.7 million of acquisition-related legal and professional service expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $47.7 million, or 9.5%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our Atmel acquisition and lower share-based compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated Atmel employees during fiscal 2017.

Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets

Amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2019 was $674.1 million compared to $485.5 million in fiscal 2018 and $337.7 million in fiscal 2017. The primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was our acquisition of Microsemi. The primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was amortization of in-process R&D assets from our acquisition of Atmel.

Special Charges and Other, Net 

During fiscal 2019, we incurred special charges and other, net of $33.7 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of $63.9 million, offset by $30.2 million in legal contingencies. Our restructuring expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were related to our most recent business acquisitions, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations. During fiscal 2018, we incurred special charges and other, net of $17.5 million comprised primarily of a $19.5 million charge for fees associated with transitioning from a public utility provider in Oregon to a lower cost direct access provider. During fiscal 2017, we 

47
incurred special charges and other, net of $98.6 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges. These restructuring charges included employee separation costs, contract exit costs, other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after our acquisition of Atmel that affected the use and life of these assets.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest income in fiscal 2019 was $8.1 million compared to $22.0 million in fiscal 2018 and $3.1 million in fiscal 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 relates to lower average cash and investment balances as we used a substantial portion of our cash to help finance the purchase price of our acquisition of Microsemi. The primary reason for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to higher cash and investment balances.

Interest expense in fiscal 2019 was $502.9 million compared to $199.0 million in fiscal 2018 and $146.3 million in fiscal 2017. The primary reason for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 relates to our additional borrowings to help finance our acquisition of Microsemi. The primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to our issuance of $2,645.0 million of convertible notes in February 2017 partially offset by lower interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility.

Loss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2019 was $12.6 million compared to $16.0 million in fiscal 2018 and $43.9 million in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2019, we recognized a loss of $12.6 million primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our Term Loan Facility. In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we settled $143.8 million and $431.3 million, respectively, in principal of our 2007 Junior Subordinated Convertible Debt (2007 Junior Debt). Total conversions for fiscal 2018 were for a principal amount of $32.5 million for which we settled the principal amount in cash and issued 0.5 million shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversions occurring prior to the call notice and $41.0 million in cash for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversion requests received after the call notice. In June 2017, we exchanged in privately negotiated transactions $111.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 2007 Junior Debt for (i) $111.3 million principal amount of our 2017 Junior Subordinated Convertible Debt (2017 Junior Debt) with a market value of $119.3 million plus (ii) the issuance of 3.2 million shares of our common stock with a value of $254.6 million. In the case of the fiscal 2017 settlement, the principal value of $431.3 million was settled in cash and we issued shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount plus a cash inducement fee of $5.0 million. 

Other loss, net in fiscal 2019 was $2.2 million compared to other loss, net of $5.8 million in fiscal 2018 and other income, net of $1.3 million in fiscal 2017. The primary reasons for the change in other loss during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 relates to lower losses on investments offset by lower net gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The primary reasons for the change in other income (loss) during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to impairments on available for sale investments partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impairments on the available for sale investments were due to the anticipated liquidation of these investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to fund our acquisition of Microsemi.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes reflects tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on U.S. earnings. Our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were not meaningful due to the amount of pre-tax income and the tax benefits recorded during the period. Excluding certain tax events described below, our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the U.S. primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $27.5 million tax benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 13.4%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $13.3 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6.5%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $75.1 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 36.7%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes $95.4 million tax expense for GILTI, which increased our effective tax rate by 46.7%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $90.6 million tax benefit for business realignment, which reduced our effective tax rate by 44.3%. 

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes $644.7 million of tax expense estimated on a provisional basis, calculated under SAB 118, related to the one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings, $136.7 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted U.S. statutory tax rate 

48
of 21.0%, and $20.5 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the release of valuation allowances against our foreign tax credit carryforwards. These three adjustments increased (reduced) our effective tax rate by 87.4%, (18.5%), and (2.8%), respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $17.0 million tax benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 2.3%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $27.2 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.7%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $11.3 million benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.5%. 

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included $36.3 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and $7.9 million of expense related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization, which reduced our effective tax rate by 40.4% and increased our effective tax rate by 8.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a $12.8 million benefit received from current year generated R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 14.3%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a $25.0 million benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 27.8%. 

We are also subject to taxation in many other jurisdictions where we have operations. The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate. Our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was approximately 22% and our domestic statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 was approximately 33%. Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were much lower than this amount. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, historical loss carry-forwards, financing arrangements and other factors. Our effective tax rate has been, and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses. 

Our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in Thailand, Malta and Ireland. Our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand. Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays or we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20%. We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Our Microsemi operations in Malaysia are also subject to a tax holiday that effectively reduces Microsemi’s income tax rate in that jurisdiction. Microsemi’s tax holiday in Malaysia was granted in 2009 and is effective through December 2019, subject to continued compliance with the tax holiday’s requirements. The remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. are earnings accrued in Ireland at a 12.5% statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in Malta at a 0% tax rate.

Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 

Results of Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations represent the mobile touch operations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of Atmel. On November 10, 2016, we completed the sale of the mobile touch assets to Solomon Systech (Limited) International, a Hong Kong based semiconductor company. The transaction included the sale of certain semiconductor products, equipment, customer list, backlog, patents, and a license to certain other intellectual property and patents related to Atmel's mobile touch product line. We also agreed to provide certain transition services to Solomon Systech. For financial statement purposes, the results of operations for this discontinued business have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $6.0 million, consisting of a pre-tax loss from operations of $8.2 million and a pre-tax gain on sale of $0.6 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We had $430.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at March 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.77 billion from the March 31, 2018 balance. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to our acquisition of Microsemi.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.67 billion for fiscal 2019, $1.42 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.06 billion for fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to cash provided by our acquisition of Microsemi in fiscal 2019. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher net sales as well as operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring efforts related to our acquisition of Atmel.

Net cash used in investing activities was $6.81 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to $1.01 billion for fiscal 2018 and $2.84 billion in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2019 investing cash flows included net cash and cash equivalents used to finance our acquisition of Microsemi of $7.85 billion net of $340.0 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired, offset by net cash inflows of $1.29 billion due to the sale and maturity of available-for-sale debt securities to fund our acquisition of Microsemi, and capital expenditures of $228.9 million. Fiscal 2018 investing cash flows primarily result from the net increase in investments of $808.1 million due to cash from operations as well as capital purchases. Fiscal 2017 investing cash flows include net cash and cash equivalents used to finance our acquisition of Atmel of $2.75 billion. Excluding cash flows used in acquisitions, net investing activities resulted in net cash provided of $1.04 billion in fiscal 2019 and a use of $90.5 million in fiscal 2017, and represented primarily the net change in our investments, capital purchases and sale of assets. 

Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. Capital expenditures were $228.9 million, $206.8 million, and $75.3 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity, the addition of research and development equipment and new office buildings. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 were relatively less than we had experienced in recent years as we delayed certain purchases until we had finalized and developed plans following our acquisition of Atmel regarding technology platforms and other manufacturing activities. We currently intend to spend between $130 million and $150 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities. We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.66 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $415.3 million for fiscal 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities of $595.5 million for fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 financing cash outflows were primarily the result of dividend payments and payments on the settlement of our convertible debt. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 cash flows were favorably impacted by the net proceeds from amounts borrowed to fund our acquisitions of Microsemi and Atmel, respectively. Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On May 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Microsemi Corporation, a publicly traded company headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California. We paid an aggregate of approximately $8.19 billion in cash to the stockholders of Microsemi. The total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $53.9 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of Microsemi for stock awards for our common stock, was approximately $8.24 billion. In addition to the consideration transferred, we recognized $3.23 billion in liabilities in our consolidated financial statements of Microsemi consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, pension obligations, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities of which $2.06 billion of existing debt was paid off. We financed the purchase price using approximately $8.10 billion of borrowings consisting of $3.10 billion of loans under our Revolving Credit Facility, $3.00 billion under the Term Loan Facility, and $2.00 billion in newly issued senior secured notes. We incurred $22.0 million in acquisition costs related to the acquisition. During fiscal 2019, we voluntarily prepaid $1.09 billion of principal 

50
under the Term Loan Facility, of which $500.0 million was from funds borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2019, we had $1.91 billion of outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility.

In May 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") which provides for the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.84 billion, which was reduced to $3.60 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 through the termination of the 2020 Tranche, with a $250.0 million foreign currency sublimit, a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $25.0 million swingline loan sublimit. The Credit Agreement also provides for the Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility consists of $3.60 billion of revolving loan commitments (the "2023 Revolving Loans") that terminate on May 18, 2023 (the "2023 Maturity Date"). The 2023 Revolving Loans bear interest, at our option, at the base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 2.00%, in each case, with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. At March 31, 2019, we had $3.27 billion of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and no borrowings at March 31, 2018. See Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our Credit Agreement.

In June 2017, in connection with the settlement of $111.3 million of our convertible debt, we amended our credit agreement to (i) extend the time period during which we are permitted to repurchase, redeem or exchange our 2007 Junior Convertible Debt and (ii) amend the maximum total leverage ratio covenant to extend the time period for permitted refinancings or exchanges of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt that may be excluded from the calculation of the ratio, subject to certain conditions.

In February 2017, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, increase certain covenant compliance ratios. The February 2017 amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property. Proceeds of loans made under our credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

The enactment of the Act in December 2017 imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Due to this change, the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time, no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity. Future distributions of non-U.S. assets to the U.S. will no longer be subject to U.S. federal taxation. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As a result of the Act, as of March 31, 2018, we recognized a one-time provisional transition tax expense of $644.7 million on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings. As we concluded with our measurement period in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118, we finalized our calculations of the transition tax expense during the period ended December 31, 2018. As such, we increased our March 31, 2018 provisional amount by $13.1 million to $657.8 million, of which we expect cash payments of approximately $280.7 million after offsets by the utilization of various tax attribute carryforwards in the United States. This tax is to be paid over a period of eight years, with 8% of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid during fiscal 2024, 2025 and 2026.

 We enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years, there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future. At March 31, 2019, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.

On April 4, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Atmel. Under the terms of the merger agreement executed on January 19, 2016, Atmel stockholders received $8.15 per share consisting of $7.00 per share in cash and $1.15 per share in shares of Microchip common stock. We financed the purchase price of our Atmel acquisition using approximately $2.04 billion of cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, approximately $0.94 billion from additional borrowings under our credit agreement and approximately $486.1 million through the issuance of an aggregate of 10.1 million shares of our common stock. The acquisition price represented a total equity value of approximately $3.47 billion, and a total enterprise value of approximately $3.44 billion, after excluding Atmel's cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet of approximately $39.3 million. The acquisition was structured in a manner that enabled us to utilize a substantial portion of the cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner. Although we believe our determinations with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition are reasonable, we are regularly audited by the IRS and may be audited by other taxing authorities, and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such audit. 

51
There were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. As of March 31, 2019, we held approximately 15.6 million shares as treasury shares. 

On October 28, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share was paid on December 6, 2003 in the amount of $4.1 million. To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $3.8 billion. Cash dividends paid per share were $1.457, $1.449 and $1.441 during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Total dividend payments amounted to $344.4 million, $337.5 million, $315.4 million during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. A quarterly cash dividend of $0.3655 per share was declared on May 7, 2019 and will be paid on June 4, 2019, to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2019. We expect the aggregate cash dividend for June 4, 2019 to be approximately $87.0 million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws.

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the semiconductor industry is capital intensive. In order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development. We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash (including the impact of the Act), demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Operating lease obligations include $18.1 million of future lease payments which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. This obligation is due under an operating lease from our acquisition of Atmel for a building in San Jose, California.

(2) Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property, plant and equipment. These obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.

52
(3) Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries.

(4) The Term Loan Facility matures on May 29, 2025.

(5) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2023 revolving loans outstanding at March 31, 2019 will be paid on May 18, 2023, which is the maturity date of such borrowings.

(6) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 senior convertible debt will be paid on February 15, 2027, which is the maturity date of such debt.

(7) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt will be paid on February 15, 2025, which is the maturity date of such debt.

(8) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt will be paid on February 15, 2037, which is the maturity date of such debt.

(9) For purposes of this table, pension obligations due in more than 5 years represent the expected pension payments from 2025 through 2029. It excludes pension obligations subsequent to 2029.

(10) During fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisionary one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $644.7 million, as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform. As of December 31, 2018, with the conclusion of the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118, we increased this amount by $13.1 million to $657.8 million, of which we expect cash payments of approximately $280.7 million after offsets by the utilization of various tax attribute carryforwards in the United States. Our first payment on this obligation of $35.0 million was made in the quarter ended September 30, 2018 and we expect future cash payments of approximately $245.7 million. This tax is to be paid over a period of eight years, with 8% of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid during fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026.

(11) The contractual obligations do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services, with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries, are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.

The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)

As of March 31, 2019, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K with the exception of various operating leases for buildings and equipment entered into in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we may provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements. Based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements. For our operating leases, we expect to make cash payments and incur expenses throughout the lives of the operating leases. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases. We will record the associated lease obligations as a liability when we adopt the provisions of the Accounting Standard Update 2016-02-Leases. Refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard.
