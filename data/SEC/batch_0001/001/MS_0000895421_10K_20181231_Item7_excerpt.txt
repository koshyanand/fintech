Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Introduction  

Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segmentsInstitutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Morgan Stanley, Firm, us, we or our mean Morgan Stanley (the Parent Company) together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We define the following as part of our consolidated financial statements (financial statements): consolidated income statements (income statements), consolidated balance sheets (balance sheets) and consolidated cash flow statements (cash flow statements). See the Glossary of Common Acronyms for the definition of certain acronyms used throughout the 2018 Form 10-K.  

A description of the clients and principal products and services of each of our business segments is as follows:

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which among other things, requires a gross presentation of certain costs that were previously netted against net revenues. Prior periods have not been restated pursuant to this guidance. Refer to note 21 to the financial statements for further information on the full impact of adoption of this new accounting guidance.

For the calculation of basic and diluted EPS, see Note 16 to the financial statements.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2018 Compared with 2017  

     

We reported net revenues of $40,107 million in 2018 compared with $37,945 million in 2017. For 2018, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $8,748 million, or $4.73 per diluted common share, compared with $6,111 million, or $3.07 per diluted common share, in 2017.  

     

Results for 2018 include intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $203 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2018 is lower than in 2017, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).  

     

Results for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, or $0.53 per diluted common share, primarily related to the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations. For a discussion of the Tax Act and the net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.

Excluding the intermittent net discrete tax items, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $8,545 million, or $4.61 per diluted common share, compared with $7,079 million, or $3.60 per diluted common share, in 2017 (see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein).  

2017 compared with 2016  

     

We reported net revenues of $37,945 million in 2017 compared with $34,631 million in 2016. For 2017, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $6,111 million, or $3.07 per diluted common share, compared with $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, in 2016.  

     

Refer to the 2018 compared with 2017 commentary above for the 2017 intermittent net discrete tax impact. Results for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.  

     

Excluding the intermittent net discrete tax items, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $7,079 million, or $3.60 per diluted common share, in 2017 compared with $5,911 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, in 2016 (see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein).

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which among other things, requires a gross presentation of certain costs that were previously netted against net revenues. Prior periods have not been restated pursuant to this guidance. Refer to note 21 to the financial statements for further information on the full impact of adoption of this new accounting guidance. 

2018 Compared with 2017  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses of $17,632 million in 2018 increased 3% from $17,166 million in 2017. The 2018 results reflected increases in discretionary incentive compensation mainly driven by higher revenues and a reduction in the portion of discretionary incentive compensation subject to deferral (compensation deferral modification), as well as salaries across all business segments, the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, and amortization of deferred cash and equity awards. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Non-compensation expenses were $11,238 million in 2018 compared with $10,376 million in 2017, representing an 8% increase. This increase was primarily a result of higher volume-related expenses, the gross presentation of certain expenses due to the adoption of the accounting update Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see Notes 2 and 21 to the financial statements for further information) and increased investment in technology, partially offset by lower litigation expenses.  

2017 Compared with 2016  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses of $17,166 million in 2017 increased 8% from $15,878 million in 2016. The 2017 results reflected increases in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives linked to higher revenues, the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, discretionary incentive compensation mainly driven by higher revenues and deferred compensation associated with carried interest in the Investment Management business segment.  

     

Non-compensation expenses were $10,376 million in 2017 compared with $9,905 million in 2016, representing a 5% increase. This increase was primarily a result of higher volume-related expenses and litigation costs.

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information  

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, Definitive Proxy Statement and otherwise. A non-GAAP financial measure excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors and analysts by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, our financial condition, operating results, prospective regulatory capital requirements or capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure.  

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth below.

Return on Equity and Tangible Common Equity Targets  

We have established an ROE Target of 10% to 13% and an ROTCE Target of 11.5% to 14.5%. Excluding the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, we generated an 11.5% ROE and a 13.2% ROTCE for 2018.  

Our ROE and ROTCE Targets are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; outsized legal expenses or penalties and the ability to maintain a reduced level of expenses; and capital levels. See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for additional information.

Business Segments  

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.  

As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results. See Note 21 to the financial statements for further information.  

Net Revenues  

Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.  

Trading. Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which we act as a market maker, as well as gains and losses on our related positions and other positions carried at fair value. Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other positions carried at fair value. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses 

 from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.  

As a market maker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:  

 (i)  

taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell anddepending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the positionto hold those positions for a period of time;  

 (ii)  

building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory through trades with other market participants;  

 (iii)  

managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;  

 (iv)  

trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and  

 (v)  

engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.  

Interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held by us earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreements to repurchase and purchased with agreements to resell.  

We invest in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in either Trading revenues or Investments revenues. Expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in Compensation and benefits. See Compensation Expense herein for more details.  

Investments. Our investments are generally held for long-term appreciation, for hedging purposes, or as part of offering related products or services.  

Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment 

    31   December 2018 Form 10-K

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.  

Certain investments are subject to sales restrictions or are required to be held in order to carry out related activities.  

Commissions and Fees. Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded in Commissions and fees. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for any related services are recorded in Commissions and fees.  

Asset Management. Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.  

Net Interest. Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities (which include AFS and HTM securities), Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings. In addition, Net interest is a function of trading strategies, customer activity in the prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.  

Other. Other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, realized gains and losses on AFS securities, gains and losses on loan commitments and loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Net Revenues by Segment  

Institutional Securities  

Net revenues are composed of Investment banking revenues, sales and trading net revenues, Investments and Other revenues.  

For information about the composition of Investment banking revenues, see Net Revenues herein.  

Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues and Net interest. In assessing the profitability of our sales and trading activities, we view these net revenues in the aggregate. Decisions relating to trading are based on an overall review of 

 aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.  

Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equities and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items.  

EquitiesFinancing. We provide financing and prime brokerage services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities and equity lending products and in Trading revenues for derivative products.  

EquitiesExecution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including providing liquidity and hedging products. Market making also generates gains and losses on inventory positions, which are reflected in Trading revenues.  

Fixed incomeWithin fixed income, we make markets in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services:  

     

Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues.  

     

Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial mortgage lending, asset-backed lending and financing extended to customers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues. 

 December 2018 Form 10-K   32     

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals, with the results primarily reflected in Trading revenues. Other activities primarily include results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures, which are primarily recorded in Trading revenues.  

Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain central treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains (losses) on economic hedges related to certain borrowings, as well as certain activities associated with corporate lending.  

For information about revenues from Investments, see Net Revenues herein.  

Other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, gains and losses on held for sale loans and lending commitments, fees earned in association with lending activities, provision for loan losses and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Wealth Management  

Net revenues are composed of Transactional, Asset management, Net interest and Other revenues.  

Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees. Investment banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. Trading revenues primarily include revenues from customers purchases and sales of fixed income financial instruments, in which we act as principal, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Revenues from Commissions and fees primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.  

Asset management revenues primarily consist of revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement. Wealth Management also receives mutual fund distribution fees, which are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of AUM.  

Net interest income includes interest on lending activities, interest on AFS and HTM securities, interest related to Deposits and other net interest. Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. Net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, brokerage sweep deposits, time deposits and other funding sources. 

Other revenues include revenues from realized gains and losses on AFS securities, provision for loan losses, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.  

Investment Management  

Net revenues are composed of Investments and Asset management revenues.  

Investments revenues are primarily derived from investments made as part of our product offerings. In certain cases these investments are subject to sales restrictions. In addition to the gains and losses discussed previously, Investments revenues for Investment Management also contain performance fees from fund management activities in the form of carried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us where revenues are primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.  

Asset management revenues include revenues from investment management services we provide to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. We receive fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are generally recognized annually.  

Compensation Expense  

Compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, carried interest, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits.  

The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for most other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firms, business units and individuals performance. Compensation for our remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (i.e., base salary and benefits). 

    33   December 2018 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. 

Income Taxes  

The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

2018 Compared with 2017  

Investment banking revenues of $6,088 million in 2018 increased 10% from 2017. The adoption of the accounting update Revenue from Contracts with Customers had the effect of increasing the revenues reported in investment banking by approximately $283 million in 2018 compared with 2017 (see Notes 2 and 21 to the financial statements for further information). The drivers of the increase in our Investment banking revenues, other than the effect of the above accounting update, were:

Advisory revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes of completed M&A activity (see Investment Banking Volumes table), partially offset by lower fee realizations.  

     

Equity underwriting revenues increased as a result of higher fee realizations. Revenues increased in IPOs and convertible offerings, partially offset by lower revenues from secondary block share trades.

     

Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes, partially offset by the effect of higher fee realizations. Revenues decreased in bond underwriting fees, partially offset by higher loan fees.  

2017 Compared with 2016  

Investment banking revenues of $5,537 million in 2017 increased 24% from 2016 due to higher underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower advisory revenues.  

     

Advisory revenues decreased reflecting the lower volumes of completed M&A (see Investment Banking Volumes table), partially offset by the positive impact of higher fee realizations.  

     

Equity underwriting revenues increased as a result of higher global market volumes in both follow-on and initial public offerings (see Investment Banking Volumes table) combined with a higher share of fees.  

     

Fixed income underwriting revenues increased due to higher bond fees and non-investment grade loan fees.

Includes funding costs, which are allocated to the businesses based on funding usage.  

As discussed in Net Revenues by Segment herein, we manage each of the sales and trading businesses based on its aggregate net revenues, which are composed of the income statement line items quantified in the previous table. Trading revenues are affected by a variety of market dynamics, including volumes, bid-offer spreads and inventory prices, as well as impacts from hedging activity, which are interrelated. We provide qualitative commentary in the discussion of results that follow on the key drivers of period-over-period variances, as the quantitative impact of the various market dynamics typically cannot be disaggregated.  

For additional information on total Trading revenues, see the table Trading Revenues by Product Type in Note 21 to the financial statements.  

2018 Compared with 2017  

Equity  

Equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,976 million in 2018 increased 12% from 2017, reflecting higher results in both our financing and execution services businesses.  

     

Financing increased from 2017, primarily due to higher average client balances and changes in client balance mix, which resulted in increased Trading and Net interest revenues. 

 December 2018 Form 10-K   36     

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Execution services increased from 2017, primarily reflecting higher Commissions and fees due to higher client activity in cash equities products. Trading revenues increased due to effective inventory management in derivatives products. Net interest revenues declined due to increased funding costs.  

Fixed Income  

Fixed income net revenues of $5,005 million in 2018 were 2% higher than in 2017, primarily driven by higher results in commodities products and other, partially offset by lower results in credit products.  

     

Global macro products revenues remained relatively unchanged as revenues from higher client activity in foreign exchange products were offset by unfavorable inventory management results in both rates and foreign exchange products. These results were driven by significant movements in interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a breakdown of historical correlations, which increased basis risk in the portfolio. Net interest revenues declined due to increased funding costs.  

     

Credit products Trading revenues decreased in both corporate credit and securitized products, driven by significant credit spread widening in the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by growth in lending products.  

     

Commodities products and Other Trading revenues increased primarily due to increased Commodities client flow and structured transactions, as well as positive results from a reduction in derivative counterparty credit risk.  

Other  

     

Other sales and trading net losses of $204 million in 2018 decreased from 2017, primarily due to improved results from hedge accounting applied to our long-term borrowings, lower net funding costs reflecting changes in the balance sheet and lower losses associated with corporate loan hedging activity, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

2017 Compared with 2016  

Equity  

Equity sales and trading net revenues of $7,982 million in 2017 decreased 1% from 2016, reflecting lower results in execution services.  

     

Financing remained relatively unchanged from 2016. The results reflected higher client activity in equity swaps reflected in Trading revenues, offset by a decline in Net 

 interest revenues from higher net interest costs, reflecting the business increased portion of GLR requirements and a shift in the mix of financing transactions.  

     

Execution services decreased from 2016, primarily reflecting lower results in derivative products mainly driven by lower corporate activity and volatility, partially offset by higher gains on cash equity products recorded in Trading revenues.  

Fixed Income  

Fixed income net revenues of $4,928 million in 2017 were 4% lower than in 2016, driven by lower results in global macro products, partially offset by higher results in credit products, and commodities products and other.  

     

Global macro products decreased primarily due to the lack of a constructive market environment, inventory positioning, and lower client activity reflected in both Trading and Net interest.  

     

Credit products increased primarily due to the absence of losses driven by a widening spread environment in 2016 and increased securitization activity reflected in Trading revenues, partially offset by reduced Net interest revenues. Net interest revenues decreased as a result of a lower level of interest realized in securitized products and lower net interest spreads, partially offset by increased lending activity.  

     

Commodities products and Other increased primarily due to higher revenues in other lending and OTC client clearing.  

Other  

     

Other sales and trading net losses of $632 million in 2017 decreased from 2016, primarily reflecting lower losses associated with corporate loan hedging activity and increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, partially offset by higher funding costs.

2018 Compared with 2017  

Investments  

     

Net investment gains of $182 million in 2018 decreased from 2017 as a result of lower gains on business-related investments, losses due to the market deterioration of a publicly traded investment subject to sale restrictions and lower results from real estate limited partnership investments.

Other Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Non-interest Expenses  

Non-interest expenses of $14,322 million in 2018 increased from 2017, primarily reflecting a 5% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and a 13% increase in Non-compensation expenses in 2018.  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018, primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation driven by higher revenues and the compensation deferral modification, as well as salaries and amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Non-compensation expenses increased in 2018, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and the gross presentation of certain expenses due to the adoption of the accounting update Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see Notes 2 and 21 to the financial statements for further information), partially offset by lower litigation expenses and the reversal of a portion of previously recorded provisions related to U.K. VAT matters.  

2017 Compared with 2016  

Investments  

     

Net investment gains of $368 million in 2017 increased from 2016 as a result of higher gains on business-related and real estate limited partnership investments. In addition, in 2017, we recorded gains on investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced compared with losses in 2016.  

Other Revenues  

     

Other revenues of $630 million in 2017 increased from 2016, primarily reflecting a decrease in the provision on loans held for investment and higher results from other investments, partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains on loans held for sale. 

Non-interest Expenses  

Non-interest expenses of $13,169 million in 2017 increased from 2016, primarily reflecting a 6% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and an 8% increase in Non-compensation expenses in 2017.  

     

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2017, primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, and discretionary incentive compensation driven mainly by higher revenues.  

     

Non-compensation expenses increased in 2017, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and litigation costs related to legacy RMBS matters.  

Income Tax Items  

The effective tax rate in 2018 is lower compared with 2017, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. For a discussion of the Tax Act and other discrete items, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein and Note 20 to the financial statements. In 2018, we recognized in Provision for income taxes an intermittent net discrete tax benefit of $182 million, primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.  

In 2017, we recognized in Provision for income taxes an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $471 million. This net discrete tax provision included an approximate $705 million impact from the Tax Act, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations.  

In 2016, we recognized in Provision for income taxes intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $83 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.

Income Statement Information  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Effective July 1, 2016, the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments entered into an agreement, whereby Institutional Securities assumed management of Wealth Managements fixed income client-driven trading activities and employees. Institutional Securities now pays fees to Wealth Management based on distribution activity (collectively, the Fixed Income Integration). Results prior to the Fixed Income Integration have not been recast for this new intersegment agreement due to immateriality.

2018 Compared with 2017  

Net Revenues  

Transactional Revenues  

Transactional revenues of $2,558 million in 2018 decreased 18% from 2017 as a result of lower Trading revenues and Investment banking fees, partially offset by higher Commissions and fees.  

     

Investment banking revenues decreased in 2018, primarily due to lower revenues from structured product and equity issuances.  

     

Trading revenues decreased in 2018, primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with gains in 2017, and lower fixed income fee revenues driven by product mix.  

     

Commissions and fees increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily as a result of increased client transactions in alternative products, options and futures, partially offset by reduced activity in mutual funds.  

Asset Management  

Asset management revenues of $10,158 million in 2018 increased 9% compared with 2017, primarily due to the effect of higher fee-based client assets levels in 2018 on the dates on which billings were calculated, generally the beginning of each calendar quarter. Beginning of quarter fee-based client assets increased in 2018 due to market appreciation and net positive flows, but the effect on revenues was partially offset by lower average fee rates across all account types.  

See Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards herein.  

Net Interest  

Net interest of $4,277 million in 2018 increased 4% compared with 2017, primarily as a result of higher loan interest rates and balances, partially offset by the effect of higher interest rates on Deposits due to changes in our funding mix.  

Other  

Other revenues of $248 million in 2018 decreased 7% compared with 2017, primarily due to lower realized gains from the AFS securities portfolio. 

Non-interest Expenses  

Non-interest expenses of $12,721 million in 2018 increased 1% compared with 2017 primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses.

     

Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged in 2018, with increased investment in technology offset by a decrease in consulting and litigation expenses.  

2017 Compared with 2016  

Net Revenues  

Transactional Revenues  

Transactional revenues of $3,118 million in 2017 were relatively unchanged from 2016, as increased Investment banking revenues were offset by decreased Trading revenues.  

     

Investment banking revenues increased in 2017, primarily due to higher revenues from structured products and equity syndicate activities, partially offset by lower preferred stock syndicate activity.  

     

Trading revenues decreased in 2017, primarily due to lower revenues related to the Fixed Income Integration and lower client activity in fixed income products, partially offset by gains on investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Commissions and fees were relatively unchanged in 2017 compared with 2016.  

Asset Management  

Asset management revenues of $9,342 million in 2017 increased 11% compared with 2016, primarily due to market appreciation and net positive flows. These increases were partially offset by decreases in average fee rates across all account types.  

See Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards herein.  

Net Interest  

Net interest of $4,105 million in 2017 increased 16% compared with 2016, primarily due to higher loan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits.

     

Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2017, primarily due to the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives linked to higher revenues, and due to increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.  

     

Non-compensation expenses decreased in 2017, primarily due to the absence of a $70 million provision recorded in 2016 related to certain brokerage service reporting activities and lower litigation and information processing costs, partially offset by higher consulting fees related to strategic initiatives and higher FDIC insurance expenses.  

Income Tax Items  

The effective tax rate in 2018 is lower compared with 2017, primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. For a discussion of the Tax Act, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.  

In 2017, we recognized in Provision for income taxes an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $411 million, which included approximately $402 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act.  

Fee-Based Client Assets  

Wealth Management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of fee-based client assets related to certain account types that we offer. These fees, which we record in the Asset management line on our income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the client participates and are generally not driven by asset class. For most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the beginning of the quarter. Across the account types, fees will vary based on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in Wealth Management.

2018 Compared with 2017  

Net Revenues  

Investments  

Investments gains of $254 million in 2018 compared with $449 million in 2017 reflect lower carried interest in certain infrastructure and Asia private equity funds and losses on seed investments in certain Alternative/Other products.  

Asset Management  

Asset management revenues of $2,468 million increased 12% compared with 2017, primarily as a result of higher average long-term AUM. See AUM Rollforwards herein.  

In addition, the adoption of the accounting update Revenue from Contracts with Customers had the effect of increasing Asset management revenues due to the gross presentation of distribution fees (approximately $78 million in 2018). See Notes 2 and 21 to the financial statements for further details. 

Other

 2.  

Beginning in 2017, with the adoption of the accounting update Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, the income tax consequences associated with employee share-based awards are recognized in Provision for income taxes in the income statements. We consider these employee share-based award related provisions (benefits) to be recurring-type (Recurring) discrete tax items, as we anticipate some level of conversion activity each year. Accordingly, these Recurring discrete tax provisions (benefits) are excluded from the intermittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits) adjustment.

Includes all tax provisions (benefits) that have been determined to be discrete, other than Recurring items as defined above.  

2018  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2018 includes intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $203 million, primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.  

The effective tax rate reflects our current assumptions, estimates and interpretations related to the Tax Act and other 

 factors. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, partially or wholly eliminating tax deductions for certain expenses and implementing a modified territorial tax system. The modified territorial tax system includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and also imposes a minimum tax on GILTI and an alternative BEAT on U.S. corporations with operations outside of the U.S. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations and guidance on certain provisions in the Tax Act during 2018, although some of these regulations have not yet been finalized, and are, therefore, still subject to change. Our income tax estimates may change as additional clarification and implementation guidance continue to be received from the U.S. Treasury Department and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time.  

2017  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, primarily related to the impact of the Tax Act, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations.  

We recorded an approximate $1.2 billion net discrete tax provision as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, primarily from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets using the lower enacted corporate tax rate. This provision incorporated the best available information as of the enactment date, as well as assumptions made based upon our interpretation of the Tax Act.  

2016  

The effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year IRS tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.

Derivatives and Hedging (ASU 2018-16). The amendments in this update permit use of the OIS rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. We adopted this update on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships; this update does not impact our existing hedges. 

     

Leases. This accounting update requires lessees to recognize all leases with terms exceeding one year in the balance sheet, which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged.  

The right of use asset and lease liability were initially measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. We adopted this accounting update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.  

At transition on January 1, 2019, the adoption of this standard resulted in a balance sheet gross-up of approximately $4 billion reflected in Other assets and Other liabilities and accrued expenses. In addition, previously deferred gains from sale-leaseback transactions of approximately $60 million were recognized directly into retained earnings. Prior period amounts were not restated.  

The following accounting update is currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:  

     

Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses. This accounting update impacts the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. CECL will replace the loss model currently applicable to loans held for investment, HTM securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.  

The update also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for AFS securities. Impairments on AFS securities will be required to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists or the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.  

Under the update, there may be an ability to determine there are no expected credit losses in certain circumstances, e.g., based on collateral arrangements for lending and financing transactions or based on the credit quality of the borrower or issuer.  

Based on preliminary estimates, we expect the impact from the adoption of this standard will primarily result from the employee loans, wholesale real estate, corporate and residential real estate portfolios. The models we expect to use for these portfolios are in the process of being tested. This update is effective as of January 1, 2020.

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  

Fair Value  

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value  

A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:  

     

Trading assets and Trading liabilities;  

     

Investment SecuritiesAFS securities;  

     

Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;  

     

Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;  

     

Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;  

     

Certain Other secured financings; and  

     

Certain Borrowings, primarily structured notes.  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  

In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. 

In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the definition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements.  

Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements.  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis  

Certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs, intangible assets, other assets, and other liabilities and accrued expenses. We incur losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.  

See Note 3 to the financial statements for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill  

Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. 

    47   December 2018 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist.  

For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.  

When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  

The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.  

Intangible Assets  

Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.  

For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.  

See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. 

Legal and Regulatory Contingencies  

In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.  

Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.  

We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  

Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.  

For certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties.  

Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.  

See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information on legal proceedings.  

Income Taxes  

We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions.  

Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.  

Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.  

Our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. 

Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.  

Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.  

See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (Board), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.  

Balance Sheet  

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.  

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

 1.  

Cash and cash equivalents includes Cash and due from banks, Interest bearing deposits with banks and Restricted cash.  

 2.  

Amounts include loans held for investment (net of allowance) and loans held for sale but exclude loans at fair value, which are included in Trading assets in the balance sheets (see Note 7 to the financial statements).  

 3.  

Other assets primarily includes Goodwill, Intangible assets, premises, equipment, software, other investments and deferred tax assets.  

A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. Total assets of $853.5 billion at December 31, 2018 were relatively unchanged compared with $851.7 billion at December 31, 2017. In 2018, Loans increased in the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments; deposit growth in the Wealth Management business segment led to increases in Investment securities and Securities purchased under agreements to resell; Trading assets within the Institutional Securities business segment declined due to reductions in Equities inventory, which resulted in greater liquidity, as reflected by increases in Cash and cash equivalents and Securities purchased under agreements to resell; and Securities borrowed within the Institutional Securities business segment decreased due to lower client balances and Trading liabilities.  

Liquidity Risk Management Framework  

The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies.  

The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:  

     

Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;  

     

Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;  

     

Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and  

     

Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.  

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the GLR, which support our target liquidity profile.  

Required Liquidity Framework  

Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.  

Liquidity Stress Tests  

We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework.  

The assumptions used by us in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:  

     

No government support;  

     

No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;  

     

Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon; 

 December 2018 Form 10-K   50     

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

     

Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;  

     

Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;  

     

Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;  

     

Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;  

     

Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and  

     

Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions.  

Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.  

At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.  

Global Liquidity Reserve  

We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the GLR is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. In addition, our GLR includes a discretionary surplus based on risk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and Firm-specific events. The GLR is held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The GLR consists of cash and unencumbered securities sourced 

 from trading assets, investment securities and securities received as collateral.

GLR Managed by Bank and Non-Bank Legal Entities  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework  

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to LCR requirements, including a requirement to calculate each entitys LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. 

    51   December 2018 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

The regulatory definition of HQLA is substantially the same as our GLR. GLR includes cash placed at institutions other than central banks that is considered an inflow for LCR purposes. HQLA includes a portion of cash placed at central banks, certain unencumbered investment grade corporate bonds and publicly traded common equities, which do not meet the definition of our GLR.  

Based on our daily calculations, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%.  

HQLA by Type of Asset and LCR  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.  

The increase in the LCR in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 is due to increased HQLA consistent with higher liquidity levels, and a reduction in net outflows (i.e., the denominator of the ratio), primarily driven by lower secured funding and lending commitment outflows.  

The Firms calculations are based on our current understanding of the LCR and other factors, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators and as the interpretation of the LCR evolves over time.  

Net Stable Funding Ratio  

The objective of the NSFR is to reduce funding risk over a one-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.  

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) has previously finalized the NSFR framework. In May 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would require a covered company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is measured with reference to sources of funding, including deposit and debt liabilities, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is measured by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items.  

If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. We continue to evaluate the 

 potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures. Our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary to meet the requirement, which we would expect to accomplish by the effective date of any final rule. Our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ materially from estimates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see Risk Factors.  

Funding Management  

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.  

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.  

Secured Financing  

The liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded.  

We have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria.  

To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our GLR against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities. 

 December 2018 Form 10-K   52     

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

We generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which takes into account HQLA classifications consistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory requirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.  

Collateralized Financing Transactions  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Securities received as collateral are included in Trading assets in the balance sheets.  

See Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements for more details on collateralized financing transactions.  

In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheets, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheets. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.  

Unsecured Financing  

We view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our unsecured financings include structured borrowings, which are primarily composed of: instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. When appropriate, we may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to 

 our interest rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the financial statements).  

Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

Amounts represent balances swept from client brokerage accounts.  

Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. Total deposits at December 31, 2018 increased compared with December 31, 2017, driven by increases in Time deposits, which primarily consist of brokered certificates of deposit with fixed interest rates and maturity dates. The increase in Brokerage sweep deposits reflects the redesign of our brokerage sweep deposit program in 2018, resulting in inflows of approximately $18 billion, partially offset by client deployment of cash into investments throughout the year. The increase in Savings and other deposits was driven by promotional client offerings.  

The inflows related to the redesign of our brokerage sweep deposit program corresponded with outflows from Liquidity products AUM in the Investment Management business segment (see Business SegmentsInvestment ManagementAssets Under Management or Supervision for more information).  

Borrowings by Remaining Maturity at December 31, 20181  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date. 

    53   December 2018 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Borrowings of $189,662 million as of December 31, 2018 remained relatively unchanged compared with $192,582 million at December 31, 2017.  

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.  

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business.  

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 11 to the financial statements.  

Credit Ratings  

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider company-specific factors, other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes and the macroeconomic environment, among other things.  

Our credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of U.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from non-governmental third-party sources of potential support.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments  

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features.  

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.  

Capital Management  

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Common Stock  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

From time to time we repurchase our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program. On April 18, 2018, we entered into a sales plan with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG), whereby MUFG sells shares of the Firms common stock to us as part of our share repurchase program.

Regulatory Requirements  

Regulatory Capital Framework  

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see Note 14 to the financial statements.

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  

Regulatory Capital Requirements  

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements.  

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in AOCI and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.  

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, we are subject to the following buffers in 2019:  

     

A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;  

     

The Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and  

     

Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies at zero.  

In 2018 and 2017, each of the buffers was 75% and 50%, respectively, of the fully phased-in 2019 requirement noted above. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see G-SIB Capital Surcharge herein.  

Risk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:  

     

Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;  

     

Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and  

     

Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). 

For a further discussion of our credit, market and operational risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk.  

Our risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (Standardized Approach) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (Advanced Approach). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2018, our ratios for determining regulatory compliance are based on the Standardized Approach rules, while at December 31, 2017, the ratios were based on the Standardized Approach transitional rules.  

Effective January 1, 2019, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital requirements, inclusive of buffers, increase to 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively.  

See Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements herein for additional capital requirements effective January 1, 2019.  

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR. The SLR became effective as a capital standard on January 1, 2018. We are required to maintain a Tier 1 SLR of 3%, as well as an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2% (for a total of at least 5%) in order to avoid potential limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets under U.S. GAAP during the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, adjusted for disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other capital deductions.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 3.  

Regulatory compliance at December 31, 2017 was determined based on capital ratios calculated under transitional rules.  

At December 31, 2017, the pro forma fully phased-in estimated amounts and the pro forma estimated SLR utilized fully phased-in Tier 1 capital, including the fully phased-in Tier 1 capital deductions that applied beginning January 1, 2018. These pro forma fully phased-in estimates were non-GAAP financial measures as the related capital rules were not yet effective at December 31, 2017. These estimates were based on our understanding of the capital rules and other factors at the time.  

Regulatory compliance was determined based on capital ratios, including regulatory capital and RWA, calculated under the transitional rules until December 31, 2017. The regulatory capital analyses in the following tables are presented using pro forma fully phased-in estimates as of December 31, 2017, which are on an equivalent basis to amounts calculated as of December 31, 2018.

 3.  

Amount reflects assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures and unsettled transactions, as applicable.  

Credit risk RWA increased in 2018 under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to increased corporate lending exposures within the Institutional Securities business segment. Under the Standardized Approach, this increase was partially offset by a reduction in RWA for Securities financing transactions due to a decline in the market value of associated securities. Under the Advanced Approach, Credit risk RWA also increased in 2018 for Investment securities driven by model revisions that increased the risk weighting for certain counterparty types.  

Market risk RWA decreased in 2018 under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to a decrease in non-securitization-specific risk charges mainly as a result of reduced exposures in equity derivatives and bonds. In addition, securitization-specific risk charges decreased primarily 

 due to reduced exposures in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations.  

The decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach in 2018 reflects a continued reduction in the frequency and magnitude of internal losses utilized in the operational risk capital model related to litigation and execution and processing, partially offset by an increase associated with a risk scenario update.  

G-SIB Capital Surcharge  

We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIBs size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (Method 1). The second method uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (Method 2) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. As of January 1, 2019, our current fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge is 3%. In 2018 and 2017, the phase-in amount was 75% and 50%, respectively, of the applicable surcharge (see Risk-Based Regulatory Capital herein).  

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements  

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (LTD) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (covered BHCs), including the Parent Company. These requirements include various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured, have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance and not have certain derivative-linked features typically associated with certain types of structured notes. We are in compliance with all relevant TLAC requirements as of the compliance date of January 1, 2019.  

The main purpose of the Federal Reserves minimum external TLAC and LTD requirements is to ensure that covered BHCs, including the Parent Company, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning and Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk). 

 December 2018 Form 10-K   58     

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

Under the final rule, a covered BHC is required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA and (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 and Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company, and (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.  

In addition, the final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHCs Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage-exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHCs total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the TLAC buffers would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  

The final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.  

Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external short-term debt or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHCs outstanding external TLAC amount.  

The Federal Reserve has proposed modifications to the enhanced SLR that would also make corresponding changes to the calibration of the TLAC leverage-based requirements, as well as certain other technical changes to the TLAC rule. For a further discussion of the enhanced SLR, see Regulatory DevelopmentsProposed Modifications to the Enhanced SLR and to the SLR Applicable to Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries herein.  

Capital Plans and Stress Tests  

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual CCAR framework.  

We must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorpo-

 rate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.  

The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the requirements that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.  

The capital plan rule requires that large BHCs receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the BHC must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the BHC would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A BHCs ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.  

In addition, we are currently required to conduct semiannual company-run stress tests and are subject to an annual Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The EGRRCPA modifies certain aspects of these stress-testing requirements, reducing the number of scenarios in the Federal Reserves supervisory stress test from three to two and modifying our obligation to perform company-run stress-tests from semiannually to annually. The Federal Reserve has issued proposed rulemakings to implement these modifications and is currently considering making further changes to its capital planning and stress testing requirements. See Regulatory Developments herein.  

Prior to the enactment of the EGRRCPA, each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries was also required to conduct an annual stress test. MSBNA and MSPBNA submitted their 2018 annual company-run stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2018 and published a summary of their stress test results on June 21, 2018. The EGRRCPA eliminated the statutory requirement to conduct company-run stress-tests for banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, which includes both of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.  

We submitted our 2018 Capital Plan (Capital Plan) and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 April 5, 2018. On June 21, 2018, the Federal Reserve published summary results of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us. On June 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve published summary results of CCAR, and we received a conditional non-objection to our Capital Plan, where the only condition was that our capital distributions not exceed the greater of the actual distributions we made over the previous four calendar quarters or the annualized average of actual distributions over the previous eight calendar quarters.  

Our 2018 Capital Plan includes the repurchase of up to $4.7 billion of outstanding common stock for the period beginning July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 and an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.30 per share, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 18, 2018. The total amount of expected 2018 capital distributions is consistent with the $6.8 billion of actual dividends and gross share repurchases included in our 2017 Capital Plan. We disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on June 21, 2018 on our Investor Relations webpage. In addition, we submitted the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve and on October 22, 2018 disclosed a summary of the results on our Investor Relations webpage.  

For the 2019 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2019. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us, by June 30, 2019. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. In addition, we must submit the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve by October 5, 2019 and disclose a summary of the results between October 5, 2019 and November 4, 2019.  

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework  

Our required capital (Required Capital) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segments relative contribution to our total Required Capital.  

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. We define the 

 difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.  

The estimation and attribution of common equity to the business segments are based on the fully phased-in regulatory capital rules. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). Differences between available and Required Capital are attributed to Parent common equity during the year.  

The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment, for example, to incorporate changes in stress testing or enhancements to modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

Resolution and Recovery Planning  

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.  

Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2017 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. The Parent Company has amended and restated its secured support agreement with its material entities, as defined in our 2017 resolution plan. Under the secured amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its contributable material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities. 

 December 2018 Form 10-K   60     

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

The obligations of the Parent Company under the secured amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material entities against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.  

In further development of our SPOE strategy, we have created a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, MS Holdings LLC (the Funding IHC), to serve as a resolution funding vehicle. We expect that, prior to the submission of our 2019 resolution plan by July 1, 2019, the Parent Company will contribute certain of its assets to the Funding IHC and enter into an updated secured amended and restated support agreement with the Funding IHC as well as certain other subsidiaries to facilitate the execution of our SPOE strategy. Similar to the existing secured amended and restated support agreement, the updated secured amended and restated support agreement will obligate the Parent Company to transfer capital and liquidity, as revised, to the Funding IHC, and that the Parent Company and/or the Funding IHC will recapitalize and provide liquidity to material entities in the event of our material financial distress or failure.  

For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning and Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.  

Regulatory Developments  

Proposed Stress Buffer Requirements  

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing applicable regulatory capital requirements. The proposal, which would apply to certain BHCs, including us, would introduce a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer (collectively, Stress Buffer Requirements) and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes. Under the proposal, Stress Buffer Requirements would apply only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and Tier 1 leverage regulatory capital requirements.  

Under Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements, the stress capital buffer would replace the existing Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which is 2.5% as of January 1, 2019. The Standardized Approach stress capital buffer would equal the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory 

 stress test measurement period plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to our projected RWA for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period and (ii) 2.5%. Regulatory capital requirements under the Standardized Approach would include the stress capital buffer, as summarized above, as well as our Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge and any applicable Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB.  

Like the stress capital buffer, the stress leverage buffer would be calculated based on the results of our annual supervisory stress tests. The stress leverage buffer would equal the maximum decline in our Tier 1 leverage ratio under the severely adverse scenario, plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to our projected leverage ratio denominator for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period. No floor would be established for the stress leverage buffer, which would apply in addition to the current minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.  

The proposal would make related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for BHCs subject to the Stress Buffer Requirements. In particular, for purposes of determining the size of Stress Buffer Requirements, the proposal would include only projected capital actions to planned common stock dividends in the fourth through seventh quarters of the stress test projection period and would assume that BHCs maintain a constant level of assets and RWA throughout the supervisory stress test projection period.  

The proposal does not change regulatory capital requirements under the Advanced Approach or the SLR, although the Federal Reserve and the OCC have separately proposed to modify the enhanced SLR requirements, as summarized below. If the proposal is adopted in its current form, limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers would be determined by the most stringent limitation, if any, as determined under Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements or the Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of Stress Buffer Requirements, or the Advanced Approach or SLR or TLAC requirements, inclusive of applicable buffers.  

While the proposal included an intended effective date of October 1, 2019, the Federal Reserve has not yet taken action to finalize or implement Stress Buffer Requirements.  

Proposed Modifications to the Enhanced SLR and to the SLR Applicable to Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries  

The Federal Reserve has proposed modifications to the enhanced SLR that would replace the current 2% enhanced SLR buffer applicable to U.S. G-SIBs, including us, with a leverage buffer equal to 50% of our G-SIB capital surcharge. 

    61   December 2018 Form 10-K  

Table of Contents 

Managements Discussion and Analysis      

 Under the proposal, our enhanced SLR buffer would become 1.5%, for a total enhanced SLR requirement of 4.5%, assuming that our G-SIB capital surcharge remains the same when the proposal becomes effective.  

The Federal Reserve and the OCC have also proposed to modify the well-capitalized SLR standard applicable to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The requirement would change from the current 6% to 3% plus 50% of our G-SIB capital surcharge, for a total well-capitalized SLR requirement of 4.5% for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, assuming that our G-SIB capital surcharge remains the same when the proposal becomes effective.  

Regulatory Capital and Stress Testing Developments Related to Implementation of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology  

In December 2018, the U.S. banking agencies finalized revisions to the regulatory capital framework applicable to banking organizations, including us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, to address the new accounting standard for credit losses, known as a CECL methodology that will be effective January 1, 2020. For a further discussion of CECL, see Accounting Development UpdatesFinancial InstrumentsCredit Losses.  

The revisions modify the regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the new accounting standard are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and provide banking organizations the option to phase in, over a three-year period, the adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. A banking organization that has adopted a CECL methodology must include the provision for credit losses beginning in the 2020 stress test cycle.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve issued a statement that it will maintain the current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the 2021 cycle.  

Proposed Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk  

The U.S. banking agencies have issued a proposal to incorporate the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), a new derivatives counterparty exposure methodology, into the regulatory capital framework and related regulatory standards. As proposed, SA-CCR would replace the current exposure method, on a mandatory basis, in our and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries Standardized Approach RWA, central counterparty default fund contributions and, in modified form, in Supplementary Leverage Ratio exposure calculations. SA-CCR would be available as an alternative in our and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries Advanced Approach 

 RWA for trade exposures, in single counterparty credit limits applicable to us, and in bank lending limits applicable to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The proposal would require us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to implement SA-CCR by July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted after the rule is finalized.  

Other Matters  

U.K. Withdrawal from the E.U.  

Following the U.K. electorate vote to leave the E.U., the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, 2017, which triggered a two-year period, subject to extension (which would need the unanimous approval of the E.U. Member States), during which the U.K. government negotiated a form of withdrawal agreement with the E.U. The withdrawal agreement was rejected by the U.K. Parliament on January 15, 2019, and the U.K. government is in the process of negotiating changes to the withdrawal agreement that would be acceptable to the U.K. Parliament and the E.U.  

We are continuing to prepare our European operations regardless of whether or not a withdrawal or transition agreement is reached. For example, we are taking steps to make changes to our European operations in an effort to ensure that we can continue to provide cross-border banking and investment and other services in E.U. Member States without the need for separate regulatory authorizations in each member state through the use of E.U. passporting arrangements, which allow for such cross-border activity. In the event that our U.K. licensed entities are unable to rely on E.U. passporting rights to provide services, we will adjust our operations in Europe to be able to carry out activities from within the E.U. These changes will include use of: a new licensed investment firm, Morgan Stanley Europe S.E., based in Germany, which will passport throughout the E.U. and serve E.U.-based clients where required; our existing German licensed bank, Morgan Stanley Bank AG, which will provide licensable banking activities where required; new licensed entities based in Ireland for licensable asset management activities; as well as branches of the previously noted entities in the E.U. and our existing regulated operations in France and Spain. We are continuing to build out the capabilities of these entities, including engagement with clients and local regulators. We also expect to add personnel to certain of our existing offices in the E.U.  

However, given the present political uncertainty, it is currently unclear what the final post-Brexit structure of our European operations will be. For a further discussion of the potential impact of the U.K.s withdrawal from the E.U. on our operations, see Risk FactorsInternational Risk. For further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about RiskCredit RiskCountry Risk Exposure.

Expected Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates  

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR and replacements or reforms of other interest rate benchmarks, such as EURIBOR and EONIA (collectively, the IBORs). It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of such rates to alternative reference rates selected by these central bank committees and working groups and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms, will occur over the course of the next few years. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from the IBORs, including the potential or actual discontinuance of any IBOR publication, remains unclear, we are preparing to transition from the IBORs to these alternative reference rates.  

Our transition plan includes a number of key steps, including continued engagement with central bank and industry working groups and regulators, active client engagement, internal operational readiness, and risk management, among other things, to promote the transition to alternative reference rates.  

There remain, however, a number of unknown factors regarding the transition from the IBORs and/or interest rate benchmark reforms that could impact our business, including, for example, the pace of the transition to replacement or reformed rates, the specific terms and parameters for and market acceptance of the alternative reference rates, prices of and the liquidity of trading markets for products based on the alternative reference rates, and our ability to transition to and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates. For a further discussion of the various risks we face in connection with the expected replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks on our operations, see Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.
