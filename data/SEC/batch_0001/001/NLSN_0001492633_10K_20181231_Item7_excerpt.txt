Item 7.  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Introduction  

The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. Further, this report may contain material that includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect, when made, Nielsen’s current views with respect to current events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to Nielsen’s operations and business environment that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The terms “Company,” “Nielsen,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein, refer to Nielsen Holdings plc and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise stated or indicated by context.  

Background and Executive Summary  

We are a leading global measurement and data analytics company that provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of consumers and consumer behavior. We deliver critical media and marketing information, analytics and industry expertise about what consumers buy (referred to herein as “Buy”) and what consumers watch and listen to (consumer interaction across the television, radio, digital and mobile viewing and listening platforms referred to herein as “Watch”) on a global and local basis. Our measurement and analytical services help our clients maintain and strengthen their market positions and identify opportunities for profitable growth. We have a presence in more than 100 countries, including many emerging markets, and hold leading market positions in many of our services and geographies.  

We believe that important measures of our results of operations include revenue, operating income/(loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined below). Our long-term financial objectives include consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins. Accordingly, we are focused on geographic market and service offering expansion to drive revenue growth and improve operating efficiencies, including effective resource utilization, information technology leverage and overhead cost management.  

Our business strategy is built upon a model that has traditionally yielded consistent revenue performance. Typically, before the start of each year, more than 70% of our annual revenue has been committed under contracts in our combined Buy and Watch segments, which provides us with a greater degree of stability for our revenue and allows us to more effectively manage our profitability and cash flows. We continue to look for growth opportunities through global expansion, specifically within emerging markets, as well as through the cross-platform expansion of our analytical services and measurement services.  

In September 2018, we announced a broad review of strategic alternatives for the entire company and its businesses. This review process, which is being conducted with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, includes an assessment of a broad range of potential strategic alternatives including continuing to operate as a public company, independent company, a separation of either the Company’s Buy or Watch segment, or a sale of the Company. There can be no assurance that this review will result in a specific transaction or other strategic alternative. 

Our restructuring and other productivity initiatives have been and will continue to be focused on a combination of improving operating leverage through targeted cost-reduction programs, business process improvements and portfolio restructuring actions, while at the same time investing in key programs to enhance future growth opportunities. 

Achieving our business objectives requires us to manage a number of key risk areas. Our growth objective of geographic market and service expansion requires us to maintain the consistency and integrity of our information and underlying processes on a global scale, and to invest effectively our capital in technology and infrastructure to keep pace with our clients’ demands and our competitors. Core to managing these key risk areas is our commitment to data privacy and security as it drives our ability to deliver quality insights for our clients in line with evolving regulatory requirements and governing standards across all the geographies and industries in which we operate. Our operating footprint across more than 100 countries requires disciplined global and local resource management of internal and third party providers to ensure success. In addition, our high level of indebtedness requires active management of our debt profile, with a focus on underlying maturities, interest rate risk, liquidity and operating cash flows.

Business Segment Overview  

We align our business into two reporting segments: what consumers buy (consumer purchasing measurement and analytics), and what consumers watch and listen to (media audience measurement and analytics). Our Buy and Watch segments are built on a foundation of proprietary data assets that are designed to yield essential insights for our clients to successfully measure, analyze and grow their businesses. 

Our Buy segment provides measurement services, which include our core tracking and scan data (primarily transactional measurement data and consumer behavior information), and analytical services to businesses in the consumer packaged goods industry. Our services also enable our clients to better manage their brands, uncover new sources of demand, launch and grow new products, analyze their sales, improve their marketing mix and establish more effective consumer relationships. Our data is used by our clients to measure their market share, tracking billions of sales transactions per month in retail outlets around the world. Our extensive database of retail and consumer information, combined with our advanced analytical capabilities, helps generate strategic insights that influence our clients’ key business decisions. Within our Buy segment, we have two primary geographic groups, developed and emerging markets. Developed markets primarily include the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and South Korea while emerging markets primarily include Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, India and Southeast Asia. 

Our Watch segment provides viewership and listening data and analytics primarily to the media and advertising industries for television, radio, digital and mobile viewing and listening platforms. Our Watch data is used by our media clients to understand their audiences, establish the value of their advertising inventory and maximize the value of their content, and by our advertising clients to plan and optimize their spending. 

Certain corporate costs, other than those described above, including those related to selling, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology systems, are considered operating costs and are allocated to our segments based on either the actual amount of costs incurred or on a basis consistent with the operations of the underlying segment.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The most significant of these policies relate to: revenue recognition; business combinations including purchase price allocations; accruals for pension costs and other post-retirement benefits; accounting for income taxes; and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computer software and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the valuation of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a summary of the significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 – “Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” – to our consolidated financial statements.  

Revenue Recognition  

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. The ASC has been applied to all contracts as of the date of adoption. There was no impact on our financial statements as a result of this adoption. 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from information (primarily retail measurement and consumer panel services) and measurement (primarily from television, radio, internet and mobile audiences) services. We recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, which generally occurs over time. Substantially all of our customer contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable. 

The following is a description of principal activities, by reportable segment, from which we generate our revenues. 

Revenues from the Buy segment consist primarily of retail measurement services, which provide market share, competitive sales volumes and insights into such activities as distribution, pricing, merchandising and promotion, and consumer panel services, which provide clients with insights into shopper behavior such as trial and repeat purchase for new products and likely substitutes as well as  

33 

customer segmentation. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied and control of the service is transferred to the customer. 

We also provide consumer intelligence and analytical services that help clients make smarter business decisions throughout their product development and marketing cycles. Our performance under these arrangements does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and generally includes an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. As such, revenue for these services is typically recognized over time. Revenue for contracts that do not include an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied, generally upon delivery of the service, and control of the service is transferred to the customer. 

Revenue from our Watch segment is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile measurement services which are used by our clients to establish the value of airtime and more effectively schedule and promote their programming. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied and control of the services are transferred to the customer. 

We enter into cooperation arrangements with certain of our customers, under which a customer provides us with its data in exchange for our services. We record these transactions at fair value, which is determined based on the fair value of goods or services received, if reasonably estimable. If not reasonably estimable we consider the fair value of the goods or services surrendered. 

Share-based Compensation 

Expense Recognition  

Our share-based compensation programs are comprised of stock options, performance-based stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance restricted stock units. We measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options, at fair value on the grant date and recognize such costs within the consolidated statements of operations; however, no expense is recognized for share-based payments that do not ultimately vest. We recognize expense associated with share-based payments that vest upon a single date using the straight-line method. For those that vest over time, an accelerated graded vesting is used. We recorded $35 million, $45 million and $51 million of expense associated with share-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate grant date fair value of all outstanding vested and unvested options was $23 million and $7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate grant date fair value of all outstanding vested and unvested performance stock options was zero and $8 million, respectively.  

As of December 31, 2018, the following amounts of unearned share-based compensation (net of estimated forfeitures) are expected to be recognized: approximately $2 million related to stock options over the next three years, approximately $6 million related to performance stock options over the next three years, approximately $61 million related to unvested RSUs over a weighted average period of 3.1 years and approximately $1 million related to performance restricted stock units over the next two years.  

Fair Value Measurement  

Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment. Share-based compensation expense for time-based stock options is primarily based on the estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which considers factors such as estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock, and the number of share-based awards expected to be forfeited due to future terminations. Some of the critical assumptions used in estimating the grant date fair value are presented in the table below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

34 

Under the Stock Incentive Plan, we granted time and performance based stock options to purchase shares during the year ended December 31, 2018. Share-based compensation expense for the time and performance based stock options is based on the Monte Carlo simulation model which considers factors such as estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock, and the number of share-based awards expected to be forfeited due to future terminations. Some of the critical assumptions used in estimating the grant date fair value are presented in the table below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted, which we believe are representative of future behavior. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, expected volatility was based on our historical volatility.  

In addition, for share-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals. The total number of performance restricted share units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period. For the 2018 award, twenty five percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s revenue compounded annual growth rate achievements, twenty five percent of the target award will be based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and fifty percent of the award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements. For the 2017 and 2016 awards, forty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and sixty percent of the target award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements. The maximum payout is 200% of target. The fair value of the target awards related to free cash flow and compounded annual growth rate was the fair value on the date of the grant, and the fair value of the target awards related to relative shareholder return was based on the Monte Carlo simulation model. Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material effect on our financial results.  

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates and, although we believe them to be reasonable, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value. 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.  

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names and trademarks, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. We have designated October 1st as the date in which the annual assessment is performed as this timing corresponds with the development of our formal budget and business plan review. We review the recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their respective carrying amounts. We established, and continue to evaluate, our reporting units based on our internal reporting structure and define such reporting units at our operating segment level or one level below. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily by an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis and supplemented by a market-based approach.  

35 

A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside of the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment. The following assumptions are significant to our discounted cash flow analysis:  

•  

Business projections – expected future cash flows and growth rates are based on assumptions about the level of business activity in the marketplace as well as applicable cost levels that drive our budget and business plans. The budget and business plans are updated at least annually and are frequently reviewed by management and our Board of Directors. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions and a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future. Should such events or circumstances arise, management would evaluate other options available at that time that, if executed, could result in future profitability.  

•  

Long-term growth rates – the assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit’s earnings stream, beyond that of the budget and business plan period, is projected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value, or value at the end of the future earnings stream, of our reporting units, and are added to the cash flows projected for the budget and business plan period. The long-term growth rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit such as the maturity of the underlying services. The long-term growth rates we used for each of our reporting units in our 2018 evaluation were between 2.0% and 2.5%.  

•  

Discount rates – the reporting unit’s combined future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be used by market participants. The weighted-average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. The discount rates we used in our 2018 evaluation of our reporting units were between 9.25% and 11.25%.  

These estimates and assumptions vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period.  

We also use a market-based approach in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings, next year’s revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions.  

To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our enterprise market capitalization. Enterprise market capitalization includes, among other factors, the market value of our common stock and the appropriate redemption values of our debt.  

The following table summarizes the results of the three reporting units that were subject to the October 1, 2018 annual impairment testing and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units for (a) fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10%, (b) fair values exceeding carrying values between 10% and 20%, and (c) fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20%. The table below represents the reporting units goodwill balances as of December 31, 2018. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2018, in connection with our quarterly forecasting cycle, we updated the forecasted operating results for each of the businesses based on the most recent financial results and best estimates of future operations. The updated forecasts reflected a decline in near-term revenue growth and profitability, primarily in our Buy business. Accordingly, in connection with the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2018, we performed an updated impairment analysis. Based on this analysis, we concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was in excess of carrying value as of such date. Therefore, management concluded it was not more-likely-than-not that an impairment had occurred. However, the fair value of one of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, compared to greater than 20%  

36 

during our last annual impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2017. We also concluded that the fair value of other indefinite-lived assets exceeded carrying value. Furthermore, based on the operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2018, management similarly concluded it was not more-likely-than-not that an impairment had occurred. However, we indicated at that time that should operating results decline versus management’s latest forecast for any reason, including if the Buy business results do not meet current expectations or should our recently announced review of strategic alternatives lead to changes in investment strategies, then goodwill may be at risk for impairment in the future.  

We performed our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2018. Based on the results of our testing, the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values except for the Buy reporting unit. With respect to the Buy reporting unit, ongoing challenging conditions in its operating environment and our review and analysis of strategic alternatives have resulted in downward revisions of management’s forecasts on future projected earnings and cash flows. Given these declines and overall market conditions, we reassessed the market comparable data inputs used in the market-based approach and selected the lower end of the range of indicative industry multiples. Additionally, such conditions resulted in the use of a higher discount rate in our valuation. As a result of all of these factors, the fair value calculated was less than the carrying value and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,411 million for our Buy reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2018.  

We perform sensitivity analyses on our assumptions, primarily around both long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions. Our sensitivity analyses include several combinations of reasonably possible scenarios with regard to these assumptions, including a one percent movement in both our long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions. When applying both a one percent decrease in the long-term growth rate and a one percent increase in the discount rate assumptions, the estimated fair value was less than the underlying carrying value for certain of our reporting units. Even though our sensitivity analyses, based upon reasonably possible adverse changes in assumptions, showed a potential shortfall, management believes that it has the ability to execute certain productivity and other actions in order to increase the results of operations and cash flows of our reporting units. We will continue to closely evaluate the assumptions both qualitatively and quantitatively and appropriately report on any indicators of future impairments. While management believes that these sensitivity analyses provide a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the recovery of Nielsen’s goodwill, other facts or circumstances may arise that could impact the impairment assessment and therefore these analyses should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment. 

The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace. There was no impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets. 

Pension Costs  

We provide a number of retirement benefits to our employees, including defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans. Pension costs, in respect of defined benefit pension plans, primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets. Differences between this expected return and the actual return on these plan assets and actuarial changes are not recognized in the statement of operations, unless the accumulated differences and changes exceed a certain threshold. The excess is amortized and charged to the statement of operations over, at the maximum, the average remaining term of employee service. We recognize obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans as expenses in the statement of operations as they are incurred.  

The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models. In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the assumed rate of compensation increases. We provide retiree medical benefits to a limited number of participants in the U.S. Therefore, retiree medical care cost trend rates are not a significant driver of our post retirement costs. Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates. Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary.  

The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. For the Dutch and other non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans. 

37 

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components. For our U.S. plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year. A similar 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal Dutch plans by approximately $3 million per year. We assumed that the weighted-averages of long-term returns on our pension plans were 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018, 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets. The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption. Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting our expected return on plan assets. As such, there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts.  

Income Taxes  

We have a presence in more than 100 countries, and our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in where or how we do business, acquisitions or dispositions, audit-related developments, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Additionally, our effective tax rate can fluctuate based on the level of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. 

We have completed a number of material acquisitions and divestitures which have generated complex tax issues requiring management to use its judgment to make various tax determinations. We have sought to organize the affairs of our subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner, taking into consideration the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we are confident that tax returns have been appropriately prepared and filed, there is risk that additional tax may be assessed on certain transactions or that the deductibility of certain expenditures may be disallowed for tax purposes. Our policy is to estimate tax risk to the best of our ability and provide accordingly for those risks and take positions in which a high degree of confidence exists that the tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authorities. The policy with respect to deferred taxation is to provide in full for temporary differences using the liability method. 

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are computed by assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The carrying value of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to the extent that these deferred tax assets are not considered to be realized on a more likely than not basis. Realization of deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our judgment and various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, our ability to generate future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen and potential tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly changed the way the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and created a territorial-style taxing system. The TCJA also required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and also created new taxes on certain types of foreign earnings. We are subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. In December of 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the TCJA but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements. The guidance in SAB 118 also allows companies to adjust the provisional amounts during a one year measurement period which is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As of December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the (a) effects on our existing deferred tax balances, and (b) the one-time transition tax. We finalized our accounting for the TCJA in December of 2018 and our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 results of operations reflect, in accordance with SAB 118, a reduction in tax expense of $252 million as an adjustment to the 2017 provisional expense. In addition, as a result of an election made by the Company, the tax payable associated with the one-time transition tax is payable over eight years; therefore the tax payable deemed long term in nature of $36 million is represented within other non-current liabilities. See Note 14, Income Taxes for additional details. 

We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Long-Lived Assets  

We are required to assess whether the value of our long-lived assets, including our buildings, improvements, technical and other equipment, and amortizable intangible assets have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. We do not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist. If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method. The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires us to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change.  

We capitalize software development costs with respect to major internal use software initiatives or enhancements. The costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed, and we consider it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use. Once the software is placed in service, the capitalized costs are generally amortized over periods of three to seven years. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered, a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and as our assessments change. The Company’s impairment assessments resulted in the recognition of a non-cash self-developed software asset impairment charge of $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. No impairment indicators were noted for other long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 

Factors Affecting Nielsen’s Financial Results  

Acquisitions, Dispositions and Investments in Affiliates  

Acquisitions 

On February 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Gracenote Inc., Gracenote Canada, Inc., Gracenote Netherlands Holdings B.V., Tribune Digital Ventures, LLC, and Tribune International Holdco, LLC (each, a “Gracenote Company” and together “Gracenote”) through the purchase of 100% of each Gracenote Company’s outstanding common stock from Tribune Media Company for a total purchase price of $585 million. We acquired the data and technology that underpins the programming guides and personalized user experience for major video, music, audio and sports content. This acquisition expands our footprint with major clients including Gracenote’s global content database which spans across platforms including multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD’s), smart television, streaming music services, connected devices, media players and in-car infotainment systems.  

We incurred acquisition-related expenses of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of transaction fees, legal, accounting and other professional services that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. 

The following unaudited pro forma information presents the consolidated results of operations of us and Gracenote for the year ended December 31, 2017, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2016, with pro forma adjustments to give effect to amortization of intangible assets, an increase in interest expense from acquisition financing, and certain other adjustments:

Other Acquisitions 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid cash consideration of $43 million associated with current period acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Had these 2018 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2018, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.  

For the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding Gracenote, we paid cash consideration of $210 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Had these 2017 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2017, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.  

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid cash consideration of $285 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Had these 2016 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2016, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.  

Income Taxes 

The TCJA was enacted in December of 2017 and significantly changed the way the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA reduced The U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and created a territorial-style taxing system. The TCJA also required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and also created new taxes on certain types of foreign earnings. We are subject to the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. In December of 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 which provides that companies that have not completed their accounting for the effects of the TCJA but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements. The guidance in SAB 118 also allows companies to adjust the provisional amounts during a one year measurement period which is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As of December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the (a) effects on our existing deferred tax balances, and (b) the one-time transition tax. We finalized our accounting for the TCJA in December of 2018 and our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 results of operations reflect, in accordance with SAB 118, a reduction in tax expense of a $252 million as an adjustment to the 2017 provisional expense. In addition, as a result of an election made by the Company, the tax payable associated with the one-time transition tax is payable over eight years; therefore the tax payable deemed long term in nature of $36 million is represented within other non-current liabilities. See Footnote 14 Income Taxes for additional details.  

Foreign Currency  

Our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars and are therefore subject to the impact of movements in exchange rates on the translation of the financial information of individual businesses whose functional currencies are other than U.S. dollars. Our principal foreign exchange revenue exposure is spread across several currencies, primarily the Euro. The table below sets forth the profile of our revenue by principal currency.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact our operating results. Impacts associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates; revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange. The average U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.18 to €1.00, $1.13 to €1.00 and $1.11 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Constant currency growth rates used in the following discussion of results of operations eliminate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations.  

We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of year-over-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations,  

40 

thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the Company’s performance. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results. This calculation may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and, accordingly, the constant currency presentation is not meant to be a substitution for recorded amounts presented in conformity with GAAP nor should such amounts be considered in isolation.  

Operations in Argentina 

We have operations in both the Buy and Watch segments in Argentina and the functional currency for those operations is the Argentine Peso. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Argentina’s currency has been considered hyperinflationary since July 1, 2018, and, accordingly, local currency transactions have been denominated in U.S. dollars since July 1, 2018, and will continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars until Argentina’s currency is no longer deemed to be hyperinflationary. We will continue to assess the appropriate conversion rate based on events in Argentina and our Argentina operations. This event has had an immaterial impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016  

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts included in our consolidated statements of operations:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from our consolidated statements of operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, share-based compensation expense and other non-operating items from our consolidated statements of operations as well as certain other items considered outside the normal course of our operations specifically described below. 

Restructuring charges: We exclude restructuring expenses, which primarily include employee severance, office consolidation and contract termination charges, from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. By excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures, we are better able to evaluate our ability to utilize our existing assets and estimate the long-term value these assets will generate for us. Furthermore, we believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. 

Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets: We exclude the impact of charges related to the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Given the significance of the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, we reported it separately in the consolidated statements of operations. We believe that the exclusion of these impairments, which are non-cash, allows for meaningful comparisons of operating results to peer companies. We believe that this increases period-to-period comparability and is useful to evaluate the performance of the total company. 

41 

Share-based compensation expense: We exclude the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation. Due to the subjective assumptions and a variety of award types, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense, which is typically non-cash, allows for more meaningful comparisons of our operating results to peer companies. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. 

Other non-operating income/(expense), net: We exclude foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses, primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements, as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses recorded on business combinations or dispositions, sales of investments, net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and early redemption payments made in connection with debt refinancing. We believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. 

Other items: To measure operating performance, we exclude certain expenses and gains that arise outside the ordinary course of our operations. Such costs primarily include legal settlements, acquisition related expenses, business optimization costs and other transactional costs. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and the users of the financial statements to better understand our financial results. 

Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period expressed as a percentage of revenues for that period. 

We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA being a significant measure of performance for management purposes, we also believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.  

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may, therefore, have limitations as a comparative analytical tool. 

The below table presents a reconciliation from net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, other items primarily consist of business optimization costs, including strategic review costs, and transaction related costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other items primarily consist of transaction related costs and business optimization costs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other items primarily consist of business optimization costs.

Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017  

Revenues  

Revenues decreased 0.9% to $6,515 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $6,572 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 0.7% on a constant currency basis. Revenues within our Buy segment decreased 4.1%, or 3.7% on a constant currency basis. Revenues within our Watch segment increased 2.3%, or 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Refer to the “Business Segment Results” section for further discussion of our revenue performance. 

Cost of Revenues, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  

Cost of revenues increased 1.4% on reported and constant currency basis to $2,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Costs within our Buy segment increased 3.6% on a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to the continued global investment in our services, including retailer investments.  

Costs within our Watch segment increased 0.4%, or 0.3% on a constant currency basis. Cost of revenues increased primarily due to the impact of our investments and higher spending on product portfolio management initiatives, including our digital and Marketing Effectiveness product offerings, partially offset by productivity initiatives. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.5% to $1,958 for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1,873 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. 

Costs within our Buy segment decreased 1.0% on a reported and constant currency basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to productivity initiatives.  

Costs within our Watch segment increased 11.4%, or 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of our investments. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expense was $675 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $640 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with higher capital expenditures. 

Depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations increased to $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Impairment of Goodwill and other Long-Lived Assets 

During 2018, we recorded an impairment of goodwill and other long-lived asset charge of $1,413 million, primarily related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,411 million. This charge was recorded primarily within our Buy reporting unit.  

Restructuring Charges  

We recorded $139 million and $80 million in restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance costs associated with our plans to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses and consolidate operations centers, as well as automation initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Operating Income/(loss)  

Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $475 million compared to operating income of $1,214 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating loss within our Buy segment decreased to $1,342 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from operating income of $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income within our Watch segment decreased to $1,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1,034 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Corporate operating expenses increased to $143 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

43 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense was $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $374 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher USD LIBOR interest rates on our senior secured term loans without hedged positions. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gains/(Losses), Net  

Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results. The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.18 to €1.00 and $1.13 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

We realized net losses of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions. 

We realized net losses of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions. 

Other Income/(Expense), Net  

Other expense, net of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily related to certain costs incurred in connection with the June 2018 debt refinancing discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, as well as the write-off of certain previously capitalized deferred financing fees in conjunction with the refinancing, partially offset by certain pension related amounts reclassified from operating expense as a result of our adoption of ASU “ Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” See “Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for more information. 

Other expense, net of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to the finalization of working capital and other matters associated with dispositions, partially offset by certain pension related amounts reclassified from operating expense as a result of our adoption of ASU “Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” See “Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for more information.  

Income/(Loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Affiliates  

Loss was $882 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income of $828 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above.  

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 21% and 47%, respectively. 

Our effective tax rate benefit of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the TCJA and an intercompany restructuring. Those impacts are described further in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of goodwill impairment, tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions, and increases in valuation allowances offset by the favorable impact of the TCJA adjustments, certain financing activities, and intercompany restructuring. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of the TCJA as well as tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, offset by the favorable impact of certain financing activities and releases of valuation allowances. 

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $572 million and $452 million, respectively. We also have accrued interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 of $70 million and $53 million, respectively. 

44 

Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of our provision or benefit for income taxes. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties. Furthermore, the amounts ultimately paid may differ from the amounts accrued. An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.  

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are lower and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are higher, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Other factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to, losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can be recognized, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determined that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized, and audits by taxing authorities. 

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.6% to $1,850 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2,024 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 28.40% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 30.80% for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016” for the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.  

Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016  

Revenues  

Revenues increased 4.2% to $6,572 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $6,309 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or an increase of 3.8% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.4% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues within our Buy segment decreased 2.7%, or 3.3% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues within our Watch segment increased 11.9%, or 11.7% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Refer to the “Business Segment Results” section for further discussion of our revenue performance. 

Cost of Revenues, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  

Cost of revenues increased 6.1% to $2,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2,607 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or an increase of 5.7% on a constant currency basis.  

Costs within our Buy segment increased 0.7%, or 0.1% on a constant currency basis. Cost of revenues increased primarily due to the continued global investment in our services.  

Costs within our Watch segment increased 11.2% on a reported and constant currency basis. Cost of revenues increased primarily due to the impact of the Gracenote acquisition. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5% to $1,873 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1,864 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 0.4% on a constant currency basis. 

Costs within our Buy segment decreased 5.8%, or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to productivity initiatives including dispositions as we continue to execute our portfolio pruning initiatives.  

Costs within our Watch segment increased 16.8%, or 16.6% on a constant currency basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of the Gracenote acquisition. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expense was $640 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $603 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangible assets acquired as part of the Gracenote acquisition on February 1, 2017. 

45 

Depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations increased to $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Restructuring Charges  

We recorded $80 million and $105 million in restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance associated with productivity initiatives and contract termination costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Operating Income/(Loss) 

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,214 million compared to operating income of $1,130 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating income within our Buy segment decreased to $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $327 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating income within our Watch segment increased to $1,034 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $931 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Corporate operating expenses increased to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense was $374 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $333 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily related to higher average debt balances including the incurrence of an additional $500 million 5.00% Senior Notes in January 2017 and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gains/(Losses), Net  

Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results. The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.13 to €1.00 and $1.11 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

We realized net losses of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions. 

We realized net losses of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions and the loss of $5 million from the revaluation of our U.S.-denominated debt and cash held in EURO functional entities, partially offset by a gain of $1 million associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments. 

Other Income/(expense), Net  

Other expense, net of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to the finalization of working capital and other matters associated with dispositions partially offset by certain pension related amounts reclassified from operating expense as a result of our adoption of ASU “Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” See “Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for more information. 

Other income, net of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily related to the gain of $14 million on the dispositions and certain pension related amounts reclassified from operating expense as a result of our adoption of ASU “ Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” See “Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for more information, partially offset by the loss of $4 million related to certain costs incurred in connection with the B-3 term loan refinancing.  

Income/(Loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Affiliates  

Income was $828 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $816 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above.  

46 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 47% and 38%, respectively.  

Our effective tax rate of 47% for the year ended December 31, 2017 was significantly impacted by the TCJA. Those impacts are described further in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of the TCJA as well as tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, offset by the favorable impact of certain financing activities and releases of valuation allowances. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, offset by the favorable impact of certain financing activities, windfall tax benefits from stock option exercises and releases of uncertain tax positions. 

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $452 million and $432 million, respectively. We also have accrued interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $53 million and $33 million, respectively. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of our provision or benefit for income taxes 

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.1% to $2,024 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1,925 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 30.80% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 30.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016” for the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.  

Business Segment Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017  

Revenues  

The table below sets forth our segment revenue performance data for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, both on an as-reported and constant currency basis.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Buy Segment Revenues  

Revenues decreased 4.1% to $3,097 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3,231 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 3.7% on a constant currency basis.  

47 

Revenues from emerging markets decreased 1.6% to $1,145 million, or an increase of 2.0% on a constant currency basis. The increase on a constant currency basis was driven primarily due to our global footprint, coverage expansion and broad product offerings driving growth in Eastern Europe, Africa and some markets in Latin America, partially offset by pressure on multinational client spend and continued softness in China. 

Revenues from developed markets decreased 3.9% to $1,922 million, or 5.1% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to continued pressure on spending from large multinational clients and continued pressure in the fast moving consumer goods industry in the U.S. 

Revenues from Corporate Buy decreased 55.9% to $30 million on a reported and constant currency basis. Corporate includes slow growth and non-core services that are part of portfolio pruning initiatives.  

Watch Segment Revenues  

Revenues increased 2.3% to $3,418 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3,341 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 or an increase of 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Audience Measurement of Video and Text, which increased 6.0%, or 5.8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to continued client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement system and our ongoing investments, including Gracenote. Audio revenues decreased 0.8% or 0.6% on a constant currency basis. Marketing Effectiveness revenue decreased 3.7%, or 4.0% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by historical data sales related to a product category exit, partially offset by consistent investment in our product portfolio. Corporate/Other Watch revenues decreased by 24.2%, or 23.8% on a constant currency basis due to our continued exit of non-core media analytics products. Our Core Watch revenue grew 3.8%, or 3.7% on a constant currency basis.  

48 

Business Segment Profitability  

We do not allocate items below operating income/(loss) to our business segments and therefore the tables below set forth a reconciliation of operating income/(loss) at the business segment level for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, adjusting for certain items affecting operating income/(loss), such as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and certain other items described below resulting in a presentation of our non-GAAP business segment profitability. Non-GAAP business segment profitability provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations. When this non-GAAP financial information is viewed with our GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. It is important to note that the non-GAAP business segment profitability corresponds in total to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA described within our consolidated results of operations above, which our chief operating decision maker and other members of management use to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and have important limitations as analytical tools. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Buy Segment Profitability  

Operating loss was $1,342 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to operating income of $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was driven by the revenue performance discussed above, the Buy goodwill impairment, higher restructuring costs, higher depreciation and amortization expense and our continued global investments in our services, including retailer investments. Non-GAAP business segment income decreased 27.8% on a constant currency basis.

Watch Segment Profitability  

Operating income was $1,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,034 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was driven by higher restructuring costs, higher depreciation and amortization expense and investments in our services, partially offset by the revenue performance discussed above. Non-GAAP business segment income was flat on a constant currency basis. 

Corporate Expenses and Eliminations  

Operating expenses were $143 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in transaction related costs and business optimization costs and depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower restructuring charges.  

Business Segment Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016  

Revenues  

The table below sets forth our segment revenue performance data for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, both on an as-reported and constant currency basis.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Buy Segment Revenues  

Revenues decreased 2.7% to $3,231 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3,322 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 3.3% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  

Revenues from emerging markets increased 9.5% to $1,164 million, or an increase of 8.8% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue growth was driven by our global footprint, coverage expansion and broad product offerings which continue to position us well with both local and multinational clients. For the year ended December 31, 2017, these investments drove double-digit growth in Latin America, India and Eastern Europe along with high single-digit growth in South East Asia and Africa. 

Revenues from developed markets decreased 4.6% to $1,999 million, or 5.2% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues decreased as a result of softness in the U.S. partially offset by growth in our European developed markets. 

Revenues from Corporate Buy decreased 58.3% to $68 million on a reported and constant currency basis. Corporate includes slow growth and non-core services that are part of portfolio pruning initiatives.  

50 

Watch Segment Revenues  

Revenues increased 11.9% to $3,341 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2,987 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 or an increase of 11.7% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the Gracenote acquisition, revenues increased 4.7% (4.5% on a constant currency basis). Excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Audience Measurement of Video and Text, which increased 16.7% (16.3% on a constant currency basis). Excluding the Gracenote acquisition, Audience Measurement of Video and Text revenues increased 5.8% (5.5% on a constant currency basis), due to our ongoing investments and continued client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement initiative. Audio revenues increased 0.2% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our Marketing Effectiveness revenue grew 22.0% (21.1% on a constant currency basis), due to the continued strength in audience-based solutions, including data deliveries, that help advertisers and publishers measure the return on investment in media spend and investments in our product portfolio. Corporate/Other Watch revenues decreased by 18.0% (16.5% on a constant currency basis) due to our continued exit of non-core media analytics products. Our Core Watch revenue grew 14.2% (13.9% on a constant currency basis). Excluding the Gracenote acquisition, our Core Watch revenue grew 6.5% (6.2% on a constant currency basis).

Buy Segment Profitability  

Operating income was $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $327 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by the revenue performance discussed above, partially offset by lower restructuring charges. Non-GAAP business segment income decreased 7.2% on a constant currency basis. 

Watch Segment Profitability  

Operating income was $1,034 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $931 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by the revenue performance discussed above, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. Non-GAAP business segment income increased 10.0% on a constant currency basis. 

Corporate Expenses and Eliminations  

Operating expenses were $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in transaction related costs and business optimization costs partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges and share-based compensation expense.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash flows from operations provided a source of funds of $1,058 million, $1,310 million and $1,296 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease in 2018 was driven primarily by the Adjusted EBITDA performance discussed above, higher interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the full year impact of a 2017 bond issuance and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates, partially offset by lower tax payments.  

We provide for additional liquidity through several sources, including maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources and a committed revolving credit facility. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Of the $524 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, approximately $419 million was held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. We regularly review the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. to determine the amounts necessary to fund the current operations of our foreign operations and their growth initiatives and amounts needed to service our U.S. indebtedness and related obligations.  

The below table illustrates our weighted average interest rate and cash paid for interest over the last three years. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

52 

Our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant. We believe we will have available resources to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including our senior secured debt service. We expect the cash flow from our operations, combined with existing cash and amounts available under the revolving credit facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, restructuring obligations, dividend payments and capital spending over the next year. In addition, we may, from time to time, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities) in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. 

Long-term borrowings  

The following table provides a summary of our outstanding long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Term Loan Facilities  

In June 2018, we entered into an Amendment Agreement to amend and restate our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) in the form of the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”). Among other things, the Amendment Agreement provided for: (i) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility with a new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility having commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $850,000,000; (ii) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Class A Term Loans with new Class A Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,125,000,000; (iii) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Class B-2 Euro Term Loans with new Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of € 545,245,518; and (iv) incurring incremental term loans in the form of Class B-4 Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $75,000,000. 

The proceeds of loans under each replacement facility were used to replace or refinance the entire outstanding principal amount of loans under the prior facility that was replaced, and the proceeds of the incremental Class B-4 Term Loans, together with a portion of the proceeds of the Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in excess of the amount of the prior Class B-2 Euro Term Loans that were replaced, were used to prepay the amount of prior Class A Term Loans in excess of the amount of new Class A Term Loans. 

53 

The new Class A Term Loans will mature in full on July 9, 2023 and are required to be repaid in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.63% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the first eight quarters following the effective date of the Amendment Agreement, 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the subsequent eight quarters and 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the subsequent three quarters, with the balance payable on July 9, 2023. The new Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will mature in full on October 4, 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Class B-2 Euro Term Loans, with the balance payable on October 4, 2023. The Class B-4 Term Loans will mature in full on October 4, 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Class B-4 Term Loans, with the balance payable on October 4, 2023. The new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 9, 2023. 

The new Class A Term Loans and loans under the new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i) a base rate or eurocurrency rate, plus (ii) an applicable margin determined by reference to the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), which varies from 0.25% to 1.00%, in the case of base rate loans, and from 1.25% to 2.00%, in the case of eurocurrency rate loans. The Class B-2 Euro Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) a eurocurrency rate plus (ii) an applicable margin equal to 2.50%. The Class B-4 Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i) a base rate or eurocurrency rate, plus (ii) an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.00%, in the case of eurocurrency loans, or 1.00%, in the case of base rate loans. 

The Amended Credit Agreement contains substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants as those of the Prior Credit Agreement, except the exceptions to the restrictions on restricted payments and investments that are determined by reference to the Total Leverage Ratio were amended to increase the applicable limits. 

Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by TNC B.V., substantially all of the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and are secured by substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the guarantors, the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and up to 65% of the capital stock of certain of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. Under a separate security agreement, substantially all of the assets of TNC B.V. are pledged as collateral for amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. 

Covenants  

The Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. and its restricted subsidiaries (which together constitute most of our subsidiaries) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make certain loans and investments, declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness, sell certain assets, transact with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions and alter the business they conduct. These entities are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, in their ability to transfer their net assets to us. Such restricted net assets amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at December 31, 2018. In addition, these entities are subject to a total leverage covenant. The leverage ratio requires that we not permit the ratio of total net debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at the end of any calendar quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specified threshold. The maximum permitted ratio is 5.50 to 1.00. Neither we nor TNC B.V. is currently bound by any financial or negative covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. Certain significant financial covenants are described further below. 

Failure to comply with this financial covenant would result in an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement unless waived by certain of our term lenders and our revolving lenders. An event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement can result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the facilities, which in turn would result in an event of default and possible acceleration of indebtedness under the agreements governing our debt securities as well. As our failure to comply with the financial covenant described above can cause us to go into default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, management believes that our Amended Credit Agreement and this covenant are material to us. As of December 31, 2018, we were in full compliance with the financial covenant described above.  

Pursuant to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are subject to making mandatory prepayments on the term loans within our Amended Credit Agreement to the extent in any full calendar year we generate Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The percentage of ECF that must be applied as a repayment is a function of several factors, including our ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA, as well other adjustments, including any voluntary term loan repayments made in the course of the calendar year. To the extent any mandatory repayment is required pursuant to this ECF clause; such payment must generally occur  

54 

on or around the time of the delivery of the annual consolidated financial statements to the lenders. At December 31, 2018, our ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA was less than 5.00 to 1.00 and therefore no mandatory repayment was required. Our next ECF measurement date will occur upon completion of the 2019 results, and although we do not expect to be required to issue any mandatory repayments in 2018 or beyond, it is uncertain at this time if any such payments will be required in future periods.  

Revolving Credit Facility  

The Amended Credit Agreement contains a senior secured revolving credit facility with aggregate revolving credit commitments of $850 million and a final maturity of July 2023 under which Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings, Inc., and Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. can borrow revolving loans. The revolving credit facility can also be used for letters of credit, guarantees and swingline loans. 

The senior secured revolving credit facility is provided under the Amended Credit Agreement and so contains covenants and restrictions as noted above with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement. Obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement.  

As of December 31, 2018, we had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $16 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $13 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $834 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.  

Debenture Loans  

The indentures governing certain of our debenture loans limit the majority of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, use assets as security in other transactions and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies subject to certain exceptions. Upon a change in control, we are required to make an offer to redeem all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the 101% of the aggregate accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nielsen Holdings plc, substantially all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Nielsen Holdings plc, and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen Holdings plc.  

Dividends and Share Repurchase Program 

We remain committed to driving shareholder value as evidenced in 2013 with the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy by our Board of Directors, under which we have paid $494 million and $474 million in cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to the Board of Directors’ continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders, and are in compliance with all laws and agreements to which we are subject. The below table summarizes the dividends declared on our common stock during 2017 and 2018. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On February 21, 2019, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our common stock. The dividend is payable on March 21, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2019. 

55 

Our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, as included in the below table, for up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock. The primary purposes of the program are to return value to shareholders and to mitigate dilution associated with our equity compensation plans. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Repurchases under these plans will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or otherwise depending on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. This program has been executed within the limitations of the authority granted by our shareholders.  

As of December 31, 2018, there have been 39,426,521 shares of our common stock purchased at an average price of $44.95 per share (total consideration of approximately $1,772 million) under this program. 

The activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of open market share repurchases and is summarized in the following table: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash Flows 2018 versus 2017  

Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,058 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,310 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was driven primarily by the Adjusted EBITDA performance discussed above, higher interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the full year impact of a 2017 bond issuance and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates, partially offset by lower tax payments. Our key collections performance measure, days billing outstanding (DBO), stayed consistent for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  

Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $506 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,236 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased acquisition payments, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017.  

56 

Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $676 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to decreased net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018, higher dividend payments, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, and an increase in capital lease financing, partially offset by lower share repurchasing, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017.  

Cash Flows 2017 versus 2016  

Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,310 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,296 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by the Adjusted EBITDA performance discussed above and the $36 million cash contribution to the Nielsen Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by higher tax payments, and higher interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to higher debt balances and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates. Our key collections performance measure, days billing outstanding (DBO), stayed consistent for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a 3 day decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,236 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $642 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increased acquisition payments and capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016.  

Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower share repurchasing, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, partially offset by decreased net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2017, higher dividend payments, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, and an increase in capital lease financing during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period of 2016.  

Capital Expenditures  

Investments in property, plant, equipment, software and other assets totaled $520 million, $489 million and $433 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the Company received $4 million, $42 million and $42 million of proceeds from the sale of certain property, plant and equipment and other assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

Commitments and Contingencies  

Outsourced Services Agreements  

In October 2017, we amended and restated in its entirety, our Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2007, with Tata America International Corporation and Tata Consultancy Services Limited (jointly, “TCS”) (as amended prior to the Second Amendment and Restatement, the “Prior Agreement”) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “Agreement”), dated as of October 1, 2017 and effective as of January 1, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), with TCS. The term of the Agreement has been extended for an additional five years, so as to expire on December 31, 2025, with three one-year renewal options granted to us. We have committed to purchase services from TCS from the Effective Date through the remaining term of the Agreement (the “Minimum Commitment”) in the amount of $2.25 billion, including a commitment to purchase at least $320 million in services per year from 2017 through 2020, $186 million in services per year from 2021 through 2024, and $139.5 million in services in 2025 (in each of the foregoing cases, the “Annual Commitment”). We met the Minimum Commitment in 2018. In connection with the entry into the Agreement, the parties have agreed to terminate the separate Global Infrastructure Services Agreement between them as of the Effective Date and include the services provided thereunder in one or more Statements of Work (“SOWs”) arising under the Agreement. TCS’s charges under such SOWs will continue to be credited against the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment. TCS globally provides us with professional services relating to information technology (including application development and maintenance), business process outsourcing, client service knowledge process outsourcing, management sciences, analytics, and financial planning. As we order specific services under the Agreement, the parties will execute SOWs describing the specific scope of the services to be performed by TCS. The amount of the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment may be reduced on the occurrence of certain events, some of which also provide us with the right to terminate the Agreement or SOWs, as applicable. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining TCS commitment was approximately $1.6 billion. 

57 

Nielsen Foundation, Inc. 

In November 2015, we established the Nielsen Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”) for charitable, educational, scientific, and literary purposes including the making of distributions to organizations that qualify as tax exempt organizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The assets and transactions of the Foundation are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Donations to the Foundation are expensed when committed by us. In December 2015, our Board of Directors approved an unconditional donation of $36 million to the Foundation, at which time it was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. In March 2016, we paid the cash contribution to the Foundation.  

Other Contractual Obligations 

Our other contractual obligations include capital lease obligations (including interest portion), facility leases, leases of certain computer and other equipment, agreements to purchase data and telecommunication services, the payment of principal and interest on debt and pension fund obligations.  

At December 31, 2018, the minimum annual payments under these agreements and other contracts that had initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as listed in the following table. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax positions at December 31, 2018, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $641 million in uncertain tax positions (which includes interest and penalties of $70 million) have been excluded from the contractual obligations table below. See Note 14 – “Income Taxes” – to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Our short-term and long-term debt obligations, including capital lease and other financing obligations, are described in Note 11 – “Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” – to our consolidated financial statements.  

(b)  

Our operating lease obligations are described in Note 16 – “Commitments and Contingencies” – to our consolidated financial statements.  

(c)  

Other contractual obligations represent obligations under agreements, which are not unilaterally cancelable by us, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices. We generally require purchase orders for vendor and third party spending. The amounts presented above represent the minimum future annual services covered by purchase obligations including data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing. Our remaining commitments as of December 31, 2018, under the outsourced services agreement with TCS have been included above based on the Annual Commitment minimum required payments. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining TCS commitment was approximately $1.6 billion. 

(d)  

Interest payments consist of interest on both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt based on LIBOR as of December 31, 2018.

Our contributions to pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans were $29 million, $21 million and $21 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Future minimum pension and other post-retirement benefits contributions are not determinable for time periods after 2019. See Note 10 – “Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” – to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on plan obligations.

Guarantees and Other Contingent Commitments  

At December 31, 2018, we were committed under the following significant guarantee arrangements:  

Sub-lease guarantees. We provide sub-lease guarantees in accordance with certain agreements pursuant to which we guarantee all rental payments upon default of rental payment by the sub-lessee. To date, we have not been required to perform under such arrangements, and do not anticipate making any significant payments related to such guarantees and, accordingly, no amounts have been recorded.  

Letters of credit. Letters of credit issued and outstanding amount to $16 million at December 31, 2018.  

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies  

In August 2018, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants Nielsen, former Chief Executive Officer Dwight Mitchell Barns, and former Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson. Another lawsuit, which alleges similar facts but also names other defendants, including former Chief Operating Officer Stephen Hasker, was filed in the Northern District of Illinois in September 2018 and transferred to the Southern District of New York in December 2018. These lawsuits assert violations of certain provisions of the Exchange Act, based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements relating to the outlook of our Buy segment, our preparedness for changes in global data privacy laws and our reliance on third-party data. We expect that an amended or consolidated complaint relating to these cases will be filed after appointment of a lead plaintiff and intend to file a motion to dismiss the amended or consolidated complaint. In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of our current and former officers and directors. The derivative lawsuit alleges that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaints. The derivative lawsuit further alleges that certain officers and directors engaged in trading our stock based on material, nonpublic information. We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that their resolution is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations. 

We are also subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums. Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, we expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Except as disclosed above, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.  

Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue Recognition 

In May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The new revenue recognition standard provides a five step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The new model requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and is applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption if using the modified retrospective transition method. In addition, the new standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Except for the required financial statement disclosures, included in Note 3 –“Revenue Recognition” to the consolidated financial statements, there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost 

In March 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, “Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” which changes the presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to employer sponsored defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. Service cost is included within the same income statement  

59 

line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while other components of net periodic benefit pension cost is presented separately outside of operating income/(loss). Additionally, only service costs may be capitalized in assets. This ASU was adopted effective January 1, 2018 and was applied retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, we reclassified $11 million and $13 million from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income/(expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Other Income—Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets 

In February 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, “Other Income—Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets," which clarifies the scope and application of ASC 610-20 on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales. It requires the application of certain recognition and measurement principles in ASC 606 when derecognizing nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets, and the counterparty is not a customer. We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

Compensation- Stock Compensation 

In May 2017, the FASB issued an ASU, Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718), “Scope of Modification Accounting,” which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. The standard provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets 

On October 24, 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The FASB issued the ASU as part of its simplification initiative aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. This guidance requires that the tax effects of all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory be recognized in the period in which the transaction occurs. We were subject to this standard effective in the first quarter of 2018. The guidance is applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Leases.” The new standard amends the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases and amends disclosure requirements associated with leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We have elected to use the transition method approved by the FASB on July 30, 2018, which allows companies to apply the provisions of the new leasing standard as of January 1, 2019, without adjusting the comparative periods presented by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. 

In 2016, we established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from across all of its business segments. Management utilized a bottom-up approach to analyze the impact of the standard on our leasing portfolio by reviewing the current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard. We have developed our accounting policy, including the practical expedients provided for in ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements,” and are in the process of implementing appropriate changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support the recognition and disclosure under the new standard. Nielsen is implementing an enterprise-wide lease management system to support the ongoing accounting requirements, has finalized our process of accumulating all of the necessary information required for our lease portfolio under the new standard and is in the final stage of inputting the information into the lease management system. The Company’s ability to calculate its right of use asset and related liability is dependent on finalizing this process, which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2019. 

While we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company expects that the adoption of the ASU will increase assets and liabilities with an estimated immaterial effect to Nielsen’s retained earnings and cash flows.

Income taxes 

In February 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Comprehensive Income”. The new standard will give companies the option to reclassify stranded tax effects caused by the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. The new standard will take effect for all companies for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.
