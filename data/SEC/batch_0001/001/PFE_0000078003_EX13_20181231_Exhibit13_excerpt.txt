Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:

•A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.

•A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. For example, restrictions imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product.

•A projection or forecast that indicates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.

Identifiable Intangible Assets

As a result of our identifiable intangible asset impairment review work, we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions—Net.

When we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological risk associated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, in general, intangible assets other than goodwill that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2018) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, as R&D is an inherently risky activity. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.

Goodwill

As a result of our goodwill impairment review work, we concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2018, and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.

We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.

When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but we may also use the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.

•The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

•The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. Within the market approach are two methods that we may use:

◦Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.

◦Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.

The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued; however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the selection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.

For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” section of this Financial Review and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2018 Form 10-K.

Benefit Plans

The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. 

The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the net employee benefit obligations for the defined benefit and postretirement plans include the discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); expected return on plan assets; and healthcare cost trend rates.

Effective January 1, 2018, accruals for future benefits under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan (our largest U.S. defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit section of the Pfizer Group Pension Scheme (our largest pension plan in the U.K.) were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service costs for the plans. The Pfizer defined contribution savings plan provides additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan and active members of the Pfizer Group Pension Scheme started accruing benefits under the defined contribution section of that plan.

As of December 31, 2018, the noncurrent portion of our pension benefit obligations, net, and our postretirement benefit obligations, net decreased, in the aggregate, by approximately $747 million compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease reflects, among other things, the $500 million voluntary contribution we made to the U.S. Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan in February 2018 and an increase in the discount rate used in the measurement of plan obligations, partially offset by the decrease in the actual returns on plan assets.

Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) For detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 11B. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans: Actuarial Assumptions.

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans. 

The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The actual return on plan assets resulted in a net loss on our plan assets of approximately $895 million during 2018.

Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations

The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements.

The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately $1.5 billion.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimate of certain tax effects of the TCJA, including (i) the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in the U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) the impact on valuation allowances and other state income tax considerations, (iii) a repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings for which we plan to elect, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through 2026 that is reported in Other taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, and (iv) deferred taxes on basis differences expected to give rise to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, we had provided deferred tax liabilities in the past on foreign earnings that were not indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reversed an estimate of the deferred taxes that are no longer expected to be needed due to the change to the territorial tax system.

The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. We were able to make a reasonable estimate of the deferred taxes on the temporary differences expected to reverse in the future and provided a provisional deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017.

In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA based on our best estimates of available information and data, and have reported and disclosed the impacts within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC. The amounts recorded may change in the future due to uncertain tax positions. With respect to the aforementioned repatriation tax liability, the first installment, due in April 2019, is reported in Income taxes payable, and the remaining liability is reported in Other taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We believe that there may be additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. Any change to our calculations resulting from such additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance would be reflected in the period of issuance. In addition, our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.

Income tax assets and liabilities also include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions.

Revenues—Overview

Total revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects operational growth of $791 million, or 2%, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $310 million, or less than 1%, in 2018, compared to 2017.

Compared to 2016, total revenues for 2017 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $200 million as a result of 2017 having one less selling day in both U.S. and international markets.

Total revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 reflect a slight operational decrease of $20 million, or less than 1%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $259 million, or less than 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016.

By total revenues, the U.S., China and Japan are our three largest national markets:

Inventory Stocking

Our policy relating to the supply of pharmaceutical inventory at domestic wholesalers, and in major international markets, is to generally maintain stocking levels under one month on average and to keep monthly levels consistent from year to year based on patterns of utilization. We historically have been able to closely monitor these customer stocking levels by purchasing information from our customers directly or by obtaining other third-party information. We believe our data sources to be directionally reliable but cannot verify their accuracy. Further, as we do not control this third-party data, we cannot be assured of continuing access. Unusual buying patterns and utilization are promptly investigated.

Revenue Deductions

Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns.These deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, our adjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues, and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.

(b) Performance-based contract rebates include contract rebates with managed care customers within the U.S., including health maintenance organizations and PBMs, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms and claims under these contracts. Outside the U.S., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.

(c) Chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.

(d) Sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the U.S., discounts and distribution fees.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total revenue deductions for 2018 increased 8% compared to 2017, primarily as a result of:

•an increase in sales allowances as a result of sales growth, primarily in international markets;

•higher chargebacks to U.S. wholesalers of certain IH and EH products, partially offset by decreases in chargebacks as a result of decreases in sales of sterile injectable products;

•an increase in Medicare rebates driven by increased sales of IH products through this channel; and

•an increase in Medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of increased sales of IH products through these programs.

For information on our accruals for Medicare rebates, Medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts, including the balance sheet classification of these accruals, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 1G.

Therefore, in 2018, total Viagra revenues were reported in EH. Total Viagra revenues in 2017 represent the aggregate of worldwide revenues from Viagra IH and Viagra EH.

Emerging markets revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 11%, in 2018 to $12.7 billion, from $11.4 billion, reflecting an operational increase of $1.5 billion, or 13%. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on emerging markets revenues. The operational increase in emerging markets was driven by our EH segment, primarily by the Legacy Established Products portfolio and the Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals portfolio, as well as Prevenar 13, Ibrance and Eliquis in our IH segment.

lower birth cohort and volumes in certain developed markets. The growth in 2018 in the U.S. was primarily due to the pediatric indication partially offset by the continued decline in revenues for the adult indication due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity (i.e., the opportunity to reach adults aged 65 years and older who have not been previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13), compared to the prior-year period.

In 2014, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 13 for routine use to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includes pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. These ACIP recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September 2014 by the CDC. As with other vaccines, the CDC regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations. During the October 2018 ACIP meeting, the CDC presented initial data and indicated formal evaluation of evidence (grading) and a potential vote on the maintenance of the 65 years and older recommendation would likely happen in 2019. A potential adverse change in the ACIP recommendation would negatively impact future Prevnar 13 revenues. We continue to generate and publish data and communicate with the ACIP on the burden of pneumococcal disease and Prevnar 13 vaccine effectiveness and safety.

•Lyrica (EH (revenues from all of Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia)/IH (revenues from all other geographies)):

•Inflectra/Remsima (EH):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational growth in 2018 was primarily due to continued uptake in certain channels in the U.S., as well as in developed markets in Europe, partially offset by pricing pressures in these markets.

Inflectra uptake in the U.S. is being driven by a number of factors, including purchases by closed systems, which value long-term savings over short-term rebating, and consistent reimbursement in Medicare. To date, reimbursement coverage has been mixed. While we achieved 100% Medicare coverage, in the face of exclusionary conduct by J&J, we have experienced access challenges among commercial payers where our lower priced product has not received access at parity to the innovator product. We will continue to work with commercial payers to enable greater access for Inflectra. Additionally, in September 2017, Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against J&J alleging that J&J’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning Remicade® (infliximab) violate federal antitrust laws.

•Viagra (EH): Viagra lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017. In 2018, revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada, which were reported in IH through 2017, are reported in EH (which reported all other Viagra revenues excluding the U.S. and Canada through 2017). Therefore, in 2018, total Viagra revenues are reported in EH.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decline in the U.S. in 2018 was primarily due to the loss of exclusivity in December 2017.

The relatively flat operational performance in 2018 internationally was primarily driven by increased demand in China offset by lower volumes in Russia and developed Europe.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The international operational growth in 2018 was primarily due to increased demand in China.

•Xalkori (IH):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational decline in 2018 was primarily due to volume declines in the ALK indication across certain developed markets, primarily in the U.S. and certain markets in developed Europe, due to competitive pressure. The decline was partially offset by a continued increase in diagnostic rates for the ALK gene mutation across key markets and share in first-line ALK treatment outside the U.S., primarily in certain emerging markets, as well as uptake in treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ROS1-positive.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

The changes in expenses below reflect, among other things, the favorable impact of the February 2017 sale of HIS. The operating results of HIS are included in our operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, operating results for 2017 include approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations, while operating results for 2016 reflect 12 months of HIS global operations. Our operating results for 2018 do not reflect any HIS global operations.

Cost of Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 v. 2017 

Cost of sales increased $21 million, or were relatively flat in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to:

•increased sales volumes primary related to key products within our product portfolio; 

•higher costs across the SIP portfolio, as a result of the complexity of high quality product manufacture across the legacy Hospira plants, which was partially offset by decreases in other costs across various markets;

•an increase in royalty expenses based on the mix of products sold; and

•the unfavorable impact of hedging activity on intercompany inventory of $65 million,

partially offset by:

•lower volumes from the SIP portfolio, in developed markets, primarily due to increased competition across the SIP portfolio and continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.;

•the non-recurrence of $195 million in inventory losses, overhead costs, and incremental costs related to the period in 2017 during which our Puerto Rico plants were not operational due to hurricanes; 

•the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $153 million;

•the non-recurrence of charges related to a product recall that occurred in 2017; and

•the favorable impact of the sale of HIS of $35 million.

The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above, as well as an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales.

2017 v. 2016 

Cost of sales decreased $1.1 billion, or 9%, in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to:

•the favorable impact of the sale of HIS global operations (which carried a higher cost of sales than other products) of $561 million;

•recognition of synergies related to our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;

•the nonrecurring unfavorable impact of $248 million of acquired Hospira inventory, which is measured at fair value on the acquisition date and was amortized over the turn of the related inventory;

•the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $140 million and the favorable offset of hedging gains of $52 million; and

•a favorable change in product mix, including an operational decline in the SIP portfolio and the favorability attributed to products that have lost exclusivity,

partially offset by:

•$195 million in inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in 2017 during which our Puerto Rico plants were not operational, and incremental costs, all of which resulted from the hurricanes in Puerto Rico.

The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above, as well as an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales.

Selling, Informational and Administrative (SI&A) Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 v. 2017 

SI&A expenses decreased $350 million, or 2%, in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to:

•lower advertising, promotional and field force expenses, as well as general and administrative expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives;

•the non-recurrence of a $200 million charitable contribution to the Pfizer Foundation;

•decreased investment across several of our key products, primarily Viagra and Enbrel; and

2018 Financial Report 

  33

Financial Review

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies

•lower healthcare reform expenses as a result of a true up of the prior year amount,

partially offset by:

•additional investment across several of our key products, primarily, Xeljanz, Ibrance, Eucrisa and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13.

•additional investments in China; and

•a special, one-time bonus paid to virtually all Pfizer colleagues, excluding executives, of $119 million, in the aggregate, in the first quarter of 2018. 

2017 v. 2016 

SI&A expenses decreased $40 million, or were relatively flat in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to:

•the non-recurrence of an allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable of approximately $265 million, resulting from unfavorable developments with a distributor that was recorded in the first quarter of 2016; 

•lower advertising, promotional and field force expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives;

•lower spending for certain products, primarily Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13;

•the favorable impact of the sale of HIS global operations of $135 million; and

•lower spending for Viagra due to the loss of exclusivity in December 2017,

offset by:

•additional investment across several of our key products, primarily Eucrisa, Ibrance and Xeljanz, as well as biosimilars, primarily related to the U.S. launch of Inflectra; and

•an increase in charitable contributions, including a $200 million charitable contribution to the Pfizer Foundation, an organization that provides grant and investment funding to support organizations and social entrepreneurs in an effort to improve healthcare delivery.

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 v. 2017

R&D expenses increased $322 million, or 4%, in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to:

•increased costs associated with our Phase 3 clinical trials related to our JAK1 inhibitor (which was initiated in December 2017) and the C. difficile vaccine program (which was initiated in March 2017) as well as increased spending for our 20 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate;

•increased costs associated with the Bavencio program; and

•an increase in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, as well as management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved,

partially offset by:

•decreased spending for biosimilars as several programs have reached completion; and 

•the impact of our decision to end internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts.

2017 v. 2016

R&D expenses decreased $208 million, or 3%, in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to: 

•lower expenses of approximately $743 million due to the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the non-recurrence of its associated close-out costs;

partially offset by:

•increased costs associated with our oncology programs, primarily clinical trial spend on Medivation assets;

•lower development funding credits of approximately $124 million primarily related to the discontinuation of the global clinical development program for bococizumab in the fourth quarter of 2016;

•increased costs associated with our C. difficile vaccine program, which initiated a Phase 3 clinical study in March 2017;

•an expense of $75 million resulting from our May 2017 agreement with Sangamo to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for Hemophilia A; and

•increased costs associated with late stage development programs, including Xtandi, talazoparib and tanezumab.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amortization of intangible assets increased $135 million, or 3% in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to amortization expense of approximately $151 million (pre-tax) in 2018 associated with the approval of Xtandi in the U.S. for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The U.S. approval resulted in the transfer of $2.7 billion from an indefinite-lived IPR&D intangible asset to a finite-lived Developed technology rights intangible asset.

Amortization of intangible assets increased $703 million, or 17%, in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to amortization expense of approximately $797 million (pre-tax) in 2017 associated with the identifiable intangible assets acquired from Medivation and Anacor, partially offset by assets that became fully amortized at the end of their estimated useful lives and the favorable impact of the February 2017 sale of HIS.

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Restructuring charges––acquisition-related costs include employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs associated with business combinations. Charges for 2018 were primarily due to asset write downs, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs related to our acquisition of Hospira. Restructuring charges for 2017 were primarily due to asset write-downs, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs. For 2017 and 2016, restructuring charges––acquisition-related costs were mainly related to our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation.

(b) Restructuring (credits)/charges––cost reduction initiatives relate to employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs not associated with acquisitions. For 2018, the charges were primarily related to employee termination costs and asset write downs. The employee termination costs are associated with our improvements to operational effectiveness as part of the realignment of our organizational structure effective at the beginning of 2019. For 2017, the credits are mostly related to the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs, partially offset by asset write downs.

(c) For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.

In connection with our acquisition of Hospira in September 2015, we focused our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We achieved our expected $1 billion of annual cost savings in connection with the Hospira acquisition, 25% more than our initial cost savings target of $800 million. The one-time costs to generate the savings were approximately $1 billion (not including costs of $215 million for full-year 2015 associated with the return of acquired IPR&D rights), and the majority of these costs were incurred within the three-year period post-acquisition.

In 2016, we substantially completed previously disclosed cost-reduction initiatives begun in 2014 associated with our 2014 global commercial structure reorganization, manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization initiatives, and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives across the enterprise. Through December 31, 2016, we incurred $3.1 billion (pre-tax) in total costs for the 2014-2016 program. The cumulative ongoing annual cost savings associated with the 2014-2016 program (but not including expected cost savings associated with the 

2018 Financial Report 

  35

Hospira acquisition), are approximately $3.1 billion. These savings were recognized, for the most part, through the end of 2016. However, savings from costs incurred in the last half of 2016 largely occurred in 2017.

2017-2019 Initiatives and Organizing for Growth

During 2018, as we reviewed our business opportunities and challenges and the way in which we think about our business operations, we determined that at the start of our 2019 fiscal year, we would begin operating under our new commercial structure, which reorganizes our operations into three businesses––Biopharma, a science-based Innovative medicines business; Upjohn, a global off-patent branded and generic established medicines business; and a Consumer Healthcare business. To operate effectively in this structure and position ourselves for future growth, we are focused on creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within each business as well as the functions that support them. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we reviewed previously planned initiatives and new initiatives to ensure that there was alignment around our new structure and have combined the 2017 to 2019 initiatives with our current Organizing for Growth initiatives to form one cohesive plan. For the combined programs, to achieve targeted savings of approximately $1.9 billion, we expect to incur approximately $2.2 billion in costs over the three-year period 2017-2019. Of this amount, we expect approximately 40% to be related to manufacturing operations, and we expect approximately 20% of the charges to be non-cash. Anticipated savings through 2020 associated with the Organizing for Growth initiatives of approximately $500 million will be reinvested in our R&D pipeline and in selling and marketing to support our current and recently launched products and indications. For additional information about these programs and expected and actual total costs, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives.

In addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

PROVISION/(BENEFIT) FOR TAXES ON INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.

2018 v. 2017

The higher effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of:

•the non-recurrence of a $10.7 billion tax benefit recorded in 2017 to reflect the enactment of the TCJA,

partially offset by:

•tax benefits related to the TCJA, including certain current year tax initiatives as well as favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate of the impact of the legislation, reported and disclosed within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC;

•the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business; as well as

•an increase in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. 

2017 v. 2016

The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of:

•the tax benefits associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities, which includes the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries associated with the enactment of the TCJA; and

•a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business,

partially offset by:

•the decrease in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations; and

•the non-recurrence of tax benefits related to the final resolution of an agreement in principle reached in February 2016 and finalized in April 2016 to resolve certain claims related to Protonix, which resulted in the receipt of information that raised our initial assessment in 2015 of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position.

For details about discrete elements that impacted our tax provisions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations.

Changes in Tax Laws

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantly changes the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC we recorded provisional estimates of the legislation in the fourth-quarter 2017. In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA based on our best estimates of available information and data, and have reported and disclosed the impacts within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations and the “Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources––Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations” section of this Financial Review.

On January 23, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act No. 3-2017, amending Section 2101 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, which imposes an excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (Act 154). The excise tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from their Puerto Rico affiliates. As originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effect from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016. Act No. 2-2013 extended the excise tax through 2017 and, effective July 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. Act No. 3-2017 further extended the excise tax for all years through 2027 at a rate of 4%. The excise tax has been recorded in Cost of sales and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, as appropriate. All expected impacts in 2019 have been reflected in our financial guidance for 2019.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (ADJUSTED INCOME)

General Description of Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income)

Adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management. We measure the performance of the overall Company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare (OTC) products––prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined Adjusted income as Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. Similarly, we have defined the Adjusted income components as Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and Other (income)/deductions––net each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. We have defined Adjusted diluted earnings per share as Earnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc.––diluted before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. The Adjusted income measure, the Adjusted income component measures and the Adjusted diluted earnings per share measure are not, and should not be viewed as,substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income, U.S. GAAP net income components or U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. 

The following are examples of how the Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are utilized:

•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis;

•our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis; and

•senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures. The bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the Executive Leadership Team members and other members of senior management, are funded from a pool based on the performance measured by three financial metrics, including Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from Adjusted income. This metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding. In addition, Adjusted operating income, which is derived from Adjusted income, is one of the measures utilized to determine payout for performance share awards.

Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, Adjusted income and its components (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components) and Adjusted diluted earnings per share (unlike U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, the Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis

and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of Pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.

See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information for 2018, 2017 and 2016 below.

Purchase Accounting Adjustments

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts, primarily associated with Wyeth (acquired in 2009), Hospira (acquired in 2015), Anacor (acquired in June 2016) and Medivation (acquired in September 2016), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets (primarily manufacturing facilities), amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.

Certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been expensed.

However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income. This component of Adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. We have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. In addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.

Acquisition-Related Costs

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. For additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.

We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.

The integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. For example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the FDA and/or other global regulatory authorities.

Discontinued Operations

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.

Certain Significant Items

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their nature. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs stand on their own as they are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, but we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to loss of exclusivity or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain 

38

Financial Review

significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation, such as the TCJA discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A. Contingencies and Certain Commitments: Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1, “Legal Proceedings” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Normal, ongoing defense costs of the Company or settlements of and accruals for legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

Beginning In 2019, we will exclude the gains and losses from equity securities from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe that including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. For example, we contributed assets related to our allogeneic CAR T therapy to Allogene and received equity securities. We will restate our Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS for prior periods for consistency with our 2019 presentation.

Details of Income Statement Items Included in GAAP Reported but Excluded from Non-GAAP Adjusted Income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Included primarily in Amortization of intangible assets. 

(b) Included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. Income taxes includes the tax effect of the associated pre-tax amounts, calculated by determining the jurisdictional location of the pre-tax amounts and applying that jurisdiction’s applicable tax rate. Income taxes recorded in 2017 do not reflect any changes associated with the enactment of the TCJA. These changes resulting from the TCJA have been reflected in the line item, Certain significant items “Income taxes”.

(c) Included in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs associated with business combinations. Restructuring charges in 2018 were primarily due to asset write downs, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs related to our acquisition of Hospira. Restructuring charges for 2017 were primarily due to asset write-downs, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs. For 2017 and 2016, restructuring charges––acquisition-related costs were mainly related to our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation. Transaction costs represent external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services. Integration costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives.

(d) Amounts for the 2017 and 2016 represent the net periodic benefit costs/(credits), excluding service costs, reclassified to Other (income)/deductions––net as a result of the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2018. The credits for full-year 2017 included a net settlement gain, partially offset by accelerated amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs upon the settlement of the remaining obligation associated with the Hospira U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan.

(e) Primarily included in Cost of sales. Represents the impact of changes in estimated useful lives of assets involved in restructuring actions related to acquisitions.

(f) Included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. Income taxes includes the tax effect of the associated pre-tax amounts, calculated by determining the jurisdictional location of the pre-tax amounts and applying that jurisdiction’s applicable tax rate. Income taxes recorded in 2017 do not reflect any changes

associated with the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA. These changes resulting from the TCJA have been reflected in Certain significant items “Income taxes”. 2016 also includes an unfavorable impact of the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities resulting from our plant network restructuring activities.

(g) Included in Discontinued operations––net of tax. For all years presented, represents post-close adjustments.

(h) Amounts relate to employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs not associated with acquisitions, which are included in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives). For 2018, the charges were primarily related to employee termination costs and asset write downs. The employee termination costs are associated with our improvements to operational effectiveness as part of the realignment of our organizational structure effective at the beginning of 2019. For 2017, the credits were mostly related to the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs, partially offset by asset write downs.

*Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.

(a)  Amounts represent the revenues and costs managed by each of our operating segments. The expenses generally include only those costs directly attributable to the operating segment.

The following organizational change impacted our operating segments in 2018:

Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain costs for Pfizer’s StratCO group, which were previously reported in the operating results of our operating segments and Corporate, are reported in Other Unallocated. StratCO costs primarily include headcount costs, vendor costs and data costs largely in support of Pfizer’s commercial operations. The majority of the StratCO costs reflect additional amounts that our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented. The reporting change was made to streamline accountability and speed decision making. In 2017, we reclassified approximately $468 million of costs from IH, approximately $176 million of costs from EH and approximately $70 million of costs from Corporate to Other unallocated costs to conform to the current period presentation, and in 2016, we reclassified approximately $312 million of costs from IH, approximately $167 million of costs from EH and approximately $43 million of costs from Corporate to Other unallocated costs to conform to the current period presentation.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(i) WRD—the R&D expenses managed by our WRD organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our IH business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the IH segment via the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRD organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, including EH R&D projects. WRD is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.

(ii) GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for the operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRD portfolio as well as late-stage assets in the Innovative portfolio. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects.

(iii) Corporate—the costs associated with Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance, and worldwide procurement), the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, and partnerships with global public health and medical associations, as well as certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain costs for StratCO, which were previously reported in the operating results of our operating segments and Corporate, are reported in Other Unallocated. For additional information, see note (iv) below. 

We recognized a net $13 million loss in 2018 in Cost of sales primarily related to euro-denominated losses, partially offset by Japanese yen denominated gains on forward-exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of a portion of our foreign exchange-denominated intercompany forecasted inventory sales. We recognized a $52 million gain in 2017 as an offset to Cost of sales related to foreign currency forward-exchange contracts designated as cash flow

For information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of our segment operating results to segment operating results including estimated Other costs generally associated with each segment for 2018. While we do not manage our segments or have performance goals under such an allocated manner, we believe that some investors may find this information useful in their analyses. 

The estimated Other costs generally associated with our operating segments do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the period presented. 

For information purposes only, for 2018, we estimate that Other costs, as described above, for combined WRD and GPD costs of $3.0 billion, and combined Corporate and Other Unallocated costs of $5.8 billion after excluding (i) net interest-related expense not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately $1.0 billion in Other (income)/deductions––net); and (ii) net income from investments and other assets not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately $72 million in Other (income)/deductions––net), are generally associated with our operating segments, as follows:

(ii) Represents costs not assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs. For a description of these other costs and business activities, see note (b) above.

•WRD/GPD––The information provided for WRD and GPD was substantially all derived from our estimates of the costs incurred in connection with the R&D projects associated with each operating segment.

•Corporate/Other Unallocated––The information provided for Corporate and Other Unallocated was derived mainly using proportional allocation methods based on global, regional or country revenues or global, regional or country headcount, as well as certain cost metrics, as appropriate, such as those derived from R&D and manufacturing costs, and, to a lesser extent, specific identification and estimates. Management believes that the allocations of Corporate and Other Unallocated costs are reasonable.

The estimated Other costs generally associated with our operating segments do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the period presented.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total EH revenues from emerging markets increased $745 million, or 11%, to $7.8 billion in 2018 from $7.0 billion in 2017, primarily driven by 11% operational growth from the LEP portfolio and 13% operational growth from the SIP portfolio, partially offset by a 2% operational decline from the Peri-LOE Products portfolio. Foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on total EH revenues from emerging markets.

The changes in EH expenses below reflect, among other things, the favorable impact of the February 2017 sale of HIS. The operating results of HIS are included in EH’s operating results through February 2, 2017 and, therefore, operating results for EH for 2017 include approximately one month of HIS domestic operations and approximately two months of HIS international operations. Operating results for EH for 2018 do not reflect any contribution from HIS global operations.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Indicates calculation not meaningful or result is equal to or greater than 100%.

In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the line item, Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, is presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these changes do not reflect actual cash inflows or outflows, and excluding any other significant non-cash movements. Accordingly, the amounts shown will not necessarily agree with the changes in the assets and liabilities that are presented in our consolidated balance sheets.

Operating Activities

2018 v. 2017

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 billion in 2018, compared to $16.8 billion in 2017. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects a decrease in net cash generated from net income. The net cash generated reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business. 

In 2018, the change in the line item Other adjustments, net primarily reflects, among other items:

•non-recurrence of a non-cash net loss on early retirement of debt under an exchange offer in 2017;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

partially offset by:

•decreases in net realized gains on sales of investments in debt and equity securities;

•net losses on foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales (that fixes the cost of inventory later sold to customers); and

•a decrease in gains on the sale of property, plant and equipment.

In 2018 and 2017, the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in trade accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other current and noncurrent liabilities.

2017 v. 2016

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $16.8 billion in 2017, compared to $16.2 billion in 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an increase in benefit plan contributions. In 2017, the change in the line item Other adjustments, net primarily reflects, among other items:

•a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense;

•an increase in dividends from our investment in ViiV reclassified from operating to investing activities; 

•an increase in gains from sales of available-for-sale securities; and

•an increase in gains on the sale of property, plant and equipment,

partially offset by:

•a non-cash net loss on early retirement of debt under an exchange offer.

In 2017 and 2016, the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in trade accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other current and noncurrent liabilities. For 2016, this line item also includes the adjustments necessary to reflect the payments of certain legal claims accrued in prior periods, including for Protonix-related matters.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. We continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. We target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows. Due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:

•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our R&D activities;

•investments in our business;

•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;

•share repurchases;

•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;

•paying down outstanding debt;

•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and

•business-development activities.

Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. See the “Credit Ratings” section below. As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.

Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7. Financial Instruments for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.

(b) The increase in selected net financial liabilities was primarily driven by the decrease in long-term investments used for cash needs, partially offset by the repayment of debt. We retain a strong financial liquidity position as a result of our net cash provided by operating activities, our high-quality financial asset portfolio and access to capital markets. For additional information, see the “Credit Ratings” section of this Financial Review.

(c) The increase in working capital was primarily due to:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•a decrease in short-term borrowings as a result of repayments of commercial paper;

•an increase in inventory related to increases for certain products to meet targeted levels in the normal course of business, primarily for inventory build for supply recovery, new product launches and the movement of products within our manufacturing network; and

•the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business,

partially offset by:

•a decrease in Short-term investments mainly driven by the financing requirements for share repurchase activities, dividend payments, capital expenditures and debt repayment, partially offset by operating cash flow generation, cash from employee stock option exercises and reclassification of long-term to short-term investments; 

•an increase in income taxes payable primarily related to the reclassification of the first federal installment of the repatriation tax previously recorded in noncurrent liabilities and the timing of accruals in certain major markets in the ordinary course of business; and

•the net impact of foreign currency exchange.

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies

In September 2018, we completed a public offering of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt).

In December 2017, we exchanged approximately £833 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2038 with an interest rate of 6.50% for £1.376 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2043 with an interest rate of 2.735% (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt).

In March 2017, we completed a public offering of $1.065 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2047 with an interest rate of 4.20%, and on March 6, 2017, we completed a public offering of €4.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 0.23% (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt).

In November 2016, we completed a public offering of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.10%.

Domestic and International Selected Financial Assets

Many of our operations are conducted outside the U.S., and significant portions of our selected financial assets are held internationally. The amount of funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). The changes in tax law under the TCJA, which includes transitioning U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, will also allow us to more easily access our selected financial assets globally. As a result of the enactment of the TCJA, in 2018 we repatriated the majority of our cash we held internationally as of year-end 2017.

Credit Ratings

Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Debt Capacity––Lines of Credit

We have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, we had access to a $7.0 billion U.S. revolving credit facility expiring in 2023, which may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facility, our lenders have provided us an additional $553 million lines of credit, of which $502 million expire within one year. Of these total lines of credit, $7.5 billion were unused as of December 31, 2018. 

LIBOR

From time to time, we issue variable rate debt based on LIBOR, or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on LIBOR. Banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. We are monitoring their efforts, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided.

Global Economic Conditions––General

The global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions.

Global Economic Conditions––Venezuela Operations

Our Venezuela operations continue to operate with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. 

We used the Venezuelan bolivar soberano rate of 85.87 as our best estimate to revalue our Venezuelan bolivar denominated net monetary assets. The current DICOM rate is about 3,298.64. Future actions by the Venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in Venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically. We have in Venezuela a few net monetary assets and $39 million of non-monetary assets, and $11 million of deferred foreign exchange losses reported in the balance sheet in Accumulated other comprehensive loss––Foreign currency translation adjustments at November 30, 2018, our international quarter-end.

Our Argentina operations function in a hyperinflationary economy. The impact to Pfizer is not considered material.

Contractual Obligations 

Payments due under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, mature as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Long-term debt consists of senior unsecured notes (including fixed and floating rate, foreign currency denominated, and other notes), carried at historical proceeds, as adjusted, and capital lease obligations (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Financial Instruments). Commitments under capital leases are not significant.

(b) Our calculations of expected interest payments incorporate only current period assumptions for interest rates, foreign currency translation rates and hedging strategies (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Financial Instruments), and assume that interest is accrued through the maturity date or expiration of the related instrument.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d) Includes future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. These amounts include an agreement we entered in April 2018 to lease space in an office building in New York City. We will relocate our global headquarters to this property with occupancy expected beginning in 2022. Our future minimum rental commitment under this 20-year lease is approximately $1.7 billion. In July 2018, we completed the sale of our current headquarters buildings. We also agreed to lease these properties from the buyer while we complete our relocation.

(e) Includes agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes amounts relating to advertising, information technology services, employee benefit administration services, and potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur. Also includes obligations to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next 8 years in connection with the U.S. and EU approvals for Besponsa ($422 million) and an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next 9 years for Bosulif ($240 million), both associated with R&D arrangements. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7E. Financial Instruments: Other Noncurrent Liabilities. Also includes consideration of $175 million paid in January 2019 related to our purchase of AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infective business. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2A. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Privately Held Investment: Acquisitions.

(f) Represents estimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax for which we plan to elect, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through 2026 (with the first installment due in April 2019). Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations and Note 5C. Tax Matters: Deferred Taxes.

(g) Includes only income tax amounts currently payable. We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our noncurrent obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issues and the resolution of those issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.

The above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.

In 2019, we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion on property, plant and equipment. We rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment needs. Due to our significant operating cash flows, we believe we have the ability to meet our capital investment needs and anticipate no delays to planned capital expenditures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnification obligations generally are subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our indemnification obligations was not significant.

Certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.

Share-Purchase Plans and Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements

Our December 2015 $11 billion share repurchase program was exhausted in the third quarter of 2018. 

In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $10 billion share repurchase program, and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the third quarter of 2018 (the 2017 program).

On March 12, 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Citibank to repurchase $4.0 billion of our common stock.

In December 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a new $10.0 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. This new program is in addition to the $4.2 billion remaining under the company’s 2017 program authorization as of December, 31 2018. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 12. Equity.

In 2019, Pfizer anticipates approximately $9 billion of share repurchases, which have been completed through February 28, 2019.

On February 7, 2019, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with GS&Co. to repurchase approximately $6.8 billion of our common stock. This agreement was entered into pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 19. Subsequent Event.

Dividends on Common Stock

We paid dividends on our common stock of $8.0 billion in 2018, $7.7 billion in 2017 and $7.3 billion in 2016. In December 2018, our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $0.36 per share, payable on March 1, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2019. The first-quarter 2019 cash dividend will be our 321st consecutive quarterly dividend.

Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our businesses and to seek to increase shareholder value. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s Board of Directors and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2018.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Adopted as of December 31, 2018

Standard/Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for leases. The new ASU provides guidance for both lessee and lessor accounting models. Among other things, the new guidance requires that a right of use asset and a lease liability be recognized for leases with a duration of greater than one year. Since its issuance, the FASB has issued several ASUs, including amending the guidance to offer an additional transition method.

 January 1, 2019. We have substantially completed our review of the impact of this new guidance. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method, and therefore no adjustments will be made to amounts in our prior period financial statements. We expect to recognize approximately $1.5 billion of additional assets and corresponding liabilities on our balance sheet as of the beginning of fiscal 2019 and will record any cumulative effect of adopting the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of Retained Earnings. We do not expect that this adjustment to Retained Earnings at adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have also assessed the potential impact of embedded leases on our consolidated financial statements, given our manufacturing outsourcing, service arrangements and other agreements. In connection with this guidance we have designed new global processes, technological solutions and related controls to provide the appropriate financial accounting and disclosure data. We continue to monitor changes, modifications, clarifications or interpretations undertaken by the FASB, which may impact our conclusions.

In March 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. The new guidance requires the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. January 1, 2019. We do not have any investments with features subject to this standard and do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2017, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, and accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features (a feature in a financial instrument that reduces the strike price of an issued financial instrument if the issuer sells shares of its stock for an amount less than the currently stated strike price of the issued financial instrument or issues an equity-linked financial instrument with a strike price below the currently stated strike price of the issued financial instrument). January 1, 2019. We do not have any financial instruments with features subject to this standard and do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. Under the guidance, the measurement of equity-classified nonemployee awards will be fixed at the grant date. January 1, 2019. 

We do not have any share-based awards issued to nonemployees and do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for credit losses of financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the probable initial recognition threshold for incurred loss estimates in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. Earlier application is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. 

We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. This standard includes our financial instruments, such as accounts receivable, and investments that are generally of high credit quality.

Previously, when credit losses were measured under GAAP, an entity generally only considered past events and current conditions in measuring the incurred loss.

The new guidance requires us to identify, analyze, document and support new methodologies for quantifying expected credit loss estimates for our financial instruments, using information such as historical experience and current economic conditions, plus the use of reasonable supportable forecast information.

Standard/Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance for goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, although it cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  January 1, 2020. Earlier application is permitted. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to customers’ accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract. The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in such arrangements with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The new guidance can be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively. January 1, 2020. Earlier application is permitted. We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2018, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the interaction between the accounting guidance for collaboration agreements and revenue from contracts with customers. January 1, 2020. Earlier application is permitted We have assessed the impact of the provisions of this new guidance and do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements, and are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects.

Certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed here and under the heading entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.

The operating segment information provided in this report does not purport to represent the revenues, costs and income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income that each of our operating segments would have recorded had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.

This report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. These studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. In addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.

Financial Risk Management 

The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings. We manage these financial exposures through operational means and through the use of third-party instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We operate globally and, as such, we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, as well as in our financial assets (investments) and liabilities (borrowings). Our net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to currency risk.

On the commercial side, a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. See the “Our Operating Environment—The Global Economic Environment” section of this Financial Review for the key currencies in which we operate. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Where foreign exchange risk cannot be mitigated via operational means, we may use foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk. 

With respect to our financial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises predominantly from short-term and long-term intercompany receivables and payables, and, to a lesser extent, from short-term and long-term investments and debt, where the assets and/or liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business entity.

We also hedge some forecasted intercompany sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar to protect against longer-term movements.

In addition, under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities. In these cases, we may use foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.

For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Fair Value Measurements. 

The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any effect on another currency’s rates relative to the U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2018, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant. 

Interest Rate Risk

We are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and on our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on Pfizer’s immediate and intermediate liquidity needs.

With respect to our investments, we strive to maintain a predominantly floating-rate basis position, but our strategy may change based on prevailing market conditions. Our floating-rate assets are subject to the risk that short-term interest rates may fall and, as a result, the investments would generate less interest income. Fixed-rate investments provide a known amount of interest income regardless of a change in interest rates. We sometimes use interest rate swaps in our financial investment portfolio.

We borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. From time to time, depending on market conditions, we will change the profile of our outstanding debt by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. 

For details about these and other financial instruments, including fair valuation methodologies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7A. Financial Instruments: Fair Value Measurements. 

The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2018, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.

Equity Price Risk

We hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. From time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.

Our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.

Contingencies

Legal Matters

We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17. Contingencies and Certain Commitments).

Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges. 

We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. 

We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.

Tax Matters

We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business for tax matters (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5D. Tax Matters: Tax Contingencies).

We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If our initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to “more likely than not”; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. We regularly re-evaluate our tax positions based on the results of audits of federal, state and local and foreign income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations, changes in tax law or receipt of new information that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the “more-likely-than-not” standard.

Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Report

We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in our 2018 Financial Report. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates. We also accept responsibility for the preparation of other financial information that is included in this document.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

The Company’s independent auditors have issued their auditors’ report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears in our 2018 Financial Report under the heading, Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Audit Committee Report

The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.

The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer’s results and the assessment of Pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer’s financial statements, as well as, when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management represented to the Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.

In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Pfizer and its management. As part of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence from Pfizer.

We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm’s provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor’s independence. The Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.

As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.

The Committee discussed with Pfizer’s Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of Pfizer’s internal controls, and the overall quality of Pfizer’s financial reporting and compliance programs.

In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of Pfizer’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
