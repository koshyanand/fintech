Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in PPG’s stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are provided in Note 10, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Foreign Currency Risk

We conduct operations in many countries around the world. Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. Foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2018 and 2017 were generally designated as a hedge of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $36 million and a net liability of $19 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPG’s Income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 would have been $291 million and $255 million, respectively.

In February 2018, PPG entered into U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $575 million outstanding, which had a fair value of a net asset of $35 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, PPG had U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding, which had a fair value of a net asset of $2 million. A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $57 million and $58 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $299 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. In the first quarter of 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $8 million as of December 31, 2018. An increase in variable interest rates of 10% would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest expense by $10 million over the term of the instrument. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have an insignificant effect on PPG’s variable rate debt obligations and interest

expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Company’s fixed rate debt by approximately $84 million and $61 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPG’s annual Income before income taxes or cash flows.

Equity Price Risk

In prior years, PPG entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock to the Trust (see Note 10, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements” and Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K). In June 2016, PPG satisfied its funding obligation to the Trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled. At settlement, the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million.
