ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates.

Credit Risk. We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and net receivable position with customers, which includes amounts related to billed and unbilled accounts receivable and contract assets net of advanced billings with the same customer. Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest cash and cash equivalents in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market investments and money market mutual funds. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these cash and cash equivalents are subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. 

In addition, we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral; and therefore, are subject to potential credit risk related to our customers’ inability to pay for services provided. For example, in January 2019 one of our customers, PG&E, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Concentration of Credit Risk for additional information regarding our pre-petition receivables and this bankruptcy matter. Furthermore, the risk of nonpayment may be heightened as a result of depressed economic and financial market conditions. We believe the concentration of credit risk related to billed and unbilled receivables and contract assets is limited because of the diversity of our customers, and we perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and in some cases obtain collateral or other security from our customers.

Interest Rate Risk. As of December 31, 2018, we had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As such, we were exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long-term obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of our variable rate debt of $1.07 billion approximated book value. Our weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 3.6%. The annual effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would be approximately $5.4 million based on our December 31, 2018 balance of variable rate debt.

Foreign Currency Risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of our operations, which are primarily located within the United States. The functional currency for our foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada, Australia and Latin America, is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Accordingly, our financial performance is subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. During 2018, revenues from our foreign operations accounted for 23.2% of our consolidated revenues. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2018 caused a decrease of approximately $18 million in foreign revenues

compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2017 caused an increase of approximately $53 million in foreign revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

We are also subject to foreign currency risk with respect to sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of our operating units. To minimize the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our foreign currency risk on a cash flow basis. There were no outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2018.

We also have foreign exchange risk related to cash and cash equivalents in foreign banks. Based on the balance of cash and cash equivalents in foreign banks of $16.2 million as of December 31, 2018, an assumed 5% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in a fair value decline of $0.7 million. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
