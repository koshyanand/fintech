ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SCANA and SCE&G meet the conditions to file under the reduced disclosure format, and therefore have omitted certain information related to themselves and their consolidated affiliates and subsidiaries called for by Item 7 of Form 10-K. As a result, this Item 7 provides a management's narrative analysis of the Company's and Consolidated SCE&G's results of operations, and it should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Consolidated SCE&G makes no representation as to information relating solely to SCANA and its subsidiaries (other than Consolidated SCE&G).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs 2017

The Company's loss per share and Consolidated SCE&G's net loss reflect impairment losses taken in each period related to the abandoned Nuclear Project. Results in 2018 also reflect an electric rate reduction made effective as of the second quarter of 2018 and significant legal and other costs incurred in connection with the Nuclear Project. For the Company, 2018's results also reflect costs associated with the merger with Dominion Energy. These and other results are discussed below.

Electric Operations

Electric Operations for the Company and for Consolidated SCE&G is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric Operations operating loss (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Electric operations can be significantly impacted by the effects of weather. SCE&G estimates the effects on its electric business of actual temperatures in its service territory as compared to historical averages to approximate electric revenue and fuel costs attributable to the effects of abnormal weather. Results in both 2018 and 2017 reflect milder than normal weather in 

15

the first quarter, with 2017 being significantly milder than 2018, and warmer than normal weather in the second, third and fourth quarters, with 2018 being warmer than 2017 in each period.

2018 vs 2017 

 Operating revenues decreased in 2018 by $113.7 million pursuant to an SCPSC order whereby fuel cost recovery was offset with gains realized upon the settlement of certain interest rate derivative contracts, as further described in Other Income (Expense) below. Operating revenue also decreased by $300.4 million due to the enactment and implementation of Act 258, by $69.2 million due to the recognition of estimated amounts to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act and by lower residential and commercial average use of $48.6 million. The downward reserve adjustment related to fuel cost recovery had no effect on net income as it was fully offset by the recognition within other income of gains realized upon the settlement of certain derivative interest rate contracts. These revenue decreases were partially offset by the effects of weather of $100.4 million, residential and commercial growth of $22.4 million and higher fuel cost recovery of $65.6 million.

 Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power expenses increased due to higher fuel prices of $65.6 million, increased sales volumes associated with residential and commercial customer growth of $5.2 million and higher sales volumes associated with the effects of weather of $24.3 million. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial average use of $12.7 million. In 2018, purchased power expenses were lower and expenses for fuel used in electric generation were higher due to SCE&G's purchase of CEC and the termination of a related purchase power agreement.

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased due to higher legal and other costs arising from the abandonment of the Nuclear Project of approximately $25.6 million and increases in non-labor costs associated with the purchase of CEC of $8.5 million. These increases were partially offset by lower labor costs of $9.4 million, primarily due to the absence of Nuclear Project severance accruals in 2018.

•Impairment loss in each period represents probable disallowances of cost recovery associated with the abandoned Nuclear Project.

 Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to net plant additions.

 Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes associated with net plant additions.

Sales volumes (in GWh) related to the electric operations above, by class, were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs 2017

Retail and wholesale sales volumes increased primarily due to the effects of weather. 

16

Gas Distribution

Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G, and for the Company, also includes PSNC Energy. Gas Distribution operating income (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effect of abnormal weather conditions on gas distribution operating income is mitigated by the WNA at SCE&G and the CUT at PSNC Energy as further described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The WNA and CUT do not affect sales volumes.

2018 vs 2017 

 Operating revenues increased at SCE&G primarily due to higher gas cost recovery of $23.5 million, customer growth of $9.7 million and higher average use of $1.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $7.5 million due to the deferral of estimated amounts to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act. In addition to these factors, operating revenues for the Company increased due to weather at PSNC Energy of $63.6 million, customer growth of $12.3 million and an increased adjustment related to integrity management of $11.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a CUT adjustment of $34.3 million, decreased gas cost recoveries of $14.7 million and $14.8 million due to deferred revenues related to the Tax Act.

 Gas purchased for resale increased at SCE&G due to increased sales volumes due to weather of $14.5 million, higher gas prices of $9.0 million, higher average use of $4.8 million and firm customer growth of $4.7 million. In addition to these factors, gas purchased for resale at the Company reflects increased sales volumes due to weather at PSNC Energy of $32.1 million and customer growth of $4.6 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased gas costs of $14.7 million and the effect of a CUT adjustment of $3.9 million.

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to higher labor costs.

 Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to net plant additions. 

 Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes associated with net plant additions.

Sales volumes (in MMBTU) related to gas distribution by class, including transportation, were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs 2017

Residential, commercial and industrial sales volumes at the Company and Consolidated SCE&G increased due to the effects of weather and customer growth. Transportation volumes increased at the Company primarily due to a significant customer expansion and increased natural gas fired electric generation within PSNC Energy's territory. 

17

Gas Marketing

Gas Marketing is comprised of the Company’s nonregulated marketing operation, SCANA Energy, which operates in the southeast and includes Georgia’s retail natural gas market. Gas Marketing operating revenues and net income were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs 2017

Operating revenues decreased primarily due to the impact of adopting revenue recognition guidance (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), whereby certain pass through charges are no longer classified as revenues. Net income increased due to the effects of weather.

Other Operating Expenses

Other operating expenses were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Changes in other operating expenses are largely attributable to the electric operations and gas distribution segments and are addressed in those discussions. In addition, other operation and maintenance expense includes certain legal and other costs arising from the abandonment of the Nuclear Project and the merger with Dominion Energy. Increases in such costs at the Company totaled approximately $81.1 million (including $25.6 million attributable to Consolidated SCE&G). The increases attributable to Consolidated SCE&G are included in amounts described in electric operations.

Net Periodic Pension Benefit Cost

 Other operation and maintenance expense includes net periodic pension benefit cost, which was recorded on the income statements and balance sheets as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pursuant to regulatory orders, SCE&G recovers current pension expense through a rate rider (for retail electric operations) and through cost of service rates (for gas operations), and amortizes pension costs previously deferred in regulatory assets as further described in Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts amortized were $2.0 million for retail electric operations and $1.0 million for gas operations for each period presented. Pursuant to regulatory orders, PSNC Energy recovers current pension expense through cost of service rates.

18

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense), net includes the results of certain incidental non-utility activities of regulated subsidiaries, the activities of certain non-regulated subsidiaries, governance activities of SCANA and AFC. AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. An equity portion of AFC is included in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC is included in interest charges (credits), both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. Components of other income (expense), net were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs 2017 

Other income at the Company and Consolidated SCE&G increased primarily due to the recognition of $113.7 million of gains realized upon the settlement of certain interest rate derivative contracts and $6.9 million of gains from land sales. The gains related to the settlement of interest rate derivative contracts were fully offset by downward adjustments to electric revenues pursuant to a previously received SCPSC order related to fuel cost recovery and, as such, had no effect on net income. These increases were partially offset by $10.9 million due to the absence of accrual of carrying costs on unrecovered Nuclear Project costs in 2018 and by $17.5 million due to lower carrying cost accrual on certain other deferred items. Other expense at the Company and Consolidated SCE&G decreased $2.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, due to changes in non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense recognized within other expense. At the Company, the decreases also include lower expenses related to other benefit programs. Equity AFC decreased primarily due to the abandonment of the Nuclear Project in 2017.

Interest Expense

Components of interest expense, net of the debt component of AFC, were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest charges increased primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt at SCE&G and PSNC Energy in 2018, the accrual of interest related to uncertain tax positions and lower debt AFC due to the abandonment of the Nuclear Project. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt at GENCO with short-term borrowings at lower rates.

Income Tax Benefit

At the Company and Consolidated SCE&G, income tax benefit increased primarily due to higher losses before taxes as a result of the increased impairment loss recognized in 2018 and the effect of the electric rate change effective in the second quarter.
