ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company entered into foreign currency forward currency exchange contracts during 2018 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018. Foreign currency forward contracts are described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71 of our 2018 Annual Report. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The interest rate lock agreements entered into in 2016 were settled during 2017. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 61 through 62 of our 2018 Annual Report.
