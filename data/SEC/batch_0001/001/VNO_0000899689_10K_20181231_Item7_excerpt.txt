ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.4% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2018. All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

We own and operate office and retail properties with a concentration in the New York City metropolitan area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments.

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________

(1)Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;

•developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Overview - continued 

Acquisitions

537 West 26th Street

On February 9, 2018, we acquired 537 West 26th Street, a 14,000 square foot commercial property adjacent to our 260 Eleventh Avenue office property, and 55,000 square feet of additional zoning air rights for $44,000,000. 

1535 Broadway

On July 30, 2012, we entered into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) (“Host”), under which we redeveloped the retail and signage components of the Marriott Times Square Hotel. We accounted for this lease as a “capital lease” and recorded a $240,000,000 capital lease asset and liability. On September 21, 2018, we acquired the retail condominium from Host for $442,000,000 (inclusive of the $240,000,000 capital lease liability). The original lease transaction provided that we would become the 100% owner through a put/call arrangement, based on a pre-negotiated formula. This transaction satisfies the put/call arrangement. Our 100% fee interest includes 45,000 square feet of retail, the 1,611 seat Marquis Theater and the largest digital sign in New York with a 330 linear foot, 25,000 square foot display.

Farley Office and Retail Building

On October 30, 2018, we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture that is developing the Farley Office and Retail Building to 95.0% from 50.1% by acquiring a 44.9% additional ownership interest from the Related Companies ("Related"). The purchase price was $41,500,000 plus the reimbursement of $33,026,000 of costs funded by Related through October 30, 2018. We consolidate the accounts of the joint venture as of October 30, 2018. In connection therewith, we recorded a net gain of $44,060,000, which is included in "purchase price fair value adjustment" on our consolidated statements of income. As a result of this gain, because we hold our investment in the joint venture through a taxable REIT subsidiary, $16,771,000 of income tax expense was recognized on our consolidated statements of income.

Dispositions

On January 17, 2018, Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (the "Fund") completed the sale of the retail condominium at 11 East 68th Street, a property located on Madison Avenue and 68th Street, for $82,000,000. From the inception of this investment through its disposition, the Fund realized a $46,259,000 net gain. 

On June 21, 2018 we completed the $45,000,000 sale of 27 Washington Square North, which resulted in a net gain of $23,559,000 which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. 

On August 3, 2018, we completed the sale of our 49.5% interests in the 666 Fifth Avenue Office Condominium. We received net proceeds of $120,000,000 and recognized a financial statement gain of $134,032,000 which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. The gain for tax purposes was approximately $254,000,000. We continue to own all of the 666 Fifth Avenue Retail Condominium encompassing the Uniqlo, Tissot and Hollister stores with 125 linear feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street. Concurrently with the sale of our interests, the existing mortgage loan on the property was repaid and we received net proceeds of $55,244,000 for the participation we held in the mortgage loan. We recognized a financial statement gain of $7,308,000, which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. 

Financings

Preferred Securities

On January 4 and 11, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.625% Series G and Series I cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units at their redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, or $470,000,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption, and expensed $14,486,000 of previously capitalized issuance costs.

Financings - continued

Unsecured Term Loan

On October 26, 2018, we extended our $750,000,000 unsecured term loan from October 2020 to February 2024. The interest rate on the extended unsecured term loan was lowered from LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 1.00% (3.52% as of December 31, 2018). In connection with the extension of our unsecured term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap from LIBOR plus 1.00% to a fixed rate of 3.87% through October 2023.

Other Financings

On January 5, 2018, we completed a $100,000,000 refinancing of 33-00 Northern Boulevard (Center Building), a 471,000 square foot office building in Long Island City, New York. The seven-year loan is at LIBOR plus 1.80%, which was swapped to a fixed rate of 4.14%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $37,200,000 after repayment of the existing 4.43% $59,800,000 mortgage and closing costs.

On April 19, 2018, the joint venture between the Fund and the Crowne Plaza Joint Venture completed a $255,000,000 refinancing of the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 3.53% (6.00% at December 31, 2018) and matures in May 2020 with three one-year extension options. In connection therewith, the joint venture purchased an interest rate cap that caps LIBOR at a rate of 4.00%. The Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel was previously encumbered by a $310,000,000 interest-only mortgage at LIBOR plus 2.80%, which was scheduled to mature in December 2018.

On June 11, 2018, the joint venture that owns Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,327 unit residential complex in the Tribeca submarket of Manhattan completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of Independence Plaza. The seven-year interest-only loan matures in July 2025 and has a fixed rate of 4.25%. Our share of net proceeds, after repayment of the existing 3.48% $550,000,000 mortgage and closing costs, was $55,618,000. 

On August 9, 2018, we completed a $120,000,000 refinancing of 4 Union Square South, a 206,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.40% (3.75% as of December 31, 2018) and matures in 2025, as extended. The property was previously encumbered by a $113,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 2.15%, which was scheduled to mature in 2019.

On November 16, 2018, we completed a $205,000,000 refinancing of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.88% (4.26% as of December 31, 2018) and matures in 2024, as extended. Concurrently, we invested $105,000,000 in a participation in the refinanced mortgage loan, which earns interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% (4.38% as of December 31, 2018) and also matures in 2024, as extended, and is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. The property was previously encumbered by a mortgage of the same amount at LIBOR plus 2.25%, which was scheduled to mature in 2020. 

Other Activities

220 Central Park South ("220 CPS")

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of 11 condominium units at 220 CPS for net proceeds aggregating $214,776,000 and resulting in a financial statement net gain of $81,224,000 which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. In connection with these sales, $13,888,000 of income tax expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of income and $213,000,000 of the $950,000,000 220 CPS loan was repaid.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Real Estate

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Upon the acquisition of real estate we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments which are on a relative fair value basis. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, were $13.1 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $136,781,000 and $159,260,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $161,594,000 and $205,600,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated discounted cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

49

Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and whether we are the primary beneficiary, or hold a majority of the voting interests of the entity. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to decisions that most significantly impact the performance of the partially owned entity. This includes decisions regarding operating/capital budgets, and the placement of new or additional financing secured by the assets of the venture, among others. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method.

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when there is a decline in the fair value below the carrying value and we conclude such decline is other-than-temporary. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. 

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities were $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•Base rent is revenue arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

•Hotel revenue arising from the operation of Hotel Pennsylvania consists of room revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Room revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been transferred.

•Trade shows revenue arising from the operation of trade shows is primarily booth rentals. This revenue is recognized upon the occurrence of the trade shows.

•Operating expense reimbursements is revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the common areas of our properties. Revenue is generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred.

•Tenant services is revenue arising from sub-metered electric, elevator, trash removal and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

50

Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Revenue Recognition - continued

•Fee and other income includes management, leasing and other revenue arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities, and includes Building Maintenance Service (“BMS”) cleaning, engineering and security services. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred. Fee and other income also includes lease termination fee income which is recognized immediately if a tenant vacates or is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shortened remaining lease term.

Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectability. If our assessment of the collectability of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

Net Operating Income At Share by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 

NOI represents total revenues less operating expenses. We consider NOI to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI should not be considered a substitute for net income. NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is a summary of NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Same Store Net Operating Income At Share

Same store NOI at share represents NOI at share from operations which are owned by us and in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store NOI at share - cash basis is NOI at share from operations before straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments which are owned by us and in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store NOI and same store NOI - cash basis should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Related Party Transactions

Alexander’s, Inc.

We own 32.4% of Alexander’s. Steven Roth, the Chairman of Vornado’s Board of Trustee’s and its Chief Executive Officer, is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Alexander’s. We provide various services to Alexander’s in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 7 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interstate Properties (“Interstate”)

Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander’s, respectively, are Interstate’s two other general partners. As of December 31, 2018, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 7.1% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 26.2% of Alexander’s common stock.

We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days’ notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $453,000, $501,000, and $521,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Urban Edge Properties

We own 4.5% of UE. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we provided UE with information technology support. UE is providing us with leasing and property management services for (i) certain small retail properties that we plan to sell and (ii) our affiliate, Alexander's, Rego retail assets. Fees paid to UE for servicing the retail assets of Alexander’s are similar to the fees that we are receiving from Alexander’s.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loan and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity securities; and asset sales. 

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of after tax net income from the sales of 100% of the 220 CPS residential condominium units. As of December 31, 2018, 83% of the condominium units are sold or under sales contracts, with closings scheduled through 2020. 

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities or redeem our equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On January 16, 2019, Vornado declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.66 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.64 per common share). This dividend, if and when declared by the Board of Trustees for all of 2019, will require Vornado to pay out approximately $503,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2019, Vornado expects to pay approximately $50,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $33,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” We have issued senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of December 31, 2018, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2018, we had $570,916,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,406,663,000 of borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, net of letters of credit of $13,337,000. A summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our consolidated outstanding debt, net of deferred financing costs and other, was $9,836,621,000 at December 31, 2018, a $107,134,000 increase from the balance at December 31, 2017. During 2019 and 2020, $95,782,000 and $2,142,369,000, respectively, of our outstanding debt matures; we may refinance this maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facilities. We may also refinance or prepay other outstanding debt depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations – continued

Details of 2018 financing activities are provided in the “Overview” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2017 financing activities are discussed below.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On October 17, 2017, we extended one of our two $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities from November 2018 to January 2022 with two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the extended facility was lowered from LIBOR plus 1.05% to LIBOR plus 1.00%. The interest rate and facility fees are the same as our other $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in February 2021 with two six-month extension options.

Secured Debt

On December 27, 2017, we completed a public offering of $450,000,000 3.50% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2025. The interest rate on the senior unsecured notes will be payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15, commencing July 15, 2018. The notes were sold at 99.596% of their face amount to yield 3.565%. 

On December 27, 2017, we redeemed all of the $450,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding 2.50% senior unsecured notes which were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2019, at a redemption price of approximately 100.71% of the principal amount plus accrued interest through the date of redemption. In connection therewith, we expensed $4,836,000 of debt prepayment costs and wrote-off unamortized deferred financing costs which are included in "interest and debt expense" on our consolidated statements of income.

Preferred Securities

In December 2017, we sold 12,780,000 5.25% Series M cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement. We received aggregate net proceeds of $309,609,000, after underwriters’ discounts and issuance costs and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 12,780,000 5.25% Series M preferred units (with economic terms that mirror those of the Series M preferred shares). Dividends on the Series M preferred shares/units are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series M preferred shares/units are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our properties or securities. On or after five years from the date of issuance (or sooner under limited circumstances), we may redeem the Series M preferred shares/units at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption. The Series M preferred shares/units have no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us.

In December 2017, we called for redemption of all of the outstanding 6.625% Series G and 6.625% Series I cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units. As a result, as of December 31, 2017, we reclassed the 6.625% Series G and 6.625% Series I cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units from shareholder's equity/partner's capital to liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. In January 2018, we completed the redemption of all of the outstanding Series G and Series I cumulative redeemable preferred shares/units.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet at 220 CPS. The development cost of this project (exclusive of land cost of $515.4 million) is estimated to be approximately $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion has been expended as of December 31, 2018.

We are developing a 173,000 square foot Class A office building, located along the western edge of the High Line at 512 West 22nd Street in the West Chelsea submarket of Manhattan (55.0% interest).

We are in the planning phase to redevelop PENN2, a 1,634,000 square foot office building located on the west side of 7th Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street.

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, including, in particular, the Penn District. 

Farley Office and Retail Building and Moynihan Train Hall

Our 95.0% joint venture (the remaining 5.0% is owned by the Related Companies "Related") is developing the Farley Office and Retail Building (the "Project"), which will include approximately 850,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 120,000 square feet of retail space. The total development cost of the Project is estimated to be approximately $800,000,000 (exclusive of a $230,000,000 upfront contribution and net of anticipated historic tax credits). As of December 31, 2018, $144,491,000 has been expended. 

The joint venture has entered into a development agreement with Empire State Development (“ESD”), an entity of New York State, to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture has entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders pursuant to which they will build the Moynihan Train Hall, thereby fulfilling all of the joint venture's obligations to ESD. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. The development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall are estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, which will be funded by governmental agencies. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 840-40-55, the joint venture, which we consolidate on our consolidated balance sheets, is required to recognize all development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall. Accordingly, the development expenditures paid for by governmental agencies through December 31, 2018 of $445,693,000 are shown as “Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures” with a corresponding obligation recorded in “Moynihan Train Hall obligation” on our consolidated balance sheets. Upon completion of the development, the "Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures" and the offsetting “Moynihan Train Hall obligation” will be removed from our consolidated balance sheets. 

There can be no assurance that any of our development or redevelopment projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed, or completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance 

We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $260,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for terrorism acts with limits of $4.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate, and $2.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which expires in December 2020.  

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,453,000 and 19% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC. 

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies 

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us, except for the mortgage loan secured by 7 West 34th Street, which we guaranteed and therefore is part of our tax basis. In certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $660,000,000. 

As of December 31, 2018, $13,337,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

A joint venture in which we own a 95.0% ownership interest was designated by ESD, an entity of New York State, to develop the Farley Office and Retail Building. The joint venture entered into a development agreement with ESD and a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders. Under the development agreement with ESD, the joint venture is obligated to build the Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture’s obligations. Under the design-build agreement, Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders is obligated to fulfill all of the joint venture’s obligations. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. 

As of December 31, 2018, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $18,000,000. 

As of December 31, 2018, we have construction commitments aggregating approximately $404,000,000.

Funds From Operations

Vornado Realty Trust

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by our management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 19 – Income Per Share/Income Per Class A Unit, in our consolidated financial statements on page 150 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In accordance with the NAREIT December 2018 restated definition of FFO, we have elected to exclude the mark-to-market adjustments of marketable equity securities from the calculation of FFO. Our FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 has been adjusted to exclude the $26,602,000, or $0.13 per share, decrease in fair value of marketable equity securities previously reported. 

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $210,100,000, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $153,151,000, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the prior year's three months. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $729,740,000, or $3.82 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $717,805,000, or $3.75 per diluted share, for the prior year. Details of certain items that impact FFO are discussed in the financial results summary of our “Overview.”
