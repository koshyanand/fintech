ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We use various financial instruments, particularly swap contracts and interest rate caps, to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt. Foreign currency forwards and options are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, and forecasted royalties, forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions.

We are exclusively an end user of these instruments, which are commonly referred to as derivatives. We do not engage in trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets. More detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in Note 18—Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks.

•Our primary interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2018 was to interest rate fluctuations in the U.S., specifically LIBOR and asset-backed commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities. In addition, interest rate movements in one country, as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can impact us. We anticipate that LIBOR and asset-backed commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future.

•We are currently evaluating the impact of the transition from the LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates, including but not limited to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Currently the Company has several debt and derivative instruments in place that reference LIBOR-based rates. The transition from LIBOR is estimated to take place in 2021 and management will continue to actively assess the related opportunities and risks involved in this transition.  

•We have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide particularly with respect to the Australian and Canadian dollars, the British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and the Euro. We anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future. 

We assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% change in our effective weighted average interest rate would not generate a material change in interest expense.

Our variable rate borrowings, which include our term loan, non-recourse bank conduit facilities, revolving credit facilities and a portion of secured fixed-rate notes which have been swapped to a variable interest rate, exposes us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates. The total outstanding balance of such variable rate borrowings at December 31, 2018 was approximately $518 million in non-recourse debt and $867 million in corporate debt. A 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rates would result in approximately a $5 million increase or decrease in annual consumer financing interest expense and a $9 million increase or decrease in annual long-term debt interest expense. 

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. We use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of vacation ownership contract receivables. The primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds, estimated loss rates and discount rates. We use a duration-based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt and interest rate derivatives. The primary assumption used in these models is that a 10% increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities.

We use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of our foreign currency derivatives used by us to hedge underlying exposure that primarily consist of the non-functional current assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries. The primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all our currency exposures as of December 31, 2018. The gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities or expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, the absolute notional amount of our outstanding foreign exchange hedging instruments was $67 million. We have determined through such analyses, that a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not generate a material increase or decrease to the fair value of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the underlying exposure being economically hedged.

Our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented. While probably the most meaningful analysis, these “shock tests” are constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based

on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled.

We used December 31, 2018 market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures — interest and foreign currency rate instruments. The estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates.
