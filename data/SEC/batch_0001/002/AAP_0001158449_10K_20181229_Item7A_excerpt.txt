Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks. 

We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based, at our option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

Our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables. We are exposed to normal credit risk from customers. Our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances, which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base. We have not historically had significant credit losses.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of our inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies. We believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income.
