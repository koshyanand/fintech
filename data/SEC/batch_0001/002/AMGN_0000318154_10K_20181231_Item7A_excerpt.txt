Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.

In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments

Our portfolio of available-for-sale interest-bearing securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was composed of U.S. Treasury securities and other government-related debt securities, corporate debt securities, residential mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market mutual funds and other short-term interest-bearing securities composed principally of commercial paper. The fair values of our investment portfolio of interest-bearing securities were $28.7 billion and $41.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these securities of $360 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, on these dates. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.

As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $35.3 billion and a fair value of $38.6 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates, with variable-rate debt having carrying values of $850 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in increases of $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.

To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $10.95 billion and $9.45 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of $460 million and $420 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.6 billion that hedge certain of our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of $320 million and $390 million, respectively.

Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instruments

Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.

As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and fair value of $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.3 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.2 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.

We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with an aggregate notional amount of $5.6 billion, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing yearsâ€™ income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.

We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2018, we had open foreign currency forward and option contracts, primarily euro based with notional amounts of $4.5 billion and $21 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had open foreign currency forward and option contracts, primarily euro based with notional amounts of $4.6 billion and $74 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 the fair values of these contracts were a $181 million asset and a $26 million liability. As of December 31, 2017 the fair values of these contracts were a $6 million asset and a $204 million liability. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $810 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $380 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $360 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $737 million and $757 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.

Market-price-sensitive financial instruments

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was not material.

Counterparty credit risks

Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of Aâ€“ or equivalent by S&P, Moodyâ€™s or Fitch and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.
