 Exhibit 99  

 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  

 LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  

 In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act), Ball is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause Ball’s actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball. Forward-looking statements may be made in several different contexts; for example, in the company’s Form 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), quarterly and annual earnings news releases, quarterly earnings conference calls hosted by the company, public presentations at investor and credit conferences, the company’s Annual Report and in other periodic communications with investors. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking statements may change; however, except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised to consult any further disclosures and cautionary statements Ball makes on related subjects in our Form10-K, 10‑Q and 8‑K reports and other filings with the SEC. The Reform Act defines forward-looking statements as statements that express or imply an expectation or belief and contain a projection, plan or assumption with regard to, among other things, future revenues, income, earnings per share, cash flow or capital structure. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” “targets,” “likely,” “foresees”, “positions” and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical facts. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should therefore not place undue reliance upon such statements. Rather, these statements involve estimates, assumptions uncertainties and known and unknown risks, many of which are outside our control, and such statements are therefore qualified in their entirety by reference to the following important factors, among others (including those described in any “Risk Factors” section of our most current Form 10-K, 10-Q or other filings with the SEC), that could cause Ball’s actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball:  

   ●    Fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, spending, demand or preferences, both on a seasonal basis and those that may be longer-term or structural in nature, including any effect on demand for our products as a result of the enactment of laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our customers’ products.   

   ●    Customer, competitor or supplier consolidation and potential correspondent supply chain influence.    

   ●    Loss of one or more major customers or suppliers or changes to contracts with one or more customers or suppliers.   

   ●    Failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or cost reductions including those associated with capital expenditures; failure to achieve an appropriate or optimal level of maintenance and capital expenditures; and failure to achieve expectations with respect to expansion plans, accretion to reported earnings, working capital improvements and investment income or cash flow projections.   

   ●    Changes in climate and weather; acts of war, terrorism or other significant or catastrophic geopolitical events or natural disasters, or the catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing or operating facilities.   

   ●    Financial risks, including changes in interest rates affecting our debt or our ability to comply with the terms of our debt instruments; changes in the hedging markets or our inability or failure to economically hedge or insure against certain risks or potential exposures; changes in foreign exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which the company and its joint ventures carry on business; counterparty risk; liquidity risk; inflation or deflation; and changes in capital availability and our access to financing, including the risk of constraints on financing in the event of a credit rating downgrade.
