Fiscal 2019 Pinnacle Acquisition

On October 26, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc ("Pinnacle"), a branded packaged foods company specializing in shelf-stable and frozen foods (the "Pinnacle acquisition"). As a result of the acquisition, Pinnacle became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The total amount of consideration paid in connection with the acquisition was approximately $8.03 billion, consisting of cash and shares of our stock, as described in more detail in the section entitled "Acquisitions" below.

In connection with the Pinnacle acquisition, we incurred approximately $8.33 billion of long-term debt and received cash proceeds of $575.0 million ($555.7 million net of related fees) from the issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering. We used such proceeds for the payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration (as defined below), the repayment of Pinnacle debt acquired, the refinancing of certain Conagra Brands debt, and the payment of related fees and expenses.

The integration of Pinnacle is continuing and on-track. We expect to achieve cost synergies of $285 million per year when the integration is concluded.

Fiscal 2019 Results

Fiscal 2019 performance compared to fiscal 2018 reflected an increase in net sales, including the impact of recent acquisitions, with organic (excludes the impact of foreign exchange and divested businesses, as well as acquisitions until the anniversary date of the acquisition) increases in our Refrigerated & Frozen and International operating segments, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. Overall gross margin increased as the addition of Pinnacle's gross profit, along with supply chain realized productivity and improved pricing, more than offset higher transportation costs, inflation, and increased investments in retailer marketing. Overall segment operating profit increased primarily due to the Pinnacle acquisition. Corporate expenses were primarily flat due to items impacting comparability, as discussed below, as well as increased costs in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition. We experienced a decrease in equity method investment earnings and increases in both interest expense and income tax expense, in each case compared to fiscal 2018.

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were $1.52, including earnings of $1.53 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $0.01 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 were $1.98, including earnings of $1.95 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Several significant items affect the comparability of year-over-year results of continuing operations (see "Items Impacting Comparability" below).

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was signed into law. The Tax Act reduced tax rates and modified certain policies, credits, and deductions and has certain international tax consequences. The Tax Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The Tax Act's corporate rate reduction became effective January 1, 2018, in the middle of our third quarter of fiscal 2018. Given our off-calendar fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal statutory tax rate was a blended rate. Our federal statutory rate was 21% in fiscal 2019.

Acquisitions

On October 26, 2018, we completed the Pinnacle acquisition. As a result of the Pinnacle acquisition, Pinnacle became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 26, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Company, Pinnacle, and Patriot Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that ceased to exist at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Pinnacle common stock was converted into the right to receive $43.11 per share in cash and 0.6494 shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Shares") (together, the "Merger Consideration"), with cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Company Shares. The total amount of consideration paid in connection with the acquisition was approximately $8.03 billion and consisted of: (1) cash of $5.17 billion ($5.12 billion, net of cash acquired); (2) 77.5 million Company Shares, with an approximate value of $2.82 billion, issued out of the Company's treasury to former holders of Pinnacle stock; and (3) replacement awards issued to former Pinnacle employees representing the fair value attributable to pre-combination service of $51.1 million. Approximately $7.02 billion of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill, pending determination of the final purchase price allocation. Approximately $3.52 billion has been allocated to brands, trademarks and other intangibles. Of the total goodwill, $236.7 million is deductible for tax purposes. Amortizable brands, trademarks and other intangibles totaled $668.7 million. Indefinite lived brands, trademarks and other intangibles totaled $2.85 billion. This business is reflected in the Pinnacle Foods segment.

In February 2018, we acquired the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, maker of frozen breakfast and entree flatbread pocket sandwiches, for a cash purchase price of $87.3 million, net of cash acquired. Approximately $57.8 million has been classified as goodwill, and $9.7 million and $7.1 million have been classified as non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. The amount of goodwill allocated is deductible for tax purposes. The business is included in the Refrigerated & Frozen segment.

Approximately $73.8 million and $10.3 million of the purchase price have been allocated to non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. The business is primarily included in the Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent in the International segment.

In April 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC, maker of Duke’s® meat snacks, and BIGS LLC, maker of BIGS® seeds, for $217.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired (the "Thanasi acquisition"). Approximately $133.3 million has been classified as goodwill, of which $70.5 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Approximately $65.1 million and $16.1 million of the purchase price have been allocated to non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. These businesses are primarily included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.

In September 2016, we acquired the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC, including the Frontera®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands (the "Frontera acquisition"). These businesses make authentic, gourmet Mexican food products and contemporary American cooking sauces. We acquired the businesses for $108.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Approximately $39.5 million has been classified as goodwill and $59.5 million and $7.2 million have been classified as non-amortizing and amortizing intangible assets, respectively. The amount allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. These businesses are included primarily in the Grocery & Snacks and the Refrigerated & Frozen segments, and to a lesser extent within the International segment.

Divestitures 

On May 24, 2019, we completed the sale of our Italian-based frozen pasta business, Gelit, for proceeds net of cash divested of $77.5 million, subject to final working capital adjustments. The results of operations of the divested Gelit business are primarily included in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we also completed the sale of our Wesson® oil business for net proceeds of $171.8 million, subject to final working capital adjustments. The results of operations of the divested Wesson® oil business are primarily included in our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within the Foodservice and International segments, for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada for combined proceeds of $32.2 million. The results of operations of the divested Del Monte® business are included in our International segment for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction. 

23

On November 9, 2016, we completed the spinoff (the "Spinoff") of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston"). The results of operations of the Lamb Weston business have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec") and our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank are included in the Commercial segment.

Restructuring Plans

In December 2018, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a restructuring and integration plan related to the ongoing integration of the recently acquired operations of Pinnacle (the "Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan") for the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies between the companies, as a result of which we expect to incur material charges for exit and disposal activities under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). We expect to incur up to $360.0 million ($285.0 million of cash charges and $75.0 million of non-cash charges) in connection with operational expenditures under the Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan.

Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2019, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of cost expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. We have incurred or expect to incur approximately $260.1 million of charges ($254.0 million of cash charges and $6.1 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan. In fiscal 2019, we recognized charges of $168.2 million, which were primarily cash charges.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management initiated a new restructuring plan (the "Conagra Restructuring Plan") for costs in connection with actions taken to improve selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense effectiveness and efficiencies and to optimize our supply chain network. We have incurred or expect to incur $4.3 million of charges ($2.4 million of cash charges and $1.9 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the Conagra Restructuring Plan. We are not able to quantify the scope of the entire Conagra Restructuring Plan at this time. In fiscal 2019, we recognized charges of $2.2 million ($1.4 million of cash charges and $0.8 million in non-cash charges) in connection with the Conagra Restructuring Plan.

As of May 26, 2019, we had substantially completed our restructuring activities related to the Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan (the "SCAE Plan"). We recognized charges of $9.6 million, $38.0 million, and $63.6 million in connection with the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our total pre-tax expenses for the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations are expected to be $471.0 million ($321.0 million of cash charges and $150.0 million of non-cash charges).

SEGMENT REVIEW

We reflect our results of operations in the following reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice, Pinnacle Foods, and Commercial.

Grocery & Snacks

The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States. 

Refrigerated & Frozen

The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.

International

The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.

24

Foodservice

The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products, that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States. 

Pinnacle Foods

The Pinnacle Foods reporting segment includes branded and private-labeled food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels in the United States and Canada. Results of the Pinnacle Foods segment reflect activity beginning on October 26, 2018, the date of the Pinnacle acquisition.

Commercial 

The Commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients, which were sold primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings®. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses were sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses comprised the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately. 

The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations, under this methodology:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of May 26, 2019, the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $1.4 million. This amount reflected net gains of $1.0 million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019, as well as net gains of $0.4 million incurred prior to fiscal 2019. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $0.9 million in fiscal 2020 and $0.5 million in fiscal 2021 and thereafter.

25

Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018 

Net Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Overall, our net sales were $9.54 billion in fiscal 2019, an increase of 20% compared to fiscal 2018.

Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2019 were $3.28 billion, a decrease of $7.8 million compared to fiscal 2018. Volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was flat in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This result reflected merchandising changes and price elasticity-related declines in certain brands, as well as isolated production challenges, partially offset by the continued benefit from momentum and innovation successes in the snacks businesses. Price/mix was flat compared to the prior year as unfavorable mix, coupled with increases in brand building investments with retailers were offset by the impact of higher pricing. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which was completed in October 2017, contributed $41.3 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 results included $115.9 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $156.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. 

Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2019 were $2.80 billion, an increase of $51.0 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business, which was completed in February 2018, contributed $25.7 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. 

International net sales for fiscal 2019 were $793.4 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 2% increase in volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, a 4% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2018. The volume and price/mix increases for fiscal 2019 were driven by growth in the Canadian snacks and frozen businesses. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $3.7 million to International net sales for fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Fiscal 2019 included $4.1 million of net sales related to our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $48.9 million of net sales related to this divested business. In addition, fiscal 2019 and 2018 results included $17.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively, related to our divested Wesson® oil business.

Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2019 were $934.2 million, a decrease of $120.6 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2018. Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 14% decrease in volume, excluding divestitures. The decline in volume reflected the continued execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy and the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Price/mix increased 5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2019 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value-over-volume strategy. Fiscal 2019 included $34.2 million of net sales related to our Wesson® oil business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results included $53.4 million of net sales related to this divested business. Net sales declined by approximately 7% in fiscal 2019 due to the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility.

Pinnacle Foods net sales for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) were $1.73 billion. Results reflected expected consumption declines as the Company executes its value-over-volume strategy within the Pinnacle portfolio.

Segment Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expenses, pension and postretirement non-service income, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2019 was $689.2 million, a decrease of $35.6 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2018. Gross profits were $55.8 million lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018. The lower gross profit was driven by higher input costs, transportation inflation, and a reduction in profit associated with the divestiture of the Wesson® oil business, partially offset by profit contribution of acquisitions and supply chain realized productivity. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $12.6 million to Grocery & Snacks gross profit in fiscal 2019, through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2019 decreased by $31.3 million compared to fiscal 2018. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by charges totaling $76.5 million in fiscal 2019 for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® and Red Fork® brand assets and $4.0 million in fiscal 2018 for the impairment of our HK Anderson®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brand assets. Grocery & Snacks also recognized a $33.1 million gain on the sale of our Wesson® oil business in fiscal 2019. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment included $1.0 million and $11.4 million of expenses in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to acquisitions and divestitures and charges of $4.6 million and $14.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2019 was $502.2 million, an increase of $22.8 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2018. Gross profits were $19.6 million lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018, driven by increased input costs and transportation inflation, partially offset by supply chain realized productivity. Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2019 decreased by $24.6 million compared to fiscal 2018. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment included a gain of $23.1 million in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of our Italian-based frozen pasta business, Gelit.

International operating profit for fiscal 2019 was $94.5 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 9%, compared to fiscal 2018. Gross profits were flat in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Included in the International segment fiscal 2019 operating profit was a gain of $13.2 million related to the sale of our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada, charges of $13.1 million for the impairment of our Aylmer® and Sundrop® brand assets, and charges of $2.9 million related to divestitures. In addition, operating profit was impacted by charges of $1.9 million and $1.5 million in connection with our restructuring plans, in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2019 was $117.7 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2018. Gross profits were $8.5 million lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018, due to lower volume (including the sale of our Trenton, Missouri production facility) and higher input costs, partially offset by supply chain realized productivity.

Pinnacle Foods operating profit for fiscal 2019 (reflecting 213 days of Conagra Brands ownership) was $238.2 million. Operating profit for Pinnacle Foods during fiscal 2019 included incremental cost of goods sold of $53.0 million due to the impact of writing inventory to fair value as part of our acquisition accounting and the subsequent sale of that inventory, as well as charges of $5.9 million related to restructuring activities. 

Interest Expense, Net

In fiscal 2019, net interest expense was $391.4 million, an increase of $232.7 million, or 147%, from fiscal 2018. The increase reflected the following:

•the issuance of $7.025 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes and borrowings of $1.30 billion under our new unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a $650.0 million tranche of three-year term loans and a $650.0 million tranche of five-year term loans to the Company (the "Term Loan Agreement"), in each case in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition,

28

•the repayment of a total of $900.0 million of our borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019,

•the borrowing of $300.0 million under our prior term loan agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which borrowing was subsequently repaid in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition,

•the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2020 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, 

•the repayment of $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and

•the repayment of $119.6 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. 

 In addition, fiscal 2019 included $11.9 million related to the amortization of costs incurred to secure fully committed bridge financing in connection with the then-pending Pinnacle acquisition. The bridge financing was subsequently terminated in connection with our incurrence of permanent financing to fund the Pinnacle acquisition, and we recognized the remaining unamortized financing costs of $33.8 million within SG&A expenses.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense was $218.8 million and $174.6 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 24% and 18% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

As a result of our off-calendar fiscal year end, the lower U.S. statutory federal income tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 29.3% for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. 

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 reflects the following: 

•the impact of legal entity reorganization resulting in a benefit related to undistributed foreign earnings for which the indefinite reinvestment assertion is no longer made, 

•additional tax expense on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings,

•an adjustment of valuation allowance associated with the expected capital gains from the divestiture of the Wesson® oil and Gelit businesses, 

•additional tax expense on non-deductible facilitative costs associated with the Pinnacle acquisition, 

•a benefit recognized due to the non-taxability of the novation of a legacy guarantee, 

•a benefit recognized due to a reduction in the fair value of equity awards subject to limitations on deductibility that were issued to Pinnacle executives as replacement awards at the time of the acquisition, 

•an increase to the deemed repatriation tax liability, 

•additional tax expense due to foreign and domestic restructuring, and 

•a state tax benefit from integration of the Pinnacle business.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 reflects the following:

•the impact of the Tax Act, 

•an adjustment of valuation allowance associated with the termination of the agreement for the proposed divestiture of our Wesson® oil business, 

•an indirect cost of the pension contribution made on February 26, 2018, 

•additional expense related to the settlement of an audit of the impact of a law change in Mexico,  

•an income tax benefit allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of grant, and

•additional expense related to undistributed foreign earnings for which the indefinite reinvestment assertion is no longer made.

29

We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 24%-25%.

Equity Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were $75.8 million and $97.3 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Results for fiscal 2019 included a gain of $15.1 million from the sale of an asset by the Ardent Mills joint venture. In addition, Ardent Mills earnings for fiscal 2019 reflected lower commodity margins and the timing of certain customer contracts that negatively impacted performance. A benefit of $4.3 million was included in the earnings of fiscal 2018 in connection with a gain on the substantial liquidation of an international joint venture. 

Results of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated an after-tax loss of $1.9 million and a gain of $14.3 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. During fiscal 2018, a $14.5 million income tax benefit was recorded due to an adjustment of the estimated deductibility of the costs incurred associated with effecting the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. 

Earnings Per Share

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were $1.52, including earnings of $1.53 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $0.01 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 were $1.98, including earnings of $1.95 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations. See "Items Impacting Comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations. 

Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 

Net Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Overall, our net sales were $7.94 billion in fiscal 2018, an increase of 1% compared to fiscal 2017.

Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2018 were $3.29 billion, an increase of $78.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition contributed $8.6 million and the Thanasi acquisition contributed $66.5 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions. The Frontera and Thanasi acquisitions occurred in September 2016 and April 2017, respectively. 

Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2018 were $2.75 billion, an increase of $100.3 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of 

30

acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition, which occurred in September 2016, and subsequent innovation in the Frontera® brand contributed $4.4 million during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.

International net sales for fiscal 2018 were $843.5 million, an increase of $27.5 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% increase due to foreign exchange rates, and a 3% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2017. The volume decrease for fiscal 2018 was driven by strategic decisions to eliminate lower margin products and to reduce promotional intensity. The increase in price/mix compared to the prior-year period was driven by improvements in pricing and trade productivity.

Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2018 were $1.05 billion, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected an 11% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 9% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in volumes compared to the prior year primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business, the planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing businesses, and softness in certain categories. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2018 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value over volume strategy. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. Accordingly, there were no net sales in the Commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses had net sales of $71.1 million in fiscal 2017 prior to the completion of the divestitures. 

SG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.40 billion for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $75.6 million compared to fiscal 2017. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2018 reflected the following:

Items impacting comparability of earnings

•charges totaling $151.0 million related to certain litigation matters,

•a charge of $34.9 million related to the early termination of an unfavorable lease contract,

•expenses of $30.2 million in connection with our SCAE Plan,

•expenses of $15.1 million associated with costs incurred for acquisitions and divestitures, and

•charges totaling $4.8 million related to the impairment of other intangible assets.

•gains totaling $197.4 million, from the divestiture of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses,

•charges totaling $93.3 million related to the early retirement of debt,

•a charge of $67.1 million related to the impairment of the Chef Boyardee® brand intangible,

•expenses of $46.4 million in connection with our SCAE Plan,[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•a benefit of $5.7 million in connection with a legal matter.

Segment Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expenses, pension and postretirement non-service income, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $724.8 million, an increase of $69.4 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $21.9 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. The lower gross profit was driven by investments with retailers (i.e., trade spending reflected as a reduction of net sales), as well as higher input costs and transportation expenses, partially offset by supply chain realized productivity. The Frontera acquisition, Thanasi acquisition, and the acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which occurred in September 2016, April 2017, and October 2017, respectively, contributed $47.4 million to Grocery & Snacks gross profit during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions (if reached). Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $19.5 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by charges totaling $4.0 million in fiscal 2018 for the impairment of our HK Anderson®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brand assets and $68.3 million in fiscal 2017 primarily for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® brand asset. Grocery & Snacks also incurred $11.4 million of expenses in fiscal 2018 related to acquisitions and divestitures, charges of $31.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the pending divestiture of the Wesson® oil business, and charges of $14.1 million and $23.6 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $479.4 million, an increase of $33.6 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $3.6 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, driven by continuing increases in input costs and transportation inflation as well as investments to drive distribution, enhanced shelf presence, and trial, partially offset by increased sales volumes and supply chain realized productivity. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $4.6 million to gross profit in the segment during fiscal 2018. Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $23.4 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2017 related to a product recall, as well as charges of $0.1 million and $6.2 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

International operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $86.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $168.9 million for fiscal 2017. The operating loss in fiscal 2017 includes charges totaling $235.9 million for the impairment of goodwill and an intangible brand asset in our Canadian and Mexican operations. Gross profits were $18.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, as a result of improved price/mix, the favorable impact of foreign exchange, and the planned discontinuations of certain 

32

lower-performing products. Operating profit of the International segment was impacted by charges of $1.5 million and $0.9 million in connection with our restructuring plans, in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $121.8 million, an increase of $16.7 million, or 16%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $13.9 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing and supply chain realized productivity, partially offset by lower sales volumes and increased input costs. Operating profit of the Foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $1.8 million in fiscal 2017 in connection with our restructuring plans.

Commercial operating profit was $202.6 million in fiscal 2017. The Company sold the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, recognizing pre-tax gains totaling $197.4 million. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. There are no further operations in the Commercial segment. 

Interest Expense, Net

In fiscal 2018, net interest expense was $158.7 million, a decrease of $36.8 million, or 19%, from fiscal 2017. The decrease reflects the repayment of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, $473.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, $119.6 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as the exchange of $1.44 billion of debt in connection with the Spinoff of Lamb Weston during the second quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2020 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and the borrowing of $300.0 million under our term loan agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. For more information about the debt exchange, see Note 4 "Long-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense was $174.6 million and $254.7 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 18% for fiscal 2018 and 32% for fiscal 2017. 

The Tax Act was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The changes to U.S. tax law include, but are not limited to:

•reducing the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018;

•eliminating the deduction for domestic manufacturing activities, which began impacting us in fiscal 2019;

•requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries;

•repealing the exception for deductibility of performance-based compensation to covered employees, along with expanding the number of covered employees;

•allowing immediate expensing of machinery and equipment contracted for purchase after September 27, 2017; and

•changing taxation of multinational companies, including a new minimum tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, a new Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, and a new U.S. corporate deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income, all of which became effective for us beginning in 2019.

As a result of our off-calendar fiscal year-end, the lower U.S. statutory federal income tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 29.3% for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. Our federal statutory rate was 21% in fiscal 2019.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 reflects the following:

•the impact of U.S. tax reform, as noted above,

•an adjustment of valuation allowance associated with the termination of the agreement for the proposed sale of our Wesson® oil business,

•an indirect cost of the pension contribution made on February 26, 2018,

33

•additional expense related to the settlement of an audit of the impact of a law change in Mexico, 

•an income tax benefit allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of grant, and

•additional expense related to undistributed foreign earnings for which the indefinite reinvestment assertion is no longer made.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 reflects the following:

•additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill sold in connection with the divestitures of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses,

•additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill in our Mexican and Canadian businesses, for which an impairment charge was recognized,

•an income tax benefit for the adjustment of a valuation allowance associated with the planned divestiture of the Wesson® oil business,

•an income tax benefit for excess tax benefits allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of grant, and

•an income tax benefit associated with a tax planning strategy that allowed us to utilize certain state tax attributes and certain foreign incentives.

Equity Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were $97.3 million and $71.2 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. A benefit of $4.3 million was included in the earnings of fiscal 2018 in connection with a gain on the substantial liquidation of an international joint venture. In addition, Ardent Mills earnings were higher than they were in the prior-year periods due to more favorable market conditions and continued improvement in operating effectiveness.

Results of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $14.3 million and $102.0 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. During fiscal 2018, a $14.5 million income tax benefit was recorded due to an adjustment of the estimated deductibility of the costs incurred associated with effecting the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. The prior-year period results reflected the operations of Lamb Weston through the date of its Spinoff in November 2016. We incurred significant costs associated with effecting the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. These costs are included in results of discontinued operations. 

Earnings Per Share

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 were $1.98, including earnings of $1.95 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 were $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. See "Items Impacting Comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.

34

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources of Liquidity and Capital

The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. If necessary, we use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities), and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our non-current assets. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.

At May 26, 2019, we had a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.6 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion with the consent of the lenders). We have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of May 26, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

At May 26, 2019, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. The highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2019 was $408.7 million. As of May 27, 2018, we had $277.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. 

On October 22, 2018, in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition, we issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $7.025 billion. These notes were issued in seven tranches: floating rate senior notes due October 22, 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of $525.0 million with an interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.75%; 3.8% senior notes due October 22, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion; 4.3% senior notes due May 1, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion; 4.6% senior notes due November 1, 2025 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion; 4.85% senior notes due November 1, 2028 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion; 5.3% senior notes due November 1, 2038 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion; and 5.4% senior notes due November 1, 2048 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.

On October 26, 2018, in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our Term Loan Agreement. The three-year tranche loans mature on October 26, 2021, and the five-year tranche loans mature on October 26, 2023. The term loans bear interest at, at the Company's election, either (a) LIBOR plus a percentage spread (ranging from 1% to 1.625% for three-year tranche loans and 1.125% to 1.75% for five-year tranche loans) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term indebtedness ratings or (b) the alternate base rate, described in the Term Loan Agreement as the greatest of (i) Bank of America's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a percentage spread (ranging from 0% to 0.625% for three-year tranche loans and 0.125% to 0.75% for five-year tranche loans) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term indebtedness ratings.

The Company may voluntarily prepay term loans under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without penalty, subject to certain conditions. During fiscal 2019, we repaid $900.0 million of our borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, which consisted of $450.0 million of the three-year tranche loans and $450.0 million of the five-year tranche loans. Subsequent to fiscal 2019, we repaid an additional $100.0 million of the three-year tranche loans and $100.0 million of the five-year tranche loans.

The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Agreement generally require that our ratio of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) to interest expense not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA not exceed certain decreasing specified levels, ranging from 5.875 through the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 3.75 from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and thereafter. Each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 

As of the end of fiscal 2019, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult, or impossible. 

35

On October 12, 2018, we issued approximately 16.3 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of $555.7 million, net of related fees. 

Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and common stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were used for the payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, the repayment of Pinnacle debt acquired, the refinancing of certain Conagra Brands debt, and the payment of related fees and expenses. 

We repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. The Company plans to repurchase shares under its authorized program only at times and in amounts as are consistent with the prioritization of achieving its leverage targets. The Company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 26, 2019, was $1.41 billion. 

On April 16, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of $0.2125 per share, which was paid on May 31, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 30, 2019. Subject to market and other conditions and the approval of our Board of Directors, we intend to maintain our quarterly dividend at the current annual rate of $0.85 per share during fiscal 2020. 

We have access to our Revolving Credit Facility, our commercial paper program, and the capital markets. We believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities, if needed. 

We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance long-term debt upon maturity, as market conditions warrant, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions, access to capital markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility. 

Cash Flows

In fiscal 2019, we generated $108.6 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.13 billion generated from operating activities, $5.17 billion used in investing activities, $4.15 billion generated from financing activities, and a decrease of $0.7 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.11 billion in fiscal 2019, as compared to $919.7 million generated in fiscal 2018. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily the net result of decreased pension plan payments, additional cash generated from Pinnacle operations since the Pinnacle acquisition, proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps in fiscal 2019, reduced tax payments, and changes in working capital, partially offset by increased interest payments and costs associated with the Pinnacle acquisition. Pension plan payments in fiscal 2018 included a voluntary contribution totaling $300.0 million. Net income tax payment reductions totaling $30.3 million were impacted by corporate tax rate reductions resulting from the Tax Act signed into law during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Interest payments increased by $211.1 million resulting from debt issued in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition and the repayment of amounts accrued by Pinnacle prior to the acquisition. 

Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $5.17 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $576.2 million in fiscal 2018. Investing activities of continuing operations of fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of the purchase of Pinnacle for $5.12 billion, net of cash acquired, capital expenditures of $353.1 million, and proceeds from the divestiture of our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business, our Wesson® oil business, and our Italian-based frozen pasta business, Gelit, for combined proceeds of $281.5 million, net of cash divested. Investing activities in fiscal 2018 consisted mainly of the purchases of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business and Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC for a total of $337.1 million, net of cash acquired, and capital expenditures totaling $251.6 million. 

Cash generated from financing activities of continuing operations totaled $4.15 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $506.9 million used in financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition, we issued long-term debt that generated $8.31 billion in gross proceeds and issued common stock for net proceeds of $555.7 million. This was reduced by debt issuance costs and bridge financing fees totaling $95.2 million. We repaid $3.97 billion of long-term debt, reduced our short-term borrowings mainly related to our commercial paper program by $277.3 million, and paid cash dividends of $356.2 million. Financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2018 consisted principally of common stock repurchases totaling $967.3 million, gross proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt totaling 

36

$800.0 million, cash dividends paid of $342.3 million, repayments of long-term debt of $242.3 million, and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $249.1 million. 

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $236.6 million at May 26, 2019 and $128.0 million at May 27, 2018, of which $144.8 million at May 26, 2019, and $121.6 million at May 27, 2018, was held in foreign countries. We believe that our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest any undistributed earnings indefinitely, or that any undistributed earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction, and, therefore, do not provide deferred taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. 

Our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 is approximately $400 million. 

Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our repayment of debt, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in "Obligations and Commitments" below.

Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated

We lease or leased certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the "lease put options") that allow or allowed the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the "put price") in certain limited circumstances. As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options became exercisable. We are amortizing the difference between the put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of the property over the remaining lease term within SG&A expenses. During fiscal 2018, we purchased two buildings that were subject to lease put options and recognized net losses totaling $48.2 million for the early exit of unfavorable lease contracts. During fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired, and we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in SG&A expenses. 

As of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, there was one remaining leased building subject to a lease put option for which the put option price exceeded the estimated fair value of the property by $8.2 million, of which we had accrued $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease, and accordingly, there are no material assets and liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with this entity included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreement, the expected remaining useful life of the asset leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entity.

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $10.72 billion as of May 26, 2019, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.75 billion as of May 26, 2019, were not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

37

A summary of our contractual obligations as of May 26, 2019, was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Amount includes open purchase orders and agreements, some of which are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. Such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year. 

We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted-average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 26, 2019, was approximately 4.7%.

As of May 26, 2019, we had aggregate unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling $131.7 million and $87.8 million, respectively. These amounts are not included in the table above as the unfunded obligations are remeasured each fiscal year, thereby resulting in our inability to accurately predict the ultimate amount and timing of any future required contributions to such plans. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments of approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively. See Note 19 "Pension and Postretirement Benefits" to the consolidated financial statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates - Employment Related Benefits" contained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.

As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with U.S. GAAP, such commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 26, 2019, we had other commercial commitments totaling $5.3 million, of which $3.7 million expire in less than one year and $1.6 million expire in one to three years.

In addition to the other commercial commitments, as of May 26, 2019, we had $56.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on our behalf. These standby letters of credit are primarily related to our self-insured workers compensation programs and are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining terms of these arrangements did not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $1.2 million. In addition, we guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of May 26, 2019, the remaining term of this arrangement did not exceed eight years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $19.1 million.

We also guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the "Separation Agreement"), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.

Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject, at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb 

38

Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed Lamb Weston's performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease agreement, up to a maximum of $75.0 million. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the company, in the event that we were required to perform under the guaranty, would be largely mitigated.

The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019 was $44.1 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019, that, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate was $37.3 million. Recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.

Our Audit/Finance Committee has reviewed management's development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.

Marketing Costs—We offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly recorded as a reduction in revenue. The methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance. Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs, therefore, requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.

We have recognized trade promotion liabilities of $143.6 million as of May 26, 2019. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes—Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.

Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 15 "Pre-tax Income and Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.

Environmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third-party specialists in order 

39

to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean-up. Management's estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, management's estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.

We have recognized a reserve of approximately $56.8 million for environmental liabilities as of May 26, 2019. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. 

Employment-Related Benefits—We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation. In order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. 

Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company has elected to use a split discount rate (the "spot-rate approach") for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans. Historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs, both of which are components of pension benefit costs. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost. This change is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively. The pre-tax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately $27.0 million. 

We have recognized a pension liability of $192.9 million and $171.5 million, a postretirement liability of $90.6 million and $118.2 million, and a workers' compensation liability of $61.1 million and $39.4 million, as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We also have recognized a pension asset of $61.2 million and $103.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, as certain individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status.

We recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under U.S. GAAP. 

We recognized pension benefit, including activities of discontinued operations, from Company plans of $22.7 million, $56.1 million, and $12.9 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Such amounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability of $5.1 million, $3.4 million, and $1.2 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. This also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $174.4 million, $218.3 million, and $207.4 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We contributed $14.7 million, $312.6 million, and $163.0 million to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $14.2 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2020.

One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. We use a spot-rate approach, discussed above. This approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach.

Based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 4.15% for fiscal 2019, 3.90% for fiscal 2018, and 3.83% for fiscal 2017. We selected a weighted-average discount rate of 4.04% and 3.51% for determination of service and interest expense, respectively, for fiscal 2020. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2019 would have resulted in an increase of $4.0 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2019. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2019 would have resulted in a decrease 

40

of $4.3 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2019. For our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 3.88% and 4.14% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, we selected 5.17% for the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2019 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2019 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.2 million. We selected a weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.77% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2020. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2020 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.8 million.

During fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment of our salaried and non-qualified pension plans. The amendment froze the compensation and service periods used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in those plans. As a result of this amendment, we changed our salaried and non-qualified pension asset investment strategy to align our related pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility. 

In October 2016, The Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plan Experience Committee published updated mortality improvement scales and recommended their use with base mortality tables for the measurement of U.S. pension plan obligations. With the assistance of our third-party actuary, in measuring our pension obligations as of May 28, 2017, we incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables. 

 During 2018, we conducted a mortality experience study and, with the assistance of our third-party actuary, adopted new company-specific mortality tables used in measuring our pension obligations as of May 27, 2018. In addition, we incorporated a revised mortality improvement scale to be used with the new company-specific mortality tables that reflects the mortality improvement inherent in these tables. 

We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We recognized postretirement benefit expense (benefit) of $(1.3) million, $0.7 million, and $(1.2) million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We reflected liabilities of $90.6 million and $118.2 million in our balance sheets as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $10.8 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2020.

The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates (also discussed above), and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 3.81% for fiscal 2019, 3.33% for fiscal 2018, and 3.18% for fiscal 2017. We have selected a weighted-average discount rate of 3.48% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2020. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 7.20%, with the trend rate decreasing to 4.5% by 2024. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We provide workers' compensation benefits to our employees. The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. The weighted-average discount rate used at May 26, 2019 was 2.48%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers' compensation expense or the liability.

Business Combinations, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Identifiable Intangible Assets, and Goodwill—We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

We reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment) to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable. We generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated fair values. The estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group.

Determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. 

We reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets.

In assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

If we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks, we utilize a "relief from royalty" methodology. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated "royalty rate" we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. When determining the future cash flow estimates, we estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. 

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment 

42

has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. 

In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.

Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.

Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering expected long term growth rates and trends). Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any, to be recognized. In the second step, we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. As a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

As of May 26, 2019, we have goodwill of $11.50 billion, indefinite-lived intangibles of $3.68 billion, and definite-lived intangibles of $983.4 million. The amount of goodwill and intangibles increased significantly during fiscal 2019 as a result of the Pinnacle acquisition. During fiscal 2020, as part of our organizational realignment and integration activities, we intend to allocate Pinnacle intangibles to the applicable Conagra reporting units. Historically, we have experienced impairments in brand intangibles and goodwill as a result of declining sales and other economic conditions. For instance, in fiscal 2019 we recorded total intangibles impairments of $89.6 million, primarily related to our Chef Boyardee® brand intangible. With the addition of Pinnacle intangibles, we have significant indefinite-lived brand intangibles such as Birds Eye®, Duncan Hines®, and Wishbone®, among others, that were recorded at fair value in purchase accounting. Accordingly, we could be more susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our long-term sales forecasts and other assumptions change as a result of lower than expected performance or other economic conditions. We currently believe that the fair value of each intangible asset equals or exceeds its carrying value.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, Topic 842, which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have identified an accounting system to support the future state lease accounting process and continue to develop the future state process design as part of the overall system implementation. We have populated the accounting system with lease data and have validated the completeness and accuracy of such data. We expect the adoption of this standard to result in an increase in total assets and liabilities related to operating

leases that are currently not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, however, we do not expect there to be a material impact to our earnings or cash flows. See Note 16 "Leases" to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for the total amount of our noncancelable operating lease commitments. The standard can be applied using the modified retrospective method or entities may also elect the optional transition method provided under ASU 2018-11, Leases, Topic 842: Targeted Improvement, issued in July 2018, allowing for application of the standard at the adoption date, with recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2020 using the optional transition method and will elect certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical classification of leases. 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We do not expect ASU 2018-15 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
