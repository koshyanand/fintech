Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW 

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," as well as the information contained in "Risk Factors." 

Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Executive Summary

We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.

In 2019, we announced our plan to divest our Campbell Fresh operating segment and international biscuits and snacks operating segment. Within our Campbell Fresh operating segment, on February 25, 2019, we sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business, and on April 25, 2019, we sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business. Proceeds were approximately $55 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On June 16, 2019, we also sold our Bolthouse Farms business for approximately $500 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reflected in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 29, 2018. A portion of the U.S. refrigerated soup business historically included in Campbell Fresh was retained, and is now reported in Meals & Beverages. 

Within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Kelsen business on July 12, 2019, and completed the sale on September 23, 2019, for approximately $300 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We also signed a definitive agreement on August 1, 2019, for the sale of our Arnott’s business and certain other international operations, including the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages businesses in Australia and Asia Pacific (the Arnott's and international operations), for $2.2 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We expect to complete the sale in the first half of 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the Kelsen business and the Arnott’s and international operations (collectively referred to as Campbell International) as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reflected in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 28, 2019, and July 29, 2018. These businesses were historically included in the Global Biscuits and Snacks reportable segment. See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these recently completed and pending divestitures and reportable segments. 

In addition, on September 18, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our European chips business for £66 million, or approximately $80 million. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions including receiving the relevant regulatory approvals, and we expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2020. 

We used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the businesses sold in 2020 to further reduce debt.

Our simple meals and shelf-stable beverages business in Latin America was managed as part of the Snacks segment in 2018 and the Meals & Beverages segment in 2019. Segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. In 2020, our Latin America business is managed as part of the Snacks segment. See "Business - Reportable Segments" for a description of the products included in each segment.

Strategy 

Our strategy is to deliver long-term sustainable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within North America while delivering on the promise of our purpose - Real food that matters for life’s moments.

We plan to revise our consumer and customer engagement models through the development of more defined consumer-oriented portfolio roles for our products and increase prioritizing of retailers, which we believe will create a more profitable growth model. In addition, we expect to increase focus on the growth of our snacks business. We also intend to dedicate additional investment in U.S. soup and support our core brands through a revised marketing and innovation model tailored to specific categories and targeted customers and consumers.

We will continue pursuing our multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022 , which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance). We expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization, 

16 

organization consolidation and integration, procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories. See "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives. 

In addition, we will pursue a more focused and diverse organization that supports our core brands in North America. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we made an organizational change that streamlined our business into a two-division operating model, with differentiated resources and capabilities that we believe will best support the brands within each division. 

Business Trends

Our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: changing consumer preferences; a competitive and dynamic retail environment; and cost inflation.

Our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume. We also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and well-being, including naturally functional and organic foods.

Retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms. We expect consolidations among retailers will continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share. In addition, our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We anticipate that alternative retail channels, particularly e-commerce, will continue to grow rapidly. 

The cost of distribution has increased due to a rise in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess demand, reduced availability and higher fuel costs. In addition, certain ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by tariffs and weather-related events. We expect these cost pressures to continue in 2020. 

Summary of Results 

 As noted above, in 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of Campbell Fresh and Campbell International as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. 

In 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. Certain amounts in 2017 were reclassified. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2019 Compared with 2018

The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:

Continuing Operations

•In 2019, we recognized losses of $122 million in Other expenses / (income) ($93 million after tax, or $.31 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. In 2018, we recognized gains of $131 million in Other expenses / (income) ($100 million after tax, or $.33 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;

•In 2019, we recognized a pre-tax pension settlement charge in Other expenses / (income) of $28 million ($22 million after tax, or $.07 per share) associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlement resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2019;

•In 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. In 2017, we expanded these cost savings initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network, primarily in North America, continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies, and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions. In January 2018, as part of the expanded initiatives, we authorized additional costs to improve the operational efficiency of our thermal supply chain network in North America by closing our manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, and to optimize our information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform. In August 2018, we announced that we will continue to streamline our organization, expand our zero-based budgeting efforts and optimize our manufacturing network. In 2019, we began to include costs associated with the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration with these initiatives. In 2019, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $31 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $62 million in Administrative expenses, $18 million in Cost of products sold, $7 million in Marketing and selling expenses, and $3 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $92 million after tax, or $.30 per share) related to these initiatives. In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $42 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $87 million in Administrative expenses, $45 million in Cost of products sold, and $3 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $132 million after tax, or $.44 per share) related to these initiatives. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information;

•In 2019 and 2018, we reflected the impact on taxes of the enactment of the Act that was signed into law in December 2017. In 2019, we recorded a tax charge of $2 million ($.01 per share) related to a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings. In 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $179 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a tax charge of $53 million related to a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings. The net impact was a tax benefit of $126 million ($.42 per share). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Taxes on Earnings" for additional information;

•In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed an assessment on the assets within the European chips business and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $16 million ($13 million after tax, or $.04 per share) on intangible assets in Other expenses / (income). In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed an impairment assessment on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after tax, or $.14 per share) in Other expenses / (income). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information;

•In the second quarter of 2018, we announced our intent to acquire Snyder's-Lance and on March 26, 2018, the acquisition closed. In 2018, we incurred $120 million of transaction and integration costs, of which $13 million was recorded in Restructuring charges, $12 million in Administrative expenses, $53 million in Other expenses / (income), and $42 million in Cost of products sold associated with an acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. We also recorded a gain in Interest expense of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the acquisition. The aggregate impact was $102 million, $73 million after tax, or $.24 per share; and

•In 2018, we recorded expense of $22 million in Other expenses / (income) ($15 million after tax, or $.05 per share) from a settlement of a legal claim.

Discontinued Operations

•In 2019, we recognized losses of $12 million ($9 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, we recognized gains of $5 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) associated with mark-to-market and curtailment adjustments for defined benefit pension plans;

18 

•In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $7 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $1 million in Administrative expenses (aggregate impact of $4 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to the cost savings initiatives discussed above. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information; 

•In the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in Kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business. The aggregate impact was $17 million ($12 million after tax, or $.04 per share).

In the second quarter of 2019, interim impairment assessments were performed on the intangible and tangible assets within Campbell Fresh, which included Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, as we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses. We revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses as the divestiture process progressed. We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $104 million on the tangible assets and $73 million on the intangible assets of Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients; $96 million on the intangible assets and $9 million on the tangible assets of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings; and $62 million on the intangible assets and $2 million on the tangible assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $346 million ($264 million after tax, or $.88 per share). 

In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million ($11 million after tax, or $.04 per share) on our U.S. refrigerated soup plant assets. 

In 2019, total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $377 million ($287 million after tax, or $.95 per share). 

In the third quarter of 2018, we performed interim impairment assessments within Campbell Fresh on the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business, and the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. Within the deli unit, we revised our long-term outlook due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with certain private label customers, as well as the performance of the business. In addition, the operating performance of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was below expectations. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and cash flows for each of these reporting units. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11 million on the tangible assets and $94 million on the intangible assets ($80 million after tax, or $.27 per share) of the deli reporting unit, and a non-cash impairment charge of $514 million ($417 million after tax, or $1.39 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $619 million ($497 million after tax, or $1.65 per share). 

In the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. We revised our outlook for future earnings and cash flows and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $75 million ($74 million after tax, or $.25 per share). 

In 2018, the total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $694 million ($571 million after tax, or $1.89 per share); and

•In 2019, we incurred pre-tax expenses of $32 million associated with the sale process of the businesses in Campbell Fresh, including transaction costs. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $29 million as deferred tax assets on Bolthouse Farms were not realizable. The aggregate impact was $51 million after tax, or $.17 per share. In 2019, we also incurred costs of $12 million ($10 million after tax, or $.03 per share) associated with the planned divestiture of Campbell International. The total aggregate impact was $61 million after tax, or $.20 per share.

The items impacting comparability are summarized below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________________________________________

(1) Sum of the individual amounts may not add due to rounding.

Earnings from continuing operations were $474 million ($1.57 per share) in 2019, compared to $724 million ($2.40 per share) in 2018. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings decreased reflecting higher interest expense, partly offset by a lower adjusted tax rate as incremental earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from the Snyder’s-Lance acquisition were mostly offset by declines in EBIT in the base business.

See "Discontinued Operations" for additional information.

Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2018 Compared with 2017 

In addition to the 2018 items that impacted comparability of Net earnings discussed above, the following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:

•In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $11 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $33 million in Administrative expenses and $4 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $30 million after tax, or $.10 per share) related to the cost savings initiatives discussed above. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information; and

•In 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $52 million ($.17 per share) in Taxes on earnings primarily related to the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution, which resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange losses on the notes for tax purposes. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Discontinued Operations

•In 2017, we recognized gains of $22 million ($16 million after tax, or $.05 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension plans; 

20 

•In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $7 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $3 million in Administrative expenses (aggregate impact of $7 million after tax, or $.02 per share) related to the cost savings initiatives discussed above. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information; 

•In the second quarter of 2017, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit as operating performance was well below expectations and a new leadership team of the Campbell Fresh division initiated a strategic review which led to a revised outlook for future sales, earnings, and cash flow. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $147 million ($139 million after tax, or $.45 per share) related to intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and a non-cash impairment charge of $65 million ($41 million after tax, or $.13 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit (aggregate pre-tax impact of $212 million, $180 million after tax, or $.59 per share); and

The items impacting comparability are summarized below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________________________________________

(1) Sum of the individual amounts may not add due to rounding.

Earnings from continuing operations were $724 million ($2.40 per share) in 2018, compared to $924 million ($3.01 per share) in 2017. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings decreased primarily due to declines on the base business reflecting a lower gross profit performance, and the dilutive impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, reflecting share repurchases. We suspended our share repurchases as of the second quarter of 2018.

In 2019, Meals & Beverages sales were comparable with prior year reflecting a 2-point benefit from the acquisition of Pacific Foods, partially offset by declines in U.S. soup, the retail business in Canada driven by the negative impact of currency translation and Prego pasta sauces. Excluding Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup decreased 2% due to declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth. The decline in U.S. soup was driven primarily by continued competitive pressure across the market as well as increased promotional spending. 

In 2018, Meals & Beverages sales decreased 1% primarily due to declines in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of Pacific Foods, and an increase in the retail business in Canada driven by the favorable impact of currency translation. Excluding Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup declined 8%, driven by declines in condensed soups, ready-to-serve soups and broth. The decline in U.S. soup was primarily due to a key customer’s different promotional approach for soup in 2018. 

In 2019, Snacks sales increased 64% with a 61-point benefit from the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance, sales increased reflecting growth in Pepperidge Farm, with gains in Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery products and in cookies, as well as Kettle Brand potato chips, Late July snacks and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps.

In 2018, Snacks sales increased 54% primarily due to the 52-point benefit of the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. Excluding Snyder’s-Lance, sales increased primarily due to gains in Pepperidge Farm, reflecting growth in Goldfish crackers and in cookies.

Gross Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $319 million in 2019 from 2018 and decreased by $68 million in 2018 from 2017. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 33.2% in 2019, 35.9% in 2018 and 41.8% in 2017. 

22 

The 2.7 and 5.9 percentage-point decrease in gross profit percentage in 2019 and 2018, respectively, were due to the following factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________________________________________

(1) 2019 includes a positive margin impact of 0.8 from cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including higher than expected distribution costs associated with the startup of a new distribution facility in Findlay, Ohio, operated by a third-party logistics provider. 2018 includes a positive margin impact of 0.5 from cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including higher transportation and logistics costs.

(2) 2019 includes a positive margin impact of 0.6 from lapping the 2018 negative margin impact of 0.7 from a Snyder's-Lance acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory.

Marketing and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 10.4% in 2019, 11.0% in 2018 and 11.6% in 2017. Marketing and selling expenses increased 16% in 2019 from 2018. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 19 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 2 percentage points) and higher costs related to costs savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points) and lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 3 percentage points). The reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expenses was primarily in Meals & Beverages, reflecting a reallocation from advertising to promotional spending classified as revenue reductions, reduced support levels in light of distribution challenges faced in the first quarter and a later start to our U.S. soup campaign relative to the prior year.

Marketing and selling expenses increased 8% in 2018 from 2017. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 12 percentage points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points) and lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 1 percentage point).

Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.5% in 2019, 8.5% in 2018 and 7.7% in 2017. Administrative expenses increased 8% in 2019 from 2018. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 10 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 7 percentage points); and costs associated with the proxy contest (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives inclusive of acquisition integration costs (approximately 7 percentage points) and increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points).

Administrative expenses increased 26% in 2018 from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher costs related to cost savings initiatives (approximately 12 percentage points); the impact of acquisitions (approximately 9 percentage points); acquisition integration costs (approximately 3 percentage points); consulting costs incurred in connection with the strategic review (approximately 2 percentage points); investments in long-term innovation (approximately 1 percentage point); and inflation and other factors (approximately 4 percentage points), partially offset by lower incentive compensation (approximately 5 percentage points).

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses were $91 million in 2019 and 2018 as higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 8 percentage points) were mostly offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 7 percentage points).

Research and development expenses decreased $2 million, or 2%, in 2018 from 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower investments in long-term innovation (approximately 3 percentage points); and lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions (approximately 3 percentage points).

23 

Other Expenses / (Income)

Other expenses in 2019 included the following:

•$71 million of net periodic benefit expense, including losses of $122 million on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments and a pension settlement charge of $28 million associated with a U.S. pension plan;

•$48 million of amortization of intangible assets; and

•non-cash impairment charge of $16 million related to the European chips business.

An analysis of operating earnings by segment follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________________________________________

(1)See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.

Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages decreased 9% in 2019 versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to higher levels of cost inflation and higher warehousing and transportation costs, as well as higher promotional spending and higher incentive compensation expenses, partly offset by supply chain productivity improvements, lower marketing and selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives. 

Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages decreased 12% in 2018 versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage and lower sales volume, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit performance was impacted by cost inflation, including higher transportation and logistics costs, and the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Pacific Foods.

Operating earnings from Snacks increased 34% in 2019 versus 2018. The increase reflects a 32-point benefit from the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher sales, supply chain productivity improvements and lower promotional spending, partly offset by higher marketing and selling expenses, higher levels of cost inflation and higher incentive compensation expenses. Operating earnings benefited from lapping the costs associated with the voluntary product recall of Flavor Blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.

Operating earnings from Snacks increased 24% in 2018 versus 2017. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance, higher organic sales volume and lower marketing and selling expenses, partly offset by a lower 

24 

gross profit percentage. Gross profit performance was impacted by higher levels of cost inflation, higher transportation and logistics costs and costs associated with the voluntary product recall of Flavor Blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.

Corporate in 2019 included the following:

•$122 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments;

•costs of $90 million related to the cost savings initiatives;

•a pension settlement charge of $28 million associated with a U.S. pension plan; and

•non-cash impairment charge of $16 million related to the European chips business.

Corporate in 2018 included the following:

•costs of $135 million related to the cost savings initiatives;

•transaction and integration costs of $107 million associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•$22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim; and

•$131 million of gains on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments.

Excluding these amounts, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.

Corporate in 2017 included costs of $37 million related to cost savings initiatives and $156 million of gains associated with pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these amounts, the remaining increase in costs in 2018 was primarily due to higher administrative expenses and losses on open commodity contracts in 2018, partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit income in 2018.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased to $356 million in 2019 from $183 million in 2018. The increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions, higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio and a gain of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts in the prior year used to hedge the planned financing of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition.

Interest expense increased to $183 million in 2018 from $115 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partially offset by a gain of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition.

Taxes on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 24.2% in 2019, 12.8% in 2018 and 29.8% in 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation. As a result, the following items are reflected in 2018:

•The corporate rate reduction as of January 1, 2018, resulted in a blended U.S. statutory tax rate of approximately 27%;

•Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $179 million; and

•Imposition of a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings resulted in a tax charge of $53 million.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Tax expense increased from $106 million in 2018 to $151 million in 2019.

The following items impacted 2019 and 2018:

•In 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $29 million on $122 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market losses. In 2018, we recognized tax expense of $31 million on $131 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market gains; 

•In 2019, we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on $28 million of a pension settlement charge;

•In 2019, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $121 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs. In 2018, we recognized a $45 million tax benefit on $177 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs;

•In 2019, we recognized a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings of $2 million related to the enactment of the Act. In 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $126 million related to the enactment of the Act on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings described above; 

25 

•In 2019, we recognized a $3 million tax benefit on a $16 million impairment charge on the European chips business. In 2018, we recognized a $13 million tax benefit on a $54 million impairment charge on the Plum trademark;

•In 2018, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $102 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance; and

•In 2018, we recognized a $7 million tax benefit on the $22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim. 

After adjusting for the items above, the remaining decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower U.S. federal tax rate resulting from the enactment of the Act in December 2017.

Tax expense decreased from $392 million in 2017 to $106 million in 2018.

The following items impacted the tax rate in 2017: 

•In 2017, we recognized a tax expense of $56 million on $156 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market gains;

• In 2017, we recognized an $18 million tax benefit on $48 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs; and

•In 2017, we recognized a tax benefit of $52 million primarily related to the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution, which resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange losses on the notes for tax purposes.

After adjusting for the items above, the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower U.S. federal tax rate as a result of the Act.

Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives

2015 Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration

In fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. As part of these initiatives, we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain U.S.-based salaried employees nearing retirement who met age, length-of-service and business unit/function criteria.

In February 2017, we announced that we were expanding these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network, primarily in North America, continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies, and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions. In January 2018, as part of the expanded initiatives, we authorized additional pre-tax costs to improve the operational efficiency of our thermal supply chain network in North America by closing our manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, and to optimize our information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform. In August 2018, we announced that we will continue to streamline our organization, expand our zero-based budgeting efforts and optimize our manufacturing network. 

On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, in April 2017, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We expect to continue to implement this program and to achieve a majority of the program's targeted savings. In addition, we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate Snyder's-Lance.

Cost estimates, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.

A summary of pre-tax charges recorded in Earnings from continuing operations related to both programs is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(1) Includes $19 million of severance pay and benefits and $4 million of implementation costs and other related costs.

As of April 28, 2019, we incurred substantially all of the costs for actions associated with discontinued operations. All of the costs were cash expenditures.

A summary of the pre-tax costs in Earnings from continuing operations associated with both programs is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(1)  Includes $13 million of charges associated with the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration recognized in 2018.

(2) Includes $12 million of charges associated with the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration recognized in 2018.

The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified under both programs are approximately $615 million to $665 million. This estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed.

We expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date under both programs to consist of the following: approximately $205 million to $210 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $65 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $345 million to $390 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 35%; Snacks - approximately 40%; and Corporate - approximately 25%.

Of the aggregate $615 million to $665 million of pre-tax costs associated with continuing operations identified to date under both programs, we expect approximately $540 million to $590 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $395 million in capital expenditures through 2021, of which we invested approximately $250 million as of July 28, 2019. The capital expenditures primarily relate to the U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder’s-Lance manufacturing network, implementation of an SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products, and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network. 

We expect to incur substantially all of the costs for the actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date through 2020 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.

We expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date under both programs to generate pre-tax savings of $710 million in 2020, and once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $850 million by the end of 2022. The annual pre-tax savings associated with continuing operations generated by both programs were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The initiatives for actions associated with discontinued operations generated pre-tax savings of over $90 million in 2019 and $60 million in 2018.

27 

Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs in Earnings from continuing operations associated with segments is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(1)  Includes $25 million of pre-tax costs associated with the Snacks segment recognized in 2018 related to the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Discontinued Operations

On August 30, 2018, we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of businesses within two operating segments: our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, which includes Arnott’s, Kelsen and our operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan; and the Campbell Fresh operating segment, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business.

On February 25, 2019, we sold our U.S. refrigerated soup business, and on April 25, 2019, we sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business. Proceeds were approximately $55 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On June 16, 2019, we sold our Bolthouse Farms business. Proceeds were approximately $500 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented.

Within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Kelsen business on July 12, 2019, and completed the sale on September 23, 2019, for approximately $300 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We also signed a definitive agreement on August 1, 2019, for the sale of the Arnott’s and international operations, for $2.2 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We expect to complete the sale in the first half of 2020. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the Kelsen business and the Arnott’s and international operations, or Campbell International, as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. These businesses were historically included in the Global Biscuits and Snacks reportable segment. 

Results of discontinued operations were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2019, Campbell Fresh sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the businesses, as well as declines in refrigerated soup, Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and Garden Fresh Gourmet.

In 2018, Campbell Fresh sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in carrot ingredients and Garden Fresh Gourmet were offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages.

28 

In 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded impairment charges on the reporting units in Campbell Fresh. See "Significant Accounting Estimates" for additional information. In 2019, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $360 million ($275 million after tax, or $.91 per share). In 2018 and 2017, the total non-cash impairment charges were $694 million ($571 million after tax, or $1.89 per share) and $212 million ($180 million after tax, or $.59 per share), respectively. In 2019, we incurred pre-tax expenses of $32 million associated with the sale process of the businesses, including transaction costs. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $29 million in the third quarter as deferred tax assets associated with Bolthouse Farms were not realizable. In 2018, loss from operations included a benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.

In 2019, Campbell International sales decreased reflecting the negative impact of currency translation and declines in Kelsen cookies in the U.S.

In 2018, Campbell International sales increased due to the favorable impact from currency translation. Excluding the impact from currency translation, sales decreased with declines in Arnott’s biscuits in Indonesia, partly offset by gains in Kelsen cookies in China.

In 2019, excluding items impacting comparability, earnings from Campbell International declined primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage, reflecting higher supply chain costs and higher promotional spending, as well as the negative impact of currency translation.

In 2018, earnings from Campbell International declined primarily due to higher interest expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.

In August 2018, we announced the results of our comprehensive Board of Directors-led strategy and portfolio review, which included plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and our Campbell Fresh operating segment. We sold Campbell Fresh in 2019 as further described below. Within our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Kelsen business on July 12, 2019, and completed the sale on September 23, 2019, for approximately $300 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We also signed a definitive agreement on August 1, 2019, for the sale of the Arnott’s and international operations for $2.2 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and expect to complete the sale in the first half of 2020. In addition, on September 18, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our European chips business for £66 million, or approximately $80 million. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions including receiving the relevant regulatory approvals, and we expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of 2020. 

We used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the businesses sold in 2020 to further reduce debt.

In addition, we plan to continue driving improved asset efficiency in working capital and capital expenditures to generate cash. We expect to maintain disciplined cash flow and capital allocation priorities in 2020, including for capital investments, our dividend and debt reduction. 

We generated cash flows from operations of $1.398 billion in 2019, compared to $1.305 billion in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to improvements in working capital management efforts and higher cash earnings.

We generated cash flows from operations of $1.305 billion in 2018, compared to $1.288 billion in 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to lower working capital requirements, partially offset by lower cash earnings.

Current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements while extending payment terms for accounts payables. We had negative working capital of $1.418 billion as of July 28, 2019, and $1.298 billion as of July 29, 2018. Total debt maturing within one year was $1.603 billion as of July 28, 2019, and $1.896 billion as of July 29, 2018.

Capital expenditures were $384 million in 2019, $407 million in 2018 and $338 million in 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $350 million in 2020. Capital expenditures in 2019 included a U.S. warehouse optimization project, replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system, transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants, a Snyder's-Lance regional distribution center, a Milano cookie capacity expansion project, and a Goldfish cracker capacity expansion project. Capital expenditures in 2018 included a U.S. warehouse optimization project; transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants; insourcing manufacturing for certain simple meal products; replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system; and an Australian multi-pack biscuit capacity expansion project. Capital expenditures in 2017 included projects to expand: Australian multi-pack biscuit capacity; beverage and salad dressing capacity at Bolthouse Farms; and capacity at Garden Fresh; as well as the continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters; replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system; and a U.S. warehouse optimization project.

29 

Pepperidge Farm and Snyder’s-Lance have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. In order to maintain and expand this model, we routinely purchase and sell routes. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities. 

On December 12, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pacific Foods. The purchase price was $688 million and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. 

On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. Total consideration was $6.112 billion, which included the payoff of approximately $1.1 billion of Snyder's-Lance indebtedness. We borrowed $900 million under a single draw 3-year senior unsecured term loan facility on March 26, 2018, and issued $5.3 billion senior notes on March 16, 2018, to finance the acquisition. The interest rate on the senior unsecured term loan facility resets in one, two, three, or six-month periods dependent upon our election. Interest on the senior unsecured term loan facility is due upon the earlier of an interest reset or quarterly. The senior unsecured term loan facility contains customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type and a maximum leverage ratio covenant. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we prepaid $401 million of the facility. As a result of such prepayment, the maximum leverage ratio covenant in the senior unsecured term loan facility no longer applies and is no longer incorporated into our U.S. credit facility. The remaining debt outstanding under the senior unsecured term loan facility may be prepaid at par at any time. 

The $5.3 billion senior notes were issued in various tenors in both fixed and floating rate formats. We issued 2 and 3-year floating rate senior notes in the amount of $500 million and $400 million, respectively. We issued 3, 5, 7, 10, and 30-year fixed rate senior notes in the amount of $650 million, $1.2 billion, $850 million, $1 billion, and $700 million, respectively. Interest on the 2-year floating rate senior notes is due quarterly on March 16, June 16, September 16, and December 16, commencing on June 16, 2018. Interest on the 3-year floating rate senior notes is due quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2018. Interest on the fixed rate senior notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, commencing on September 15, 2018. The fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option at any time at the applicable redemption price. If change of control triggering events occur, we will be required to offer to purchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. The senior notes were issued under a shelf registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2017. We registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions.

On October 30, 2018, we purchased the remaining ownership interest in Yellow Chips Holdings B.V., and began consolidating the business. The purchase price was $18 million.

On February 25, 2019, we sold our U.S refrigerated soup business, and on April 25, 2019, we sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business. Proceeds were approximately $55 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On June 16, 2019, we sold Bolthouse Farms. Proceeds were approximately $500 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. 

In June 2017, we sold intercompany notes to a financial institution, including an AUD $280 million, or $224 million, note with an interest rate of 4.88% due on September 18, 2018, and an AUD $190 million, or $152 million, note with an interest rate of 6.98% due on March 29, 2021, but payable upon demand. Interest on both notes was due semi-annually on January 23 and July 23. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. On September 18, 2018, we repaid a portion of both Australian notes and refinanced the remainder with a new AUD $400 million, or $296 million, single-draw syndicated facility that matured on September 11, 2019. As of July 28, 2019, the balance outstanding under this facility was AUD $335 million, or $232 million. The syndicated facility was repaid in August 2019 and was terminated. 

Dividend payments were $423 million in 2019, $426 million in 2018 and $420 million in 2017. Annual dividends declared were $1.40 per share in 2019, 2018, and 2017. The 2019 fourth quarter dividend was $.35 per share.

We repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $86 million in 2018, and approximately 8 million shares at a cost of $437 million in 2017. As a result of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, we suspended our share repurchases as of the second quarter of 2018. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

As of July 28, 2019, we had $1.603 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $853 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings and $232 million was outstanding under the Australian syndicated facility. As of July 28, 2019, we issued $46 million of standby letters of credit. We have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.85 billion that matures in December 2021. This U.S. facility remained unused at July 28, 2019, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. The U.S. facility supports our commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.

We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of July 28, 2019. For additional information on debt, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long-term liabilities, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(1) Excludes build-to-suit lease commitment, unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs. Includes debt obligations of $238 million related to discontinued operations. For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Interest payments for short- and long-term borrowings are based on principal amounts and coupons or contractual rates at fiscal year end. Includes interest payments of $3 million related to discontinued operations.

(3) Represents payments of foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity contracts.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(5) Represents other long-term liabilities, excluding unrecognized tax benefits, postretirement benefits and payments related to pension plans. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

We guarantee approximately 2,000 bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $220 million. We guarantee approximately 2,400 bank loans made to Snyder's-Lance independent contract distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The outstanding aggregate balance on these loans was $194 million as of July 28, 2019. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.

 See also Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements. 

INFLATION

We are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold. We use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives. 

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Net sales of continuing operations outside of the U.S. are concentrated principally in Canada and represent approximately 8% of 2019 net sales. Within discontinued operations, international sales are concentrated principally in Australia. We manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into cross-currency swaps 

31 

and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. 

We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of soybean oil, wheat, diesel fuel, aluminum, natural gas, soybean meal, corn, cocoa, butter, and cheese, which impact the cost of raw materials.

The information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of July 28, 2019. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13, 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt represent the weighted-average rates at July 28, 2019. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________

(1) Expected maturities exclude build-to-suit lease commitment, unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances and debt issuance costs.

(2) Represents $6.253 billion of USD borrowings and $7 million equivalent of borrowings in other currencies.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of July 29, 2018, fixed-rate debt of approximately $6.906 billion with an average interest rate of 4.10% and variable-rate debt of approximately $3.052 billion with an average interest rate of 2.86% were outstanding. 

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted-average contract exchange rates as of July 28, 2019. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We had an additional number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies with a notional value of $1.3 million as of July 28, 2019. The notional values of these smaller contracts, as well as Receive AUD/Pay NZD, Receive DKK/Pay USD and Receive GBP/Pay AUD, referenced in the table above, are associated with discontinued operations. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $3 million as of July 28, 2019. The total notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was $244 million, and the aggregate fair value was a gain of $2 million as of July 29, 2018.

We enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of July 28, 2019, the notional value of these contracts was $183 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $3 million. As of July 29, 2018, the notional value of these contracts was $118 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $1 million. 

32 

We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index Institutional Plus Shares, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either: the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index Institutional Plus Shares; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $7 million at July 28, 2019, and $8 million at July 29, 2018. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in April 2020, was 1.84% at July 28, 2019. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was $17 million at July 28, 2019, and $23 million at July 29, 2018. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2020, was 1.47% at July 28, 2019. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $7 million at July 28, 2019, and $10 million at July 29, 2018. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2020, was 1.44% at July 28, 2019. As of July 28, 2019 and July 29, 2018 the fair value of these contracts was a gain of $1 million.

Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: 

Trade and consumer promotion programs — We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. We adopted revised guidance on the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2019. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Valuation of long-lived assets — Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. 

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. In January 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the revised guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value. Prior to the revised guidance, the amount of the impairment was the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the "implied" fair value, which was calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.

2017 Assessments

Discontinued Operations

During the second quarter of 2017, sales and operating profit performance for Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients were well below our expectations due to difficulty with regaining market share lost during 2016 and higher carrot costs from the adverse impact of heavy rains on crop yields. During the quarter, we also lowered our forecast for sales and earnings for the reporting unit for the second half of 2017 based on revised market share recovery expectations and the continuing effect of unusual weather conditions on carrot costs. In addition, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of Campbell Fresh during the second quarter, we decided to reduce emphasis on growing sales of carrot ingredients, which are a by-product of the manufacturing process, and to manage carrots sold at retail for modest sales growth consistent with the category while improving profitability. Accordingly, we reduced our expectations for recovery of retail carrot market share. As a consequence of the business performance and the strategic review, we lowered our sales outlook for future fiscal years.We also lowered our average margin expectations due in part to cost volatility, which has been higher than expected. Based upon the business performance in the second quarter of 2017, our reduced near-term outlook, and reduced expectations for sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows, we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter, which resulted in a $127 million impairment charge on goodwill and $20 million on a trademark in the reporting unit. 

We acquired Garden Fresh Gourmet on June 29, 2015. During 2017, sales and operating profit performance for Garden Fresh Gourmet, a reporting unit within the Campbell Fresh segment, were well below expectations, and we lowered our outlook for the second half of 2017 due to customer losses and failure to meet product distribution goals. We expected to expand distribution of salsa beyond our concentration in the Midwest region, however this proved to be challenging as differentiated recipes are required to meet taste profiles in other parts of the country. In addition, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of Campbell Fresh during the second quarter, we lowered our distribution and category growth expectations and, therefore, future sales outlook. Based upon the business performance in 2017, our reduced near-term outlook, and reduced expectations for sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows, we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter, which resulted in a $64 million impairment charge on goodwill and $1 million on a trademark in the reporting unit. 

2018 Assessments

Discontinued Operations

During the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. The business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols, which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs. This cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short- and long-term margin expectations for this business. Based on this performance, we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit. The fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value, which was $48 million. 

During the third quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business within Campbell Fresh. During the third quarter of 2018, certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers, which represent a majority of the business, informed us of their intention to in-source production beginning in 2019, and the sales and operating profit outlook of the Garden Fresh Gourmet business was reduced. Due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers, as well as the recent performance of the Garden Fresh Gourmet business, we revised the long-term outlook for future sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit, which resulted in an $81 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, $13 million on a trademark, and $11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit.

In addition, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit within the Campbell Fresh segment as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations. We assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remain with the unit. This revised outlook resulted in a $384 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, and $130 million on a trademark in the reporting unit.

Continuing Operations

In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $54 million on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales.

2019 Assessments

Discontinued Operations

On August 30, 2018, we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the Campbell Fresh operating segment. As we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses and as we received initial indications of value, in the second quarter of 2019, we performed interim impairment assessments on the intangible and tangible assets within Campbell Fresh, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet, Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients, and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. As a result, we revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses.

Within Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients, we recorded impairment charges of $18 million on the trademark, and $159 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets.Within Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, we recorded impairment charges of $74 million on the trademark, and $31 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets. On Garden Fresh Gourmet, we recorded impairment charges of $23 million on the trademark and $39 million on customer relationships, which eliminated the carrying value of these assets, and $2 million on plant assets. There is no goodwill in Campbell Fresh. 

On February 25, 2019, we sold our U.S refrigerated soup business, and on April 25, 2019, we sold our Garden Fresh Gourmet business. On June 16, 2019, we sold Bolthouse Farms.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in Kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business. On July 12, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our Kelsen business. We sold the business on September 23, 2019.

As of July 28, 2019, Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations included $124 million of trademarks and $661 million of goodwill. 

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. 

Continuing Operations

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed an assessment on the assets within our European chips business and recorded an impairment charge of $16 million on intangible assets. This business is included in the Snacks segment and reporting unit. As a result of signing a definitive agreement to sell the European chips business on September 18, 2019, we expect to incur additional charges of approximately $65 million in the first quarter of 2020 as the carrying value of the disposal group will include allocated goodwill, as well as foreign currency translation adjustments.

As of July 28, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill related to continuing operations was $4.017 billion. Excluding potential charges related to the pending sale of the European chips business, holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 fair value measurement constant, a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital assumption would not reduce fair value of any of the reporting units below carrying value and would not result any impairment charges. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeds net book value by at least 60%.

As of July 28, 2019, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks related to continuing operations was $2.629 billion, of which $61 million related to the Plum trademark and $292 million related to the Pace trademark. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 Plum trademark fair value measurement constant, neither a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital nor a 1% reduction in revenue growth would result in a fair value below carrying value. The estimated fair value of the Pace trademark exceeded the carrying value by less than 10%. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2019 Pace trademark fair value measurement constant, a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would result in an impairment charge of approximately $20 million and a 1% reduction in revenue growth would result in a fair value equal to carrying value.

For our recent acquisitions, the carrying value of trademarks of $280 million associated with the Pacific Foods acquisition and $1.996 billion associated with the Snyder's-Lance acquisition approximates fair value as of July 28, 2019. Holding all other assumptions constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of the these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:

The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. 

If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential additional impairment charges could result. We will continue to monitor the valuation of our long-lived assets.

Pension and postretirement benefits — We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. 

The discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. Beginning in 2018, we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense (income). We elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations. We accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in accounting estimate. As a result of this change, net periodic benefit income increased by approximately $17 million in 2018, compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method.

The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. 

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense (income) was $103 million in 2019, ($185) million in 2018 and ($258) million in 2017. 

Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately $7 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately $107 million. A 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss.

No contributions were made to U.S. pension plans in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were $5 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We do not expect to contribute to the U.S. pension plans in 2020. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are not expected to be material in 2020.

See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits. 

Income taxes — The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. 

On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings.
