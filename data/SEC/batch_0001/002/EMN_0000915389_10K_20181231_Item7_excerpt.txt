ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based upon the consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted ("GAAP") in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"). All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Beginning January 1, 2018, Eastman's primary measure of operating performance for all periods presented is earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") on a consolidated and segment basis. Previously, the Company's primary measure of operating performance was operating earnings.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Eastman evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Definite-lived Assets

Properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by Eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review of properties and equipment is performed at the asset group level and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company's assumptions related to long-lived assets are subject to change and impairments may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings.

Goodwill

Eastman conducts testing of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the Company has determined to be its "components". Components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by Company operating segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. 

On October 1, 2018, management adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to simplify the annual goodwill impairment testing process. A reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company uses an income approach and applies a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit. Key assumptions and estimates used in the Company's 2018 goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues, expenses, and cash flows determined using the Company's annual multi-year strategic plan and a market participant tax rate. The most critical assumptions are the estimated discount rate and a projected long-term growth rate. The Company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. However, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the Company's estimates. In addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different determinations. In order to determine the discount rate, the Company uses a market participant weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") approach. The WACC is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. Therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the Company, may have an impact on future calculations of estimated fair value. For additional information, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As a result of the goodwill impairment testing performed during fourth quarter 2018, fair values were determined to substantially exceed the carrying values for each reporting unit tested with the exception of crop protection (part of the Additives & Functional Products operating segment as described in Part I, Item 1, "Business", of this Annual Report). The Company reduced the carrying value of the crop protection reporting unit to its estimated fair value through recognition of a $38 million goodwill impairment. The impairment was primarily driven by an increase in the WACC applied to the impairment analysis and the estimated impact of future regulatory changes. Two of the most critical assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of the crop protection reporting unit are the target market long-term growth rate and the WACC. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis of both of those assumptions, assuming a one percent decrease in the expected long-term growth rate or a one percent increase in the WACC, and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the crop protection reporting unit below carrying value. The crop protection reporting unit's goodwill after the reduction for impairment was $235 million as of December 31, 2018.

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. The Company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant WACC plus a risk premium. 

The Company had $539 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets at the time of impairment testing. There was no material impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the tests performed during fourth quarter 2018. 

The Company will continue to monitor both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any indication of triggering events which might require additional testing before the next annual impairment test.

For additional information, see Note 4, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Environmental Costs

Eastman accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum undiscounted amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $271 million to the maximum of $508 million and from the best estimate or minimum of $280 million to the maximum of $483 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts accrued at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

31

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. The Company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. These future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. If the Company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses charged to earnings will be impacted. For sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate for these asset retirement obligation costs accrued to date was $25 million and $24 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 

The Company's total amount reserved for environmental loss contingencies, including the remediation and closure and post-closure costs described above, was $296 million and $304 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. This loss contingency reserve represents the best estimate or minimum for undiscounted remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date for discounted asset retirement obligation costs. For additional information, see Note 12, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Under its other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S., Eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007. Eastman provides a subsidy for pre-Medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007 that will end on December 31, 2021. Company funding is also provided for eligible Medicare retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. The estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits primarily reflect the Company's assumptions related to discount rates and expected return on plan assets. For valuing the obligations and assets of the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the Company assumed weighted average discount rates of 4.29 percent and 2.35 percent, respectively, and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 7.43 percent and 4.49 percent, respectively at December 31, 2018. The Company assumed a weighted average discount rate of 4.26 percent for its other postretirement benefit plans and an expected return on plan assets of 3.75 percent for its voluntary employees' beneficiary association retiree trust at December 31, 2018. The estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.

The Company performed a five-year experience study of the assumptions for the U.S. plans in 2017 which included a review of the mortality tables. As a result of the experience study, the Company has updated the mortality assumptions used to a modified RP-2017 table with modified MP-2017 improvement scale and no collar adjustment. 

The projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 expense are affected by year-end 2018 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company's long-term assumptions in the assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to calculate the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are established each December 31. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Because future health care benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. The expected return on plan assets is based upon prior performance and the long-term expected returns in the markets in which the trusts invest their funds, primarily in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income, U.S. and non-U.S. public equity, private equity, and real estate. Moreover, the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption and on average is expected to approximate the actual return on plan assets. Actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances and could vary materially from assumptions. 

In 2016, the Company changed the approach used to calculate service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the mark-to-market ("MTM") actuarial gain or loss. The MTM gain or loss, as described in the next paragraph, is typically recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. For additional information, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The Company uses fair value accounting for plan assets. If actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, primarily discount rates and long-term assumptions for asset returns which were used in determining the current year expense, the difference is recognized as part of the MTM net gain or loss in fourth quarter each year, and any other quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The MTM net gain or loss applied to net earnings in 2018, 2017, and 2016 due to the actual experience versus actuarial assumptions for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans were a net loss of $99 million, a net gain of $21 million, and a net loss of $97 million, respectively. The 2018 MTM net loss included an actuarial gain of approximately $170 million, resulting primarily from the Company's December 31, 2018 weighted-average assumed discount rate of 3.82 percent, up from the prior year, and changes in other actuarial assumptions. Overall asset values decreased approximately $270 million due to asset values depreciating in excess of the assumed weighted-average rate of return. The actual loss was approximately $80 million, or an approximately 3 percent loss, which was below the expected return of approximately $190 million, or approximately 7 percent.

33

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

While changes in obligations do not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Litigation and Contingent Liabilities

From time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Based upon currently available facts, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be adversely affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. 

Income Taxes

Amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities on Eastman's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income and domestic and foreign taxes, using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning opportunities. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from management estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and statements of financial position. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, valuation allowances of $466 million and $410 million, respectively, have been provided against the deferred tax assets. The Company recognizes income tax positions that are more likely than not to be realized and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the balance sheet.

On December 22, 2017, the 2017 "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" ("Tax Reform Act") was enacted. Accounting for the impacts of newly enacted tax legislation are generally required to be completed in the period of enactment. Following enactment of the Tax Reform Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") provided guidance for initial accounting for the Tax Reform Act in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, "Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" ("SAB 118"). The period to finalize accounting for the Tax Reform Act is up to one year following the enactment date and SAB 118 allows companies to provide for the impact of the Tax Reform Act under three scenarios: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of the Tax Reform Act and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply accounting based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to tax reform being enacted. Because enactment of the Tax Reform Act was close to Eastman's year end, the Company was not able to complete the accounting for certain effects of the changes in tax law, but was able to reasonably estimate the effects and recognized those estimates as provisional amounts as of December 31, 2017. 

As of December 31, 2017, management estimated a $339 million net tax benefit, primarily resulting from the Tax Reform Act and a related tax loss from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center. In 2018, the Company recognized an adjustment to the 2017 net tax benefit which decreased earnings by $20 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Company considers the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Reform Act under SAB 118 to be complete. As of December 31, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury has issued a number of proposed regulations related to implementation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and certain states may issue clarifying guidance regarding state income tax conformity to the current federal tax code. Finalization of these regulations in 2019 or future periods may result in changes in the period of enactment to the amounts currently reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Any future changes in U.S. tax law may have a significant impact on the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. For further information, see Note 7, "Income Taxes", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures, and the accompanying reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, are presented below in this section and in "Overview", "Results of Operations", "Summary by Operating Segment", "Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Other Financial Information", and "Outlook" in this MD&A.

Management discloses non-GAAP financial measures, and the related reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the Company's and its operating segments' performances, make resource allocation decisions, and evaluate organizational and individual performances in determining certain performance-based compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP, and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non-GAAP financial measure, but to consider such measures alongside the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-Core Items and any Unusual or Non-Recurring Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Earnings

In addition to evaluating Eastman's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows as reported in accordance with GAAP, management also evaluates Company and operating segment performance, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions, excluding the effect of transactions, costs, and losses or gains that do not directly result from Eastman's normal, or "core", business and operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. 

•Non-core transactions, costs, and losses or gains relate to, among other things, cost reductions, growth and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of core business operations, and have included asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, costs of and related to acquisitions, gains and losses from and costs related to dispositions of businesses, financing transaction costs, and MTM losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 

•In 2018 the Company recognized unusual income from insurance in excess of costs for, and in 2017 recognized unusual net costs of, the disruption, repairs, and reconstruction of the Kingsport site's coal gasification operations area resulting from the previously reported October 4, 2017 explosion (the "coal gasification incident"). Management considers the coal gasification incident unusual because of the Company's operational and safety history and the magnitude of the unplanned disruption.

•In 2018 the Company recognized unusual costs and an unusual net decrease to earnings from adjustments of the provisional net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017, resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the transition to an international treasury services center. Management considers these actions and associated costs and income unusual because of the infrequent nature of such changes in tax law and resulting actions and the significant impacts on earnings.

Because non-core, unusual, or non-recurring transactions, costs, and losses or gains may materially affect the Company's, or any particular operating segment's, financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized, Eastman believes it is appropriate to evaluate both the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with GAAP and the related non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effect on the Company's results of these non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. In addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management evaluates such non-GAAP measures, and believes that investors may also evaluate such measures, because such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's, and its segments', operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and, as a result, provide a better indication of expected future trends.

35

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Adjusted Tax Rate and Provision for Income Taxes

In interim periods, Eastman discloses non-GAAP earnings with an adjusted effective tax rate and a resulting adjusted provision for income taxes using the Company's forecasted tax rate for the full year as of the end of the interim period. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes are equal to the Company's projected full year effective tax rate and provision for income taxes on earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items for completed periods. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes may fluctuate during the year for changes in events and circumstances that change the Company's forecasted annual effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Management discloses this adjusted effective tax rate, and the related reconciliation to the GAAP effective tax rate, to provide investors more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's operational performance on a period-over-period interim basis and on the same basis as management evaluates quarterly financial results to provide a better indication of expected full year results. 

Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure

Eastman regularly evaluates and discloses to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow", which management defines as cash provided by operating activities, less the amount of net capital expenditures (typically the GAAP measure additions to properties and equipment, and in 2018, net of proceeds from property insurance). Such net capital expenditures are generally funded from available cash and, as such, management believes they should be considered in determining free cash flow. Management believes this is an appropriate metric to assess the Company's ability to fund priorities for uses of available cash. The priorities for cash after funding operations include payment of quarterly dividends, repayment of debt, funding targeted growth opportunities, and repurchasing shares. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in order to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating financial performance and potential future cash available for various initiatives and assessing organizational performance in determining certain performance-based compensation and because management believes investors and securities analysts often use a similar measure of free cash flow to compare the results, and value, of comparable companies. In addition, Eastman may disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow yield", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by the Company's market capitalization. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in comparing cash flow generation with that of peer and other companies.

Non-GAAP Measures in this Annual Report

The following non-core items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report:

•MTM pension and other postretirement benefit plans gains and losses resulting from the changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets during the period;

•Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net, of which asset impairments are non-cash transactions impacting profitability;

•Acquisition integration and transaction costs; 

•Early debt extinguishment and other related costs resulting from repayment of borrowings;

•Cost of disposition of claims against operations that were discontinued by Solutia, Inc. ("Solutia") prior to the Company's acquisition of Solutia in 2012;

•Gain from sale of the formulated electronics cleaning solutions business, which was part of the Additives & Functional Products segment;

•Gain from sale of the Company's 50 percent interest in the Primester cellulose acetate flake joint venture; and

•Tax benefit associated with a previously impaired site.

36

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following unusual items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report:

•Costs of, and income from insurance for, the coal gasification incident;

•Costs of currency transaction and professional fees resulting from fourth quarter 2017 tax law changes and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations; and

•Estimated net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and tax impact of related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations and related subsequent adjustments recognized in 2018.

As described above, the alternative non-GAAP measure of cash flow "free cash flow" is presented in this Annual Report.

•Asset impairments and restructuring charges, net,

•Other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net,

•Other (income) charges, net,

•EBIT,

•Early debt extinguishment and other related costs

•Provision for (benefit from) income taxes,

•Net earnings attributable to Eastman,

•Diluted EPS, and

•Net cash provided by operating activities.

Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Alternative Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure

In addition to the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report and other periodic reports, management occasionally has evaluated and disclosed to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP measure cash provided by operating activities excluding certain non-core, unusual, or non-recurring sources or uses of cash or including cash from or used by activities that are managed as part of core business operations ("adjusted cash provided by operating activities") when analyzing, among other things, business performance, liquidity and financial position, and performance-based compensation. Management has used this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the GAAP measure cash provided by operating activities because it believes it is a more appropriate metric to evaluate the cash flows from Eastman's core operations that are available for organic and inorganic growth initiatives and because it allows for a more consistent period-over-period presentation of such amounts. In its evaluation, management generally excludes the impact of certain non-core activities and decisions of management because such activities and decisions are not considered core, ongoing components of operations and the decisions to undertake or not to undertake such activities may be made irrespective of the cash generated from operations, and generally includes cash from or used in activities that are managed as operating activities and in business operating decisions. Management has disclosed this non-GAAP measure and the related reconciliation to investors and securities analysts to allow them to better understand and evaluate the information used by management in its decision-making processes and because management believes investors and securities analysts use similar measures to assess Company performance, liquidity, and financial position over multiple periods and to compare these with other companies.

38

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Alternative Non-GAAP Earnings Measures

From time to time, Eastman may also disclose to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP earnings measures "EBIT Margin", "Adjusted EBITDA", "EBITDA Margin", and "Return on Invested Capital" (or "ROIC"). Management defines EBIT Margin as the GAAP measure EBIT adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's income statement for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA (net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's income statement for the same periods. Management defines ROIC as net earnings plus interest expense after tax divided by average total borrowings plus average stockholders' equity for the periods presented, each derived from the GAAP measures in the Company's financial statements for the periods presented. Management believes that EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and ROIC are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of and returns from Eastman's operating businesses, and, from time to time, uses such measures in internal performance calculations. Further, management understands that investors and securities analysts often use similar measures of EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and ROIC to compare the results, returns, and value of the Company with those of peer and other companies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. Eastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development ("R&D") and advantaged global market access. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-user products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, rubber additive formulations, adhesives formulations, nonwovens and textiles, and animal nutrition. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends such as health and wellness, natural resource efficiency, an increasing middle class in emerging economies, and feeding a growing population. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, will result in consistent, sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow.

The Company generated sales revenue of $10.2 billion and $9.5 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales revenue increased $602 million in 2018 as a result of increases in all operating segments. EBIT was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the non-core and unusual items referenced in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures", adjusted EBIT was $1.6 billion in both 2018 and 2017. Further discussion of sales revenue and EBIT changes is presented in "Results of Operations" and "Summary by Operating Segment" in this MD&A.

Net earnings and EPS attributable to Eastman and adjusted net earnings and EPS attributable to Eastman were as follows:

(2) Provision for income taxes for non-core and unusual items are calculated using the tax rate for the jurisdiction where the gains are taxable and the expenses are deductible.

The Company generated $1.54 billion of cash from operating activities in 2018 compared to $1.66 billion of cash generated from operating activities during 2017. Free cash flow was $1.08 billion in 2018 and $1.01 billion in 2017.

As previously reported, in fourth quarter 2017 an explosion in the Kingsport site's coal gasification area disrupted manufacturing operations, primarily for the Fibers and CI segments which are significant internal users of cellulose and acetyl stream intermediates. The incident, net of insurance, reduced 2017 earnings by $112 million and increased 2018 earnings by $83 million. The cumulative net costs of the incident were $29 million. Costs net of insurance of the disruption, repairs, and reconstruction of coal gasification operations in 2017 were recognized in "Cost of sales" and insurance net of costs in 2018 was recognized in "Cost of sales" and "Other (income) charges, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Eastman's results of operations as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report are summarized and analyzed below. 

Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased as a result of increases in all operating segments.

2017 Compared to 2016

Sales revenue increased as increases in the AFP, CI, and AM segments more than offset a decline in the Fibers

segment.

Gross Profit

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Gross profit included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018 and coal gasification incident net costs in 2017. Excluding these unusual items, gross profit decreased primarily due to raw material, energy, and distribution costs exceeding selling prices across most segments and higher growth initiative costs being partially offset by higher sales volume in the AM and AFP segments.

2017 Compared to 2016

Gross profit in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident. Excluding this unusual item, gross profit increased as increases in the CI, AFP, and AM segments more than offset a decrease in the Fibers segment. Gross profit in 2017 was increased by lower labor and manufacturing costs from corporate cost reduction actions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

SG&A expenses in 2018 included $7 million of costs of professional fees resulting from fourth quarter 2017 tax law changes and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the transition to an international treasury services center. Excluding this unusual item, SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to lower variable compensation costs mostly offset by higher costs of growth initiatives.

2017 Compared to 2016

SG&A expenses in 2016 included transaction costs for final resolution of the 2011 Sterling Chemicals, Inc. acquisition purchase price and integration costs for the Commonwealth business acquired in December 2014. Excluding these non-core items, SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher performance-based variable compensation costs and strategic initiative expenditures partially offset by cost reductions resulting from corporate actions taken in 2016.

Research and Development Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

R&D expenses increased primarily due to higher costs of growth initiatives.

2017 Compared to 2016

R&D expenses were slightly higher in 2017. The Company shifted R&D expenses by eliminating multiple programs and reallocating resources among the Company's operating segments. R&D investments were refocused to where disruptive macro trends create unmet needs in attractive niche markets where the Company's core technologies can deliver material solutions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2018, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net consisted of restructuring charges of approximately $6 million for severance. As a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill the Company reduced the carrying value of the crop protection reporting unit (part of the AFP operating segment) to its estimated fair value through recognition of a $38 million goodwill impairment. The impairment was primarily driven by an increase in the WACC applied to the impairment analysis and the estimated impact of future regulatory changes. Additionally, the Company recognized an intangible asset impairment of $1 million in the AM segment.

In 2017, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net were $3 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges, including severance, in the AFP segment related to the closure of a facility in China and restructuring charges of approximately $5 million for severance. 

In 2016, the Company impaired a capital project in the AFP segment that resulted in a charge of $12 million and recognized a gain of $2 million in the AFP segment for the sale of previously impaired assets at the Crystex™ insoluble sulfur R&D site in France. The Company recognized restructuring charges of $35 million, including severance, related to an announced plan to reduce costs primarily in 2017. Management anticipated and realized total cost savings of approximately $50 million mostly in 2017 primarily in SG&A expenses and cost of sales.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Interest Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Net interest expense decreased $6 million primarily as a result of U.S. dollar to euro cross-currency swaps and reduced debt partly offset by increased interest rates.

2017 Compared to 2016

Net interest expense decreased $14 million primarily as a result of prior year refinancing of certain outstanding public debt and repayment of term loan borrowings in 2017.

Early Debt Extinguishment and Other Related Costs

In fourth quarter 2018, the Company sold 3.5% notes due December 2021 in the principal amount of $300 million and 4.5% notes due December 2028 in the principal amount of $500 million. Net proceeds from the notes were $789 million and were used, together with available cash, for the early and full repayment of the 5.5% notes due November 2019 ($250 million principal) and the partial redemption of the 2.7% notes due January 2020 ($550 million principal). Total consideration for these redemptions were $806 million ($800 million total principal and $6 million for the early redemption premiums) and are reported as financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The early repayment resulted in a charge of $7 million for early debt extinguishment costs which were primarily attributable to the early redemption premiums and related unamortized costs. The book value of the redeemed debt was $799 million. For additional information regarding the early debt extinguishment costs, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

In fourth quarter 2016, the Company sold additional euro-denominated 1.50% notes due May 2023 in the principal amount of €200 million ($213 million) and euro-denominated 1.875% notes due November 2026 in the principal amount of €500 million ($534 million). In December 2016, the Company borrowed $300 million under a second five-year term loan agreement ("2021 Term Loan"). Proceeds from the notes and 2021 Term Loan borrowings were used for the early repayment of the 2.4% notes due June 2017 ($500 million principal) and 6.30% notes due November 2018 ($160 million principal) and partial redemptions of the 4.5% notes due January 2021 ($65 million principal), 3.6% notes due August 2022 ($150 million principal), 7 1/4% debentures due January 2024 ($47 million principal), 7 5/8% debentures due June 2024 ($11 million principal), 3.8% notes due March 2025 ($100 million principal), and 7.60% debentures due February 2027 ($28 million principal). The early repayments resulted in a charge of $76 million for early debt extinguishment costs and related derivatives and hedging items.

In second quarter 2016, the Company sold euro-denominated 1.50% notes due 2023 in the principal amount of €550 million ($614 million). Proceeds from the sale of the notes, net of transaction costs, were used for the early repayment of $500 million of 2.4% notes due June 2017 and repayment of other borrowings. The early repayment resulted in a charge of $9 million for early debt extinguishment costs primarily attributable to the early redemption premium and related unamortized costs.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Provision for income taxes for non-core and unusual items is calculated using the tax rate for the jurisdiction where the gains are taxable and the expenses are deductible.

The 2018 effective tax rate includes a $20 million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the provisional net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act. These adjustments related to the one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income and changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.

The 2017 effective tax rate included a $339 million net benefit resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and a tax loss from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center, a $20 million benefit due to amendments to prior years’ domestic income tax returns, and a $30 million benefit reflecting the finalization of prior years' foreign income tax returns. The 2017 effective tax rate also includes an $8 million tax benefit due to a tax ruling permitting deductibility of a liquidation loss on a previously impaired site. 

The 2016 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $16 million related to foreign tax credits as a result of the amendment of prior year income tax returns, a $16 million one-time benefit for the restoration of tax basis for which depreciation deductions were previously limited, and a $9 million tax benefit primarily due to adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of 2014 foreign income tax returns.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT

Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. For additional financial and product information for each operating segment, see "Business - Business Segments" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 19, "Segment Information", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. For quarterly operating segment information, see Exhibit 99.03 "Quarterly Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes Reconciliations" of this Annual Report.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices across most product lines, and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The higher sales volume was primarily attributed to volume growth in care chemicals, coatings and inks additives, tire additives, and animal nutrition, and products previously reported in the CI operating segment.

EBIT in 2018 included a goodwill impairment charge related to the crop protection reporting unit and coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs. EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident, asset impairment and restructuring charges, including severance, related to the closure of a facility in China, and a gain from sale of the formulated electronics cleaning solutions business. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume of $54 million largely offset by higher raw material, energy, and distribution costs more than exceeding higher selling prices by $20 million, primarily due to fourth quarter competitive pressure in adhesives resins, and higher growth initiative costs of approximately $20 million.

2017 Compared to 2016

Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume across the segment, including for specialty fluids due to the timing of customer solar energy project completions, animal nutrition products, and tire additives products.

48

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident, asset impairment and restructuring charges, including severance, related to the closure of a facility in China, and a gain from sale of the formulated electronics cleaning solutions business. EBIT in 2016 included asset impairment and restructuring charges, net consisting of impairment of a capital project resulting in a charge of $12 million partially offset by a $2 million gain for the sale of previously impaired assets at the Crystex™ insoluble sulfur R&D site in France. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume of $97 million partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs, including the reduced negative impact of hedges of commodity prices on raw material costs, exceeding higher selling prices by $60 million.

Growth Initiatives

In 2018, the AFP segment:

•advanced growth and innovation of Crystex™ insoluble sulfur rubber additives through mechanical completion of an expansion of the manufacturing facility in Kuantan, Malaysia in second quarter 2018 resulting in commercial sales beginning in first quarter 2019. This expansion is expected to allow the Company to capitalize on recent enhancements of technology by improving the Company's cost position and facilitating the introduction of new products into the tire markets; and 

•advanced growth of specialty ketones for low volatile organic compound ("VOC") coatings and other markets as a result of a capacity expansion at the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing facility which became fully operational in second quarter 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix across the segment, including for premium products such as performance films, Saflex™ head-up displays, and Tritan™ copolyester. While 2018 had higher sales volume compared with 2017, fourth quarter 2018 had lower specialty plastics sales volume compared to fourth quarter 2017 attributed to customer inventory destocking related to uncertainty caused by the U.S. - China trade dispute.

EBIT in 2018 included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs and a charge for an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products of $94 million, partially offset by higher raw material (particularly for paraxylene in the second half of the year), energy, and distribution costs of $67 million and higher growth initiative costs of approximately $25 million.

49

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2017 Compared to 2016

Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume across the segment, including of premium products such as automotive performance films, Tritan™ copolyester, and Saflex™ acoustic interlayers.

EBIT in 2017 included coal gasification incident net costs. Excluding this unusual item, EBIT increased primarily due to the combined impact of higher sales volume, lower unit costs due to higher capacity utilization, and improved product mix of premium products of $83 million. The increase was partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $48 million and increased costs of growth initiatives.

Growth Initiatives

In 2018, the AM segment:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•advanced growth and innovation of Saflex™ acoustic interlayers used in the transportation and building and construction markets, enabled by construction of a manufacturing facility for polyvinyl butyral ("PVB") resin at the Kuantan, Malaysia manufacturing facility which became fully operational in first quarter 2018; 

•advanced growth in the Chinese market supported by the conversion of manufacturing capacity at the Suzhou, China site from non-acoustic to acoustic interlayer production which was mechanically completed in fourth quarter 2018 and is expected to produce material qualified for commercial sales in 2019; and

•strengthened growth in automotive window and paint protection films in North America and China through improved sales channel, marketing, and commercial execution strategies and capabilities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices across most product lines, particularly for acetyl derivatives attributed to favorable market conditions and for olefin derivatives due to higher raw material and energy costs. Higher selling prices were partially offset by lower sales volume primarily attributable to lower merchant ethylene sales, products previously reported in the CI segment being reported in the AFP segment in 2018, and supplier operational disruptions at the Texas City and Longview, Texas manufacturing facilities. Lower merchant ethylene sales are primarily due to the decision to reduce operating rates of the olefins cracking units at the Longview, Texas manufacturing facility due to spot ethylene prices. Lower sales volume was partially offset by higher functional amines products sales attributed to strengthened agriculture and energy markets.

EBIT included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018 and coal gasification incident net costs in 2017. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume of $62 million, and higher planned manufacturing shutdown costs of $21 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher selling prices exceeding higher raw material, energy, and distribution costs of $61 million.

2017 Compared to 2016

Sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices attributed to higher raw material prices and improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by lower intermediates sales volume due to the coal gasification incident.

EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident. Excluding this unusual item, EBIT increased primarily due to the reduced negative impact of hedges of commodity prices on raw material costs, primarily for propane, of $100 million, lower scheduled maintenance costs of $24 million, and lower operating costs of $21 million. The increase was partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs more than offsetting higher selling prices by $27 million.

Cost and Growth Initiatives

The Company reduced operating rates of the olefin cracking units at the Longview, Texas manufacturing facility to reduce the amount of excess ethylene produced and sold at lower spot prices in the merchant ethylene market over the second half of 2018. The Company took further action through completion of modifications to the site's olefin cracking units, which will allow for the introduction of refinery-grade propylene ("RGP") into the feedstock mix while also reducing the amount of other purchased feedstocks in 2019. This feedstock shift is expected to result in a significant decrease in ethylene production and excess ethylene sales, while maintaining historical levels of propylene production. Consequently, the RGP project provides the flexibility to largely remove the Company from participation in the merchant ethylene market, while retaining a cost-advantaged integrated propylene position to support specialty derivatives throughout the Company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased primarily due to sales of nonwovens products previously reported in "Other" of $57 million and higher sales volume, particularly for textiles products. The higher sales revenue was partially offset by lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow selling prices were primarily attributed to lower industry capacity utilization.

EBIT included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018 and coal gasification incident net costs in 2017. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to the net impact of $7 million of lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow attributed to lower capacity utilization, and higher raw material and energy costs, partially offset by volume growth of textiles products.

2017 Compared to 2016

Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume, particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow selling prices were primarily attributed to lower industry capacity utilization rates. Lower acetate tow sales volume was primarily attributed to reduced sales in China.

EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident and EBIT in 2016 included a gain from the sale of the Company's interest in the cellulose acetate manufacturing joint venture. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to approximately $103 million of lower selling prices and lower sales volume, partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from changes in segment business operations and assets.

Cost and Growth Initiatives

As a result of challenging market conditions for acetate tow, the Company closed its Workington, UK acetate tow manufacturing facility in 2015. Following an increase in acetate flake capacity at the Kingsport, Tennessee site in 2015, the Fibers segment could supply all its acetate tow and yarn spinning capacity from this low-cost flake asset. In order to fully utilize the increased capacity and reduce fixed costs, in June 2016, the Company sold its 50 percent interest in Primester, which manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee site. In 2018, the Company repurposed some of its acetate tow manufacturing capacity for production of new products.

52

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Fibers segment R&D efforts focus on serving existing customers, leveraging proprietary cellulose ester and spinning technology for differentiated application development in new markets, optimizing asset productivity, and working with suppliers to reduce costs. For acetate tow, these efforts are assisting customers in the effective use of the segment's products and customers' product development efforts. Beyond acetate tow, management is applying the innovation-driven growth model to leverage its fibers technology and expertise to focus on innovative growth in the textiles and nonwovens markets. Examples of recent product innovation within the Fibers segment include Naia™, a yarn for the apparel market developed from Eastman's proprietary cellulose ester technology, Avra™, a family of performance fibers for the apparel, home furnishings and industrial fabrics markets developed from a combination of Eastman proprietary spinning technology and polymer chemistry enabling unique fiber capabilities of size, shape, comfort, and performance, and Vestera™, a new wood pulp-based alternative for the nonwoven industry used in personal hygiene applications.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Cash Flows

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 Compared to 2017

Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to increased inventory resulting from reduced demand and higher cost raw materials inventory in fourth quarter 2018.

Cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to decreased capital expenditures as significant capital projects related to key growth initiatives achieved mechanical completion and were put into service during 2018. See "Capital Expenditures" below.

Cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to increased share repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by reduced debt repayments.

2017 Compared to 2016

Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher earnings and lower pension and other postretirement contributions due to the advanced funding of U.S. defined pension plans in 2016. 

Cash used in investing activities in 2017 and 2016 was primarily for capital expenditures. 

Cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to increases in both share repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by less net debt repayments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had cash and cash equivalents as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Risk Factors" in this MD&A. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategic and financial flexibility.

The Company has access to a $1.50 billion revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") that was amended in October 2018 to increase the available borrowing amount from $1.25 billion and extend the maturity to October 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes and supports commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, commercial paper borrowings were $130 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.91 percent. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The Company has access to a $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "A/R Facility") that expires April 2020. Eastman Chemical Financial Corporation ("ECFC"), a subsidiary of the Company, has an agreement to sell interests in trade receivables under the A/R Facility to a third party purchaser. Third party creditors of ECFC have first priority claims on the assets of ECFC before those assets would be available to satisfy the Company's general obligations. Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender's borrowing costs, and ECFC pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility. At December 31, 2018, the Company's borrowings under the A/R Facility were $50 million supported by trade receivables with an interest rate of 3.39 percent. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The Company has access to borrowings of up to €150 million ($172 million) under a receivables facility based on the discounted value of selected customer accounts receivable. This facility expires December 2020 and renews for another one year period if not terminated with 90 days notice by either party. These arrangements include receivables in the United States, Belgium, and Finland, and are subject to various eligibility requirements. Borrowings under this facility are subject to interest at an agreed spread above LIBOR and EURIBOR plus administration and insurance fees. The amount of outstanding borrowings under this facility were $112 million at December 31, 2018 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.70 percent. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The Credit and A/R Facilities and other borrowing agreements contain customary covenants and events of default, some of which require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios that determine the amounts available and terms of borrowings. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The amount of

available borrowings under the A/R and Credit Facilities was approximately $1.70 billion as of December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Section 5.03 of the Credit Facility at Exhibit 10.02 to the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Debt and Other Commitments

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2018, Eastman's borrowings totaled approximately $6.2 billion with various maturities. In fourth quarter 2018 the Company refinanced certain outstanding public debt with proceeds of the sale of new debt securities, which extended the weighted average maturity of outstanding debt while retaining adequate levels of pre-payable debt and near-term maturities. Estimated future payments of debt securities assumes the repayment of principal upon stated maturity, and actual amounts and the timing of such payments may differ materially due to repayment or other changes in the terms of such debt prior to maturity. For information on debt securities, credit facilities and other, and interest payable, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

For information about purchase obligations and operating leases, see Note 11, "Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

Amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental loss contingency reserves, accrued compensation benefits, uncertain tax liabilities, one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income under the Tax Reform Act, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2024 and beyond" line item.

The amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the Pension Protection Act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. The Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. See Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. 

The resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for the Company's accounting policy for environmental costs, and see Note 12, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has off balance sheet uncommitted non-recourse factoring facilities that include customer specific receivables in the United States and Europe. The Company sells the receivables at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized. There is no continuing involvement with these receivables once sold and no credit loss exposure. The total amount of receivables sold during 2018 and 2017 were $169 million and $35 million, respectively.

In October 2018, Eastman added an uncommitted non-recourse factoring facility under which the Company sells undivided interests in certain receivables and provides servicing at market rates with no credit loss exposure. The Company sells the receivables at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized. The total amount of receivables sold during 2018 was $50 million.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $528 million ($463 million net of proceeds from property damage insurance for 2017 coal gasification incident), $649 million, and $626 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2018 were primarily for the following projects:

•Crystex™ manufacturing capacity expansion in Kuantan, Malaysia;

•Tritan™ copolyester manufacturing capacity expansion in Kingsport, Tennessee;

•conversion of manufacturing capacity from non-acoustic to acoustic interlayer production in Suzhou, China; 

•modification of olefin cracking units in Longview, Texas; and

•manufacturing capacity debottlenecking and site modernization projects in Kingsport, Tennessee.

The Company expects that 2019 capital spending will be between $475 million and $500 million, primarily for targeted growth initiatives and maintenance.

The Company had capital expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement of approximately $44 million, $38 million, and $45 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Stock Repurchases and Dividends

In February 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $1 billion repurchase authorization in May 2018, acquiring a total of 12,215,950 shares. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interests of the Company. As of December 31, 2018, a total of 2,470,755 shares have been repurchased under the February 2018 authorization for a total amount of $248 million. During 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 3,959,878 shares for a total cost of approximately $400 million.

The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.62 per share during the first quarter of 2019, payable on April 5, 2019 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2019.

Other

Eastman did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, the Company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to any such relationships.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INFLATION

In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastman's costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although derivative financial instruments are utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. Management expects the volatility of raw material and energy prices and costs to continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects. For additional information see Note 9, "Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

For information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to Eastman's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

OUTLOOK

In 2019, management expects adjusted EPS to be six to ten percent higher than 2018 and greater than $1.1 billion free cash flow. These expectations assume:

•earnings to benefit from a robust portfolio of specialty businesses in attractive niche end-markets, strong growth in high margin, innovative products, and relatively unchanged manufacturing costs due to aggressive cost management;

•earnings to be negatively impacted by slow global economic growth, the U.S. - China trade dispute, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher pension costs due to lower expected return on assets and higher interest costs;

•interest expense of approximately $225 million;

•the full-year effective tax rate on reported earnings before income tax to be approximately 16 to 17 percent;

•depreciation and amortization of approximately $620 million;

•capital expenditures between $475 million and $500 million; 

•reduction in debt to be lower than 2018; and

•increased share repurchases compared to 2018.

The Company's 2019 financial results forecasts do not include non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile projected full-year 2019 earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items to projected reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts.

See "Risk Factors" below.

RISK FACTORS 

In addition to factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the most significant known factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time. See "Forward-Looking Statements".

Continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company.

The Company's business and operating results were affected by the impact of the last global recession, and its related impacts, such as the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that affected the global economy. Current uncertainty in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect Eastman's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect the Company's financial results.

Eastman is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures do not eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations and may limit the Company from fully benefiting from lower raw material costs and, conversely, offset the impact of higher raw material costs. In addition, natural disasters, plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities.

Loss or financial weakness of any of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial results.

Although Eastman has an extensive customer base, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced. No assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.

The Company's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing businesses, including cyber security risks, any of which could disrupt manufacturing operations or related infrastructure and adversely affect results of operations.

As a global specialty chemicals manufacturing company, Eastman's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. Significant limitation on the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, credit ratings, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as computer or equipment malfunction at third-party service providers, natural disasters, pandemic illness, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. The Company has in the past experienced cyber attacks and breaches of its computer information systems, although none of these have had a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. While the Company remains committed to managing cyber related risk, no assurances can be provided that any future disruptions due to these, or other, circumstances will not have a material effect on operations. Unplanned disruptions of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors, and the environment, and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. As previously reported, manufacturing operations and earnings have been negatively impacted by the fourth quarter 2017 operational incident in the Kingsport manufacturing facility coal gasification operations area and the second quarter 2018 third-party supplier operational disruptions at the Texas City and Longview, Texas manufacturing facilities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require significant resources in addition to or different from those available or in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives.

Eastman continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic and inorganic initiatives. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. Such initiatives are necessarily constrained by available and development of additional resources, including development, attraction, and retention of employee leadership, application development, and sales and marketing talent and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects.

The Company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in other countries, including U.S. and non-U.S. trade relations, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

More than half of Eastman's sales for 2018 were to customers outside of North America. The Company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales. Also, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, the Company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. or foreign countries have imposed and may impose additional taxes or otherwise tax Eastman's foreign income, or adopt or increase restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, tariffs or other taxes, or limitations on imports or exports (including recent and proposed changes in U.S. trade policy and resulting retaliatory actions by other countries, including China, which have recently reduced and which may increasingly reduce demand for and increase costs of impacted products or result in U.S.-based trade counterparties limiting trade with U.S.-based companies or non-U.S. customers limiting their purchases from U.S.-based companies). Certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Eastman's global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems, and the laws of some countries may not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Eastman's intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in loss of valuable proprietary information. There is also risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Eastman operates. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Eastman operates are a risk to the Company's financial performance. As Eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Eastman's business, financial condition, or results of operations.

61

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Company's future compliance costs.

Eastman and its facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. For example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Specifically, future changes in U.S. Federal legislation and regulation may increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs.

Significant acquisitions expose the Company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.

While acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of Eastman's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies (such as the previous acquisitions of Taminco Corporation and Solutia) subject the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These include, but are not limited to, the possibilities that the financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the Company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the Company's existing businesses; and that the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into Eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.

In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects.
