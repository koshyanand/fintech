ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity prices. Exelon’s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities.

Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)

Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy Exelon generates and purchases differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon is exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices. Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel and other commodities.

Generation

Electricity available from Generation’s owned or contracted generation supply in excess of Generation’s obligations to customers, including portions of the Utility Registrants' retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations, Generation enters into non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation uses derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during 2019 through 2021.

In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation’s owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Exelon's hedging program involves the hedging of commodity price risk for Exelon's expected generation, typically on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2018, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and ERCOT reportable segments is 89%-92%, 56%-59% and 32%-35% for 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generating facilities based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including Generation’s sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.

A portion of Generation’s hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for Generation’s entire economic hedge portfolio associated with a $5 reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on December 31, 2018 market conditions and hedged position would be decreases in pre-tax net income of approximately $57 million, $383 million and $618 million, respectively, for 2019, 2020 and 2021. Power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation actively manages its portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for its unhedged position. Actual 

163
results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes in Generation’s portfolio. See Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Proprietary Trading Activities

Proprietary trading portfolio activity for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted in pre-tax gains of $42 million due to net mark-to-market gains of $17 million and realized gains of $25 million. Generation has not segregated proprietary trading activity within the following discussion because of the relative size of the proprietary trading portfolio in comparison to Generation’s total Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. See Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Fuel Procurement

Generation procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation’s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 62% of Generation’s uranium concentrate requirements from 2019 through 2023 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements.

ComEd

ComEd entered into 20-year contracts for renewable energy and RECs beginning in June 2012. ComEd is permitted to recover its renewable energy and REC costs from retail customers with no mark-up. The annual commitments represent the maximum settlements with suppliers for renewable energy and RECs under the existing contract terms. Pursuant to the ICC’s Order on December 19, 2012, ComEd’s commitments under the existing long-term contracts were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. In addition, the ICC’s December 18, 2013 Order approved the reduction of ComEd’s commitments under those contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, and the amount of the reduction was approved by the ICC in March 2014.

ComEd has block energy contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process, which is further discussed in Note 4 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The block energy contracts are considered derivatives and qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. ComEd does not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE

PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process, which are further discussed in Note 4 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have certain full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives and qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Other full requirements contracts are not derivatives.

PECO, BGE and DPL have also executed derivative natural gas contracts, which either qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging programs for natural gas procurement have no direct impact on their financial statements.

164
PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Utility Registrants

Credit risk for the Utility Registrants is governed by credit and collection policies, which are aligned with state regulatory requirements. The Utility Registrants are currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within their franchised territories. The Utility Registrants record a provision for uncollectible accounts, based upon historical experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. The Utility Registrants will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. The Utility Registrants did not have any customers representing over 10% of their revenues as of December 31, 2018. See Note 4 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

As of December 31, 2018, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE's net credit exposure to suppliers was immaterial. See Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Collateral (All Registrants)

Generation

As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas and other commodities. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation’s net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. See Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding collateral requirements. See Note 22 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.

Generation transacts output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these 

168
payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with Generation. To post collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See ITEM 7. Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Matters — Exelon Credit Facilities for additional information.

The Utility Registrants

As of December 31, 2018, ComEd held $38 million in collateral from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts, approximately $31 million in collateral from suppliers for REC contract obligations and approximately $19 million in collateral from suppliers for long-term renewable energy contracts. BGE is not required to post collateral under its electric supply contracts but was holding an immaterial amount of collateral under its electric supply procurement contracts. BGE was not required to post collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts, but was holding an immaterial amount of collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts. Pepco and DPL were not required to post collateral under their energy and/or natural gas procurement contracts, but were holding an immaterial amount of collateral under their respective electric supply procurement contracts. PECO and ACE were not required to post collateral under their energy and/or natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 4 — Regulatory Matters and Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

RTOs and ISOs (All Registrants)

All Registrants participate in all, or some, of the established, wholesale spot energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, ISO-NY, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, OIESO and ERCOT. ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot energy markets that are administered by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot energy market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot energy market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants’ financial statements.

Exchange Traded Transactions (Exelon, Generation, PHI and DPL)

Generation enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX and the Nodal exchange ("the Exchanges"). DPL enters into commodity transactions on ICE. The Exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the Exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on Exchanges are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (All Registrants)

The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants may also utilize interest rate swaps to manage their interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2018, Exelon had $800 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and Exelon and Generation had $622 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges outstanding. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in approximately a $6 million decrease in Exelon Consolidated pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2018. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. See Note 12—Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

169
Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)

Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning its nuclear plants. As of December 31, 2018, Generation’s NDT funds are reflected at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation’s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a $529 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information of equity price risk as a result of the current capital and credit market conditions.
