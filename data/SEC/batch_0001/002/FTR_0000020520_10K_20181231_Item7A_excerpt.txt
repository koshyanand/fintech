Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

 ﻿  

 We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension plan assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures from interest rate risk and equity price risk are as follows:  

 ﻿  

 Interest Rate Exposure  

 ﻿  

 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest-bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and the related actuarial liability for pension obligations, as well as our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, 79% of our total debt had fixed interest rates. We had no interest rate swap agreements in effect at December 31, 2018. We believe that our currently outstanding obligation exposure to interest rate changes is minimal.  

 ﻿  

 Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, 21% of our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2018 have floating interest rates. The annual impact of 100 basis points change in the LIBOR would result in approximately $34 million of additional interest expense. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure, a near-term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

 ﻿  

 At December 31, 2018, the fair value of our long-term debt was estimated to be approximately $11.9 billion, based on quoted market prices, our overall weighted average borrowing rate was 8.59% and our overall weighted average maturity was approximately seven years. As of December 31, 2018, there has been no significant change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since December 31, 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Equity Price Exposure  

 ﻿  

 Our exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of December 31, 2018 is primarily limited to our pension plan assets. We have no other security investments of any significant amount.  

 ﻿  

 Our Pension Plan assets decreased from $2,674 million at December 31, 2017 to $2,348 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $326 million, or 12%. This decrease was a result of benefit payments of $317 million and negative investment returns of $159 million, including investment management and administrative fees. The decrease was partially offset by contributions to the Plan of $150 million.
