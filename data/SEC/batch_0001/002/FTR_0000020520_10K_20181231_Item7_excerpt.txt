Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

  Introduction  

 ﻿  

 Overview  

 ﻿  

 Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) is a provider of communications services in the United States, with approximately 4.5 million customers, 3.7 million broadband subscribers and 21,200 employees, operating in 29 states. We offer a broad portfolio of communications services for consumer and commercial customers. These services which include data and internet services, video services, voice services, access services, and advanced hardware and network solutions, are offered on either a standalone basis or in a bundled package, depending on each customer’s needs.  

 ﻿  

 On June 29, 2018, pursuant to the provisions of Frontier’s Certificate of Designation governing our Series A Preferred Stock, all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock converted at a rate of 1.3333 common shares per share of preferred stock into an aggregate of 26 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Frontier issued cash in lieu of fractional shares of common stock. These payments were recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital. In addition, on July 2, 2018, the Company paid the final dividend of $54 million to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred stock was issued in June 2015 when we completed a registered offering of 19.25 million preferred shares at an offering price of $100 per share.

 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” as modified (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method. Under this approach, prior period results were not restated to reflect the impact of ASC 606, resulting in limited comparability between 2017 and 2018 operating results. The table below reflects the results for the year ended December 31, 2018 under the historical method of accounting as well as under ASC 606. The significant adjustments have been broken out and a brief explanation for each provided. See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

 Discounts and Incentives  

 When customers purchase more than one service, the amount allocable to each service under ASC 606 is determined based upon the relative stand-alone selling price of each service received. While this change results in different allocations to each of the services, it does not change total customer revenue. Customer incentives (i.e., goods and or services offered for free) are considered separate performance obligations under ASC 606 and a portion of consideration received from the customer over the contract will be allocated to them. Other customer revenue is recognized when the incentives are granted to the customer and our performance obligation is satisfied. The costs for these incentives will continue to be recognized as marketing expense and included in Network access expenses.  

 ﻿  

 Upfront Fees  

 Under ASC 606, upfront non-refundable customer fees that provide the customer with a material right to renew must be deferred and amortized into revenue over the typical contract term. For our carrier customers, these were previously recognized as revenue when billed.   

 ﻿  

 Switched Access and USF Fees  

 Under ASC 606, switched access revenue, which has been historically reflected in Other regulatory revenue, is considered revenue from a customer; therefore, will be reflected in commercial customer revenue on a prospective basis. Universal Service Fund Fees assessed to our customers were previously reflected in regulatory revenue. Under ASC 606, these amounts are being included in contract value and allocated to the services which have been delivered based on relative stand-alone selling price of each service.  

 ﻿  

 The sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly consumer revenue per customer (ARPC) and consumer customer churn. We define churn as the number of consumer customer deactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average of each monthly churn in the period.   

 ﻿  

 Management believes that consumer customer counts and average monthly revenue per customer are important factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer customers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide additional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting all of our customers’ communications needs.

 Customer Trends and Revenue Performance  

 ﻿  

 We provide service and product options in our consumer and commercial offerings in each of our markets. As of December 31, 2018, 62% of our consumer broadband customers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.   

 ﻿  

 We had approximately 4.1 million and 4.4 million total consumer customers as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our average monthly consumer customer churn was 1.97% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2.17% for 2017. The consolidated average monthly consumer revenue per customer (consumer ARPC) increased by $3.02 or 4% to $83.98 during 2018 compared to the prior year. The overall increase in consumer ARPC is primarily a result of residential and broadband initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2018.  

 ﻿  

 We had approximately 411,000 and 453,000 total commercial customers as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We lost approximately 42,000 commercial customers during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a decrease of 49,000 customers for the prior year. Frontier expects the declines in voice services revenue and wireless backhaul revenues from commercial customers to continue in 2019. Our Ethernet product revenues from our SME (small business, medium business and larger enterprise customers) and carrier customers grew 8% compared to the prior year period.   

 ﻿  

 We had approximately 3.7 million and 3.9 million broadband subscribers as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we lost approximately 203,000 net broadband subscribers compared to a decrease of 333,000 for the prior year.   

 ﻿  

 We offer video services to certain of our customers under the FiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas, Florida, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington, and under the Vantage brand in portions of Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, and Ohio. We also offer satellite TV video service to our customers under an agency relationship with DISH® in all of our markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we lost approximately 153,000 net video subscribers across all markets. At December 31, 2018, we had 838,000 linear video subscribers that are served with FiOS or Vantage video service. In addition to our linear video subscribers, we have approximately 205,000 DISH satellite video customers.

 REVENUE  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 (1) Includes revenue from Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business, which was sold in May of 2017, of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

 ﻿  

 We generate revenues primarily through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage, and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of the provision for uncollectible amounts.   

 ﻿  

 The decrease of $532 million in consolidated total revenue was primarily due to decreased Voice services and Video services revenues driven by a decline in customers.  

 ﻿  

 Consolidated customer revenue decreased due to decreases in consumer customer revenue and commercial customer revenues of $212 million and $261 million, respectively. The decrease in consumer customer revenue was primarily due to decreases in voice, and video services revenue. We have experienced declines in the number of traditional voice customers and switched access minutes of use as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes, a trend we expect to continue. The decrease in consolidated commercial customer revenue was primarily driven by decreases in our voice services revenue and nonswitched revenue including wireless backhaul revenue and decreased revenues related to our Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business which was sold in May 2017.  

 ﻿  

 As part of ASC 606, switched access revenue was reclassified from Subsidy and other regulatory revenue to Other revenue on a prospective basis in 2018. Based on the accounting standard in place before adoption of ASC 606, switched access and subsidy and other regulatory revenue represented 8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Switched access revenue was $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 1% of our revenues, which decreased from $165 million, or 2% of our revenues, in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by reduced rates which were mandated by the 2011 Order with a related decline in operating expenses. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies, was $592 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or 7% of our revenues, which decreased from $611 million, or 7% of our revenues, in the prior year period.   

 ﻿  

 32  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five categories:  

 ﻿  

 Data and Internet services   

 Data and internet services include broadband services for consumer and commercial customers. We also provide data transmission services to high volume commercial customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits (“nonswitched access”) including services to wireless providers (“wireless backhaul”).   

 ﻿  

 Consolidated data and internet services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $87 million as compared with 2017. Consolidated data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $19 million, or 1%, as compared with 2017. Excluding the $40 million decrease caused by lost revenues attributable to the Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business, which was sold in May 2017, Data services revenue increased due to higher Consumer customer revenues and data equipment sales. This increase was slightly offset by lower Commercial customer revenues. Consolidated nonswitched access revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $68 million, or 4%, as compared with 2017.   

 ﻿  

 Voice services  

 Voice services include traditional local and long-distance wireline services, data-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as voice messaging services offered to our consumer and commercial customers. Voice services also include the long-distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our commercial customers and other carriers.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease of $295 million in voice services revenue was primarily due to the continued loss of voice customers and decreases in long-distance revenue among those customers that do not have a bundled long-distance plan.  

 ﻿  

 Video services  

 Video services include revenues generated from services provided directly to consumer customers through the FiOS video and Vantage video brands, and through DISH satellite TV services.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease of $120 million in video services revenue was primarily due to reduced revenue resulting from a decrease in the total number of video subscribers and customer package migration.  

 ﻿  

 Other   

 Other customer revenue includes switched access revenue and sales of Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) to our business customers and directory services. Switched access revenue includes revenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic (“switched access”). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies.  

 ﻿  

 As noted above, as part of our adoption of ASC 606, switched access was reclassified from switched access and subsidy revenue to other customer revenue on our consolidated statement of operations. Prior period results have not been adjusted to reflect this change.  

 ﻿  

 The increase of $29 million in other revenue was primarily due to a decrease in uncollectible revenue and an increase in service installations, which was partially offset by a decrease in directory services.  

 ﻿  

 Subsidy and other regulatory  

 Subsidy and other regulatory revenue includes revenues generated from cost subsidies from state and federal authorities, including the Connect America Fund Phase II.  

 ﻿  

 As noted above, as part of our adoption of ASC 606, full year 2018 revenue of $125 million for switched access services was reclassified from switched access and subsidy revenue to other customer revenue on our consolidated statement of operations. Prior period results have not been adjusted to reflect this change. Switched access revenue decreased as a result of reduced rates mandated by the Universal Service Fund/Intercarrier Compensation Report and Order with a related decline in operating expenses. We expect that switched access revenue will continue to decline in 2019.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease of $19 million in Subsidy and other regulatory revenue was primarily due to lower subsidy revenues attributable to the CAF II Program frozen support phasedown scheduled funding reductions.  

 ﻿

2018 OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2017  

 ﻿  

 Effective January 1, 2018, Frontier adopted ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” The standard requires certain benefit costs to be reclassified from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. This change in policy was applied using a retrospective approach and, accordingly, we have reclassified $2 million of net operating expenses, consisting of $1 million of Network related expenses and $1 million of Selling, general, and administrative expense, as non-operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additional pension settlement costs of $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, were reclassified from operating expense to non-operating expense. The following tables have been updated to reflect these reclassifications.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 NETWORK ACCESS EXPENSE  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Network access expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network, and video content costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude network related expenses, depreciation and amortization, and employee related expenses.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease in network access expenses was primarily due to lower video content costs as a result of the decline in video customers, combined with lower CPE costs and lower network costs.  

  NETWORK RELATED EXPENSES  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Network related expenses include expenses associated with the delivery of services to customers and the operation and maintenance of our network, such as facility rent, utilities, maintenance and other costs, as well as salaries, wages and related benefits associated with personnel who are responsible for the delivery of services, and the operation and maintenance of our network.   

 ﻿  

 The decrease in network related expenses was primarily due to reduced compensation and certain benefits costs, including pension and OPEB expense (as discussed below).  

 ﻿  

 34  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A expenses) include the salaries, wages and related benefits and costs of corporate and sales personnel, travel, insurance, non-network related rent, advertising and other administrative expenses.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by decreased employee headcount, compensation costs, certain benefits costs, including pension and OPEB expense (see table below), reduced facilities costs, and lower outside services costs.   

 ﻿  

 Pension and OPEB costs  

 Frontier allocates pension/OPEB expense, which includes only service costs, to network related expenses and SG&A expenses. Total consolidated pension and OPEB expense, excluding pension settlement costs and special termination benefits, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased as compared to 2017. The decrease in depreciation expense was due to lower net asset bases as compared to 2017. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily driven by the accelerated method of amortization related to customer bases acquired in 2010, 2014, and 2016.  

 ﻿  

 35  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  

 ﻿  

 As a result of the continued decline in the share price of our common stock in each of the final three quarters in 2018, we tested goodwill for impairment. Our third and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $641 million in 2018. The driver for the impairment in the third quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized EBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the fourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in utilized market multiple from 5.5x to 5.3x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole.   

 ﻿  

 ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Acquisition costs include financial advisory, accounting, regulatory, legal and other related costs. Integration costs include expenses that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition, which were incurred to integrate the network and information technology platforms. Integration costs also include costs to achieve synergies and operational efficiencies directly associated with the acquisition.   

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Restructuring costs and other charges consist of expenses related to changes in the composition of our business, including workforce reductions, the sale of business lines or divisions, and corresponding changes to our retirement plans. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we incurred $12 million and $82 million in costs directly related to these activities.  

 ﻿  

 In addition, costs related to the Transformation Program, a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the Company and reinvigorating growth, are included in Restructuring and other charges. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $23 million in costs directly associated with the Transformation Program.  

 ﻿  

 The $47 million decrease in restructuring costs and other charges was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of severed employees in 2018 as compared to 2017.  

 ﻿  

 36  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Investment and other income, net  

 The increase in Investment and other income, net was driven by an increase in non-operating pension and OPEB benefits of $10 million in 2018 compared to costs of $2 million in 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Pension settlement costs  

 Frontier recognized non-cash settlement charges of $41 million and $83 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The non-cash charge accelerated the recognition of a portion of the previously unrecognized actuarial losses in the Pension Plan.  

 ﻿  

 Gain (Loss) on early extinguishment of debt and debt exchanges  

 In 2018, Frontier recorded gains on the early extinguishment of debt and debt exchanges primarily due to discounts received on the retirement of certain notes. In 2017, Frontier recorded losses on the early extinguishment of debt and debt exchanges primarily due to premiums paid to retire certain notes and the unamortized original issuance costs.  

 ﻿  

 Interest expense  

 Interest expense remained relatively flat as compared to 2017. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 8.59% and 8.44%, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Income tax benefit  

 The decrease of $1,321 million in income tax benefit was driven by the tax impact of goodwill impairments during the year, and a decreased pre-tax loss. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 8.8% as compared with 43.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in our net deferred tax liabilities in 2018 was largely driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. We paid $4 million in federal and state taxes in 2018 as compared to net cash refunds of $51 million in 2017.   

 ﻿  

 Basic and Diluted Net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders   

 Net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders for 2018 was a net loss of $750 million, or $8.37 per share, as compared to a net loss of $2,018 million, or $25.99 per share, in 2017. For 2018, the decrease in net loss was primarily driven by decreased operating expenses and pension settlement costs, partially offset by decreased gain (loss) on extinguishments of debt and debt exchanges and the goodwill impairment charge.

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 2017 Compared to 2016  

 ﻿  

 On April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Verizon’s wireline properties in California, Texas, and Florida (the CTF Acquisition, of the CTF Operations). Frontier’s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially as a result of the completion of the CTF Acquisition. Historical financial and operating data presented for Frontier includes the results of the CTF Operations that were acquired in the CTF Acquisition from the date of acquisition on April 1, 2016. As a result, our financial results for 2017 include CTF Operations for the full year of 2017, while financial results for 2016 only included CTF Operations for the final nine months of 2016.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 The sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly consumer revenue per customer (ARPC) and consumer customer churn. We define churn as the number of consumer customer deactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average of each monthly churn in the period.

   (1)    2,283,000 consumer customers, 250,000 commercial customers and 2,533,000 total customers were acquired at the time of the April 2016 CTF Acquisition. 

   (2)    2,052,000 broadband subscribers and 1,165,000 video subscribers were acquired at the time of the April 2016 CTF Acquisition. 

   (3)    At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,900 employees in our Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business, which was sold in May 2017.

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 Customer Trends and Revenue Performance  

 ﻿  

 We provide service and product options in our consumer and commercial offerings in each of our markets. As of December 31, 2017, 67% of our consumer broadband customers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.   

 ﻿  

 We had approximately 4.4 million and 4.9 million total consumer customers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our average monthly consumer customer churn was 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2017 (1.91% for Frontier Legacy and 2.56% for CTF Operations) compared to 1.98% (1.76% for Frontier Legacy and 2.46% for CTF Operations) for 2016. The consolidated average monthly consumer revenue per customer (consumer ARPC) increased by $3.49 or 5% to $80.96 during 2017 compared to the prior year. The overall increase in consumer ARPC is a result of the increased revenue provided by a full year of CTF operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in video services.  

 ﻿  

 We had approximately 453,000 and 502,000 total commercial customers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We lost approximately 49,000 commercial customers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an increase of 213,000 customers for the prior year. Our Ethernet product revenues from our SME (small business, medium business and larger enterprise customers) and carrier customers grew 11% for the Frontier Legacy operations during 2017, compared to the prior year period. The prior year increase in customers was driven by 250,000 new customers acquired from Verizon in the CTF Acquisition.  

 ﻿  

 We had approximately 3.9 million and 4.3 million broadband subscribers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we lost approximately 333,000 net broadband subscribers compared to an increase of 1,809,000 for the prior year. The prior year increase in subscribers was driven by 2,052,000 new subscribers acquired from Verizon in the CTF Acquisition.   

 ﻿  

 We offer video services to certain of our customers under the FiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas, Florida, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington, and under the Vantage brand in portions of Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, and Ohio. We also offer satellite TV video service to our customers under an agency relationship with DISH® in all of our markets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we lost approximately 223,000 net video subscribers across all markets. At December 31, 2017, we had 961,000 linear video subscribers that are served with FiOS or Vantage video service. In addition to our linear video subscribers, we have approximately 235,000 DISH satellite video customers.

REVENUE  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 (1) Includes revenue from Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business, which was sold in May of 2017, of $40 million and $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 We generate revenues primarily through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage, and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of the provision for uncollectible amounts.   

 ﻿  

 The increase of $232 million in consolidated total revenue was primarily due to the additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreased voice and data and internet services revenues driven by a decline in customers.  

 ﻿  

 Consolidated customer revenue increased $93 million due to consumer customer revenue and $160 million due to commercial customer revenues. The increase in consumer customer revenue was primarily due to additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreases in voice, data and internet, and video services revenue. We have experienced declines in the number of traditional voice customers and switched access minutes of use as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes. The increase in consolidated commercial customer revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by decreases in our voice services revenue and nonswitched revenue including wireless backhaul revenue and decreased revenues related to our Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business which was sold in May 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Consolidated switched access and subsidy revenue represented 9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Switched access revenue was $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 2% of our revenues, which decreased from $170 million, or 2% of our revenues, in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by reduced rates which were mandated by the 2011 Order with a related decline in operating expenses. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies, was $611 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 7% of our revenues, which decreased from $626 million, or 7% of our revenues, in the prior year period.   

 ﻿  

 40  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five categories:  

 ﻿  

 Data and Internet services   

 Data and internet services include broadband services for consumer and commercial customers. We also provide data transmission services to high volume commercial customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits (“nonswitched access”) including services to wireless providers (“wireless backhaul”).   

 ﻿  

 Consolidated data and Internet services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $169 million as compared with 2016. Consolidated data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $81 million, or 4%, to $2,240 million due to the additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue as a result of the sale of the Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business in May 2017 and a decrease in the total number of broadband subscribers. Consolidated nonswitched access revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $88 million, or 6%, to $1,622 million as compared with 2016 due to additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower monthly recurring revenue for wireless backhaul and other carrier services.   

 ﻿  

 Voice services  

 Voice services include traditional local and long-distance wireline services, data-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as voice messaging services offered to our consumer and commercial customers. Voice services also include the long-distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our commercial customers and other carriers.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease of $22 million in voice services revenue was primarily due to the continued loss of voice customers and decreases in long-distance revenue among those customers that do not have a bundled long-distance plan, which was partially offset by additional revenues resulting from a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Video services  

 Video services include revenues generated from services provided directly to consumer customers through the FiOS video and Vantage video brands, and through DISH satellite TV services.  

 ﻿  

 The increase of $60 million in video services revenue was primarily due to additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. The increase was partially offset by reduced revenue resulting from a decrease in the total number of video subscribers.  

 ﻿  

 Other   

 Other customer revenue includes sales of customer premise equipment to our commercial customers and directory services, less our provision for bad debts.   

 ﻿  

 The increase of $46 million in other revenue was primarily due to a decrease in uncollectibles, which was partially offset by a decrease in maintenance contracts.  

 ﻿  

 Switched Access and Subsidy  

 Switched access and subsidy revenues include revenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic (“switched access”). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost subsidies from state and federal authorities, including the Connect America Fund.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease of $21 million in switched access and subsidy revenue was primarily due to decreases in subsidies from the state high cost, offset by additional revenue provided by a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to 2016.

 2017 OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2016  

 ﻿  

 Effective January 1, 2018, Frontier adopted ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” The standard requires certain benefit costs to be reclassified from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. This change in policy was applied using a retrospective approach and, accordingly, we have reclassified $2 million of net operating expenses, consisting of $1 million of Network related expenses and $1 million of Selling, general, and administrative expense and $23 million, consisting of $11 million of Network related expenses and $12 million of Selling, general, and administrative expense, as non-operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additional pension settlement costs of $83 million were reclassified from operating expense to non-operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following tables have been updated to reflect these reclassifications.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 NETWORK ACCESS EXPENSE  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Network access expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network, and video content costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude network related expenses, depreciation and amortization, and employee related expenses.  

 ﻿  

 The increase in network access expenses was primarily due to additional expenses resulting from a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016. These increases were partially offset by lower video content costs.  

  NETWORK RELATED EXPENSES  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Network related expenses include expenses associated with the delivery of services to customers and the operation and maintenance of our network, such as facility rent, utilities, maintenance and other costs, as well as salaries, wages and related benefits associated with personnel who are responsible for the delivery of services, and the operation and maintenance of our network.   

 ﻿  

 The increase in network related expenses was primarily due to additional expenses resulting from a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016 and an increase in outside services (primarily related to storm-related costs) which was partially offset by reduced compensation costs related to lower employee headcount and certain benefits, including pension and OPEB expense (as discussed below). There was also a reduction in rent expense as a result of more of the vehicle fleet being financed under capital leases than operating leases.  

 ﻿  

 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A expenses) include the salaries, wages and related benefits and the related costs of corporate and sales personnel, travel, insurance, non-network related rent, advertising and other administrative expenses.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by decreased employee headcount, compensation costs, certain benefits, including pension and OPEB expense (as discussed below), reduced marketing costs, lower outside   

 42  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

services costs and facilities. There were approximately $52 million of additional SG&A expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the Frontier Secure Strategic Partnerships business, which was sold in May 2017. The decrease was partially offset by additional expenses resulting from a full year of CTF Operations in 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Pension and OPEB costs  

 Frontier allocates pension/OPEB expense, which includes only service costs, to network related expenses and SG&A expenses. Total consolidated pension and OPEB expense, excluding pension settlement costs and special termination benefits, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:  

 ﻿

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  

 ﻿  

 The fair value estimates related to the allocation of the purchase price of the CTF Operations to Other intangibles were revised and finalized during the first quarter of 2017 from the previous estimates as of December 31, 2016. The allocation that was reported as of December 31, 2016 for Other intangibles increased $100 million, from $2,162 million to $2,262 million. These measurement period adjustments resulted in higher amortization expense during 2017 ($20 million of which is attributable to 2016).  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased as compared to 2016. The increase of $97 million in depreciation expense was due to additional depreciation of assets used for a full year of CTF Operations during 2017 compared to only nine months in 2016, which was partially offset by lower net asset bases as compared to 2016. The increase of $56 million in amortization expense was due to a full year of amortization of the CTF customer base during 2017 compared to amortization expense of only nine months in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  

 ﻿  

 As a result of the continued decline in the share price of our common stock in each of the four quarters in 2017, we tested goodwill for impairment. Our second and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million for 2017. The driver for the impairment in the second quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized EBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the fourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in utilized market multiple from 5.8x to 5.5x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole. The revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities which resulted from the enactment of Tax Cut and Job Act, caused further goodwill impairment.

ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Acquisition costs include financial advisory, accounting, regulatory, legal and other related costs. Integration costs include expenses that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition, which were incurred to integrate the network and information technology platforms. Integration costs also include costs to achieve synergies and operational efficiencies directly associated with the acquisition.   

 ﻿  

 We invested $34 million and $142 million in capital expenditures related to the CTF Acquisition during 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Restructuring costs and other charges consist of expenses related to changes in the composition of our business, including workforce reductions, the sale of business lines or divisions, and corresponding changes to our retirement plans.   

 ﻿  

 The $9 million decrease in restructuring costs and other charges was primarily driven by a reduction in special termination benefits related to the pension plan, partially offset by increased severance expense related to workforce reductions.

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Investment and other income, net  

 The decrease in investment and other income, net was due to less restricted cash on hand earning interest during 2017 as compared to the prior year, and the impact of a nonrecurring gain on the expiration/settlement of customer advances in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Pension settlement costs  

 The Pension Plan contains provisions that provide certain employees with the option of receiving a lump sum payment upon retirement. Frontier’s accounting policy is to record these payments as a settlement only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the Pension Plan’s net periodic pension benefit cost. During the year ended December 31, 2017, lump sum pension settlement payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $486 million, which exceeded the settlement threshold of $224 million, and as a result, Frontier recognized non-cash settlement charges totaling $83 million during 2017. The non-cash charge accelerated the recognition of a portion of the previously deferred unrecognized actuarial losses, which are included in Other comprehensive income, in the Pension Plan.  

 ﻿  

 Losses on early extinguishment of debt and debt exchanges  

 The increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and debt exchanges was primarily driven by premiums to retire certain notes and the unamortized original issuance costs, which was slightly offset by discounts received on the retirement of certain notes.  

 ﻿  

 Interest expense  

 Interest expense was relatively flat as compared to 2016. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 8.44% and 8.55%, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 Income tax benefit  

 The increase of $1,133 million in income tax benefit was driven by a decrease in the federal tax rate on our deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets, partially offset by the tax impact of goodwill impairments during the year, along with an increased pre-tax loss. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 43.4% as compared with 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our net deferred tax liabilities was largely driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. We received $51 million in federal and state tax refunds in 2017 as compared to net cash refunds of $120 million in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders   

 Net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders for 2017 was a net loss of $2,018 million, or $25.99 per share, as compared to a net loss of $587 million, or $7.61 per share, in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Diluted net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders  

 Diluted net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders for 2017 was a net loss of $2,018 million, or $25.99 per share, as compared to a net loss of $587 million, or $7.61 per share, in 2016.

 (b) Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 ﻿  

 Analysis of Cash Flows  

 As of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents aggregating $354 million. Our primary source of funds during 2018 was cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash received from issuance of our second lien notes, incremental borrowings under the Term Loan B, and borrowings on our Revolver (as defined below). In 2018, we used these funds principally for our cash investing and financing activities, primarily capital expenditures, dividends on our preferred stock, and servicing our debt.   

 ﻿  

 On April 1, 2016, we used the restricted cash obtained from net proceeds of the September 2015 senior notes offering and June 2015 equity offerings, along with additional borrowings and cash on hand, to finance the CTF Acquisition.  

 ﻿  

 At December 31, 2018, we had a working capital deficit of $1,231 million, as compared to a working capital deficit of $1,185 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in the working capital deficit is primarily due to an increase in our borrowings under the Revolver, offset by the addition of contract acquisition costs and other short-term contract assets as part of the adoption of ASC 606, in addition to decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable.  

 ﻿  

 Cash Flows provided from Operating Activities  

 ﻿  

 Net cash provided from operating activities remained relatively stable, decreasing $38 million, or 2%, to $1,812 million in 2018 as compared to 2017.   

 ﻿  

 We paid $4 million in net cash taxes in 2018 as compared to net cash tax refunds of $51 million and $120 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 In connection with the CTF and Connecticut Acquisitions, Frontier recognized acquisition and integration costs of $25 million during 2017 compared to $436 million during 2016. Interest expense of $755 million was incurred during 2016 related to the September 2015 debt offering and the JPM Credit Agreement (as defined below). Additionally, Frontier incurred $10 million of interest expense related to the Verizon Bridge Facility in 2016.   

 ﻿  

 Cash Flows used by Investing Activities  

 ﻿  

 Capital Expenditures  

 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our capital expenditures were, respectively, $1,192 million, $1,188 million and $1,401 million (including $34 million and $142 million of integration-related capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016, respectively, associated with the CTF Acquisition and the Connecticut Acquisition).   

 ﻿  

 CTF Acquisition  

 On April 1, 2016, Frontier acquired the wireline operations of Verizon in California, Texas and Florida for a purchase price of $10.54 billion in cash and assumed debt (the CTF Acquisition), pursuant to the February 5, 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement, as amended. In addition, Frontier and Verizon settled the working capital and net debt adjustments with $15 million paid to Frontier in October 2016.  

 ﻿  

 Cash Flows used by and provided from Financing Activities  

 ﻿  

 Proceeds from Debt Borrowings  

 During 2018, 2017, and 2016, proceeds from long-term debt borrowings were $1,840 million, $1,500 million and $1,940 million, respectively, consisting of senior secured debt. In addition, we had net borrowings of $275 million on our Revolver (as defined below) during 2018. Refer to note 8 for details of the specific transactions.   

 ﻿  

 Debt Reduction  

 During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $2,578 million, $1,815 million and $453 million, respectively, consisting of the retirement of $2,198 million, $1,655 million and $23 million, respectively, of senior unsecured debt and $380 million, $159 million, and $430 million, respectively, of secured debt.   

 ﻿  

 Subject to limitations contained in our indentures and credit facilities, we may from time to time make repurchases of our debt in the open market, through tender offers, by exercising rights to call or in privately negotiated transactions. We may also refinance or restructure existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations or equity securities. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, would be decided upon at

the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on market conditions, trading levels of the Company's debt from time to time, the Company's cash position and other considerations.  

 ﻿  

 Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A)  

 On June 29, 2018, all outstanding shares of Frontier’s 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) converted at a rate of 1.3333 common shares per share of preferred stock into an aggregate of approximately 25,529,000 shares (net of fractional shares) of the Company’s common stock, pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation governing the Series A Preferred Stock. Frontier issued cash in lieu of fractional shares of common stock in the conversion. These payments were recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital. The final dividend was paid on July 2, 2018.  

 ﻿  

 We initially issued 19,250,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock in a registered offering in June 2015. Aggregate net proceeds of the offering were $1,866 million after deducting commissions and expenses. We used the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the acquisition price of the CTF Acquisition and for related fees and expenses.   

 ﻿  

 Capital Resources  

 We are highly leveraged, and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs will arise from debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and from funding the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures. Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations, cash on hand and proceeds from debt borrowings, including issuances of long-term debt and $850 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolver (as reduced by any Standby Letters of Credit outstanding under the JPM Credit Agreement). As of our date of filing, we believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, existing revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets, as necessary, will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt interest and principal payments, pay taxes and support our short-term and long-term operating strategies for the next twelve months as of the date of filing. A number of factors, including but not limited to, losses of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic conditions may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had $539 million and $437 million of long-term debt maturing in 2019 and 2020, respectively, excluding interest obligations.   

 ﻿  

 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities  

 ﻿  

 JP Morgan Credit Facilities  

 ﻿  

 On February 27, 2017, Frontier entered into a first amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to which Frontier combined its revolving credit agreement, dated as of June 2, 2014, and its term loan credit agreement, dated as of August 12, 2015. Under the JPM Credit Agreement (as amended to date, the JPM Credit Agreement), Frontier has a $1,625 million senior secured Term Loan A facility (the Term Loan A) maturing on March 31, 2021, an $850 million secured revolving credit facility maturing on February 27, 2022 (the Revolver), and a $1,740 million senior secured Term Loan B facility (the Term Loan B) maturing on June 15, 2024. The maturities of the Term Loan A, the Revolver, and the Term Loan B, in each case if still outstanding, will be accelerated in the following circumstances: (i) if, 91 days before the maturity date of any series of senior notes maturing in 2020, 2023 and 2024, more than $500 million in principal amount remains outstanding on such series; or (ii) if, 91 days before the maturity date of the first series of senior notes maturing in 2021 or 2022, more than $500 million in principal amount remains outstanding, in the aggregate, on the two series of senior notes maturing in such year. As of December 31, 2018, less than $500 million in principal amount remains outstanding on the senior notes due 2020 and on the two series of senior notes maturing in 2021.  

 ﻿  

 The determination of interest rates for each of the facilities under the JPM Credit Agreement is based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement) or over LIBOR, at the election of Frontier. Interest rate margins on the Term Loan A and Revolver (ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.75% to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustment based on Frontier’s Leverage Ratio (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). The interest rate on the Term Loan A and the Revolver as of December 31, 2018 was LIBOR plus 2.75%. Interest rate margins on the Term Loan B (2.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are not subject to adjustment. The security package under the JPM Credit Agreement includes pledges of the equity interests in certain Frontier subsidiaries and guarantees by certain Frontier subsidiaries.  

 ﻿  

 On January 25, 2018, Frontier amended the JPM Credit Agreement to, among other things, expand the security package to include the interests of certain subsidiaries previously not pledged and replace the leverage ratio maintenance test with a first lien leverage ratio maintenance test. On July 3, 2018, Frontier further amended the JPM   

 47  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Credit Agreement to, among other things, replace certain operating subsidiary equity pledges with pledges of the equity interest of certain direct subsidiaries of Frontier.  

 ﻿  

 CoBank Credit Facility  

 ﻿  

 Frontier has a $315 million senior term loan facility drawn in October 2016 (as amended to date, the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement) with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, lead arranger and a lender, and the other lenders. Frontier had a separate $350 million senior term loan facility drawn in 2014 (the 2014 CoBank Credit Agreement) with CoBank which was repaid in full on July 3, 2018 (See Note 8), We refer to the 2014 CoBank Credit Agreement and the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement collectively as the CoBank Credit Agreements.   

 ﻿  

 The 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement matures on October 12, 2021. Borrowings under the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement bears interest based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement) or over LIBOR, at the election of Frontier. Interest rate margins under the facility will range from 0.875% to 3.875% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.875% to 4.875% for LIBOR borrowings, subject to adjustment based on our Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement. The interest rate on the facility as of December 31, 2018 was LIBOR plus 4.875%.   

 ﻿  

 On January 25, 2018 Frontier amended the CoBank Credit Agreements to, among other things, expand the security package to include the interests of certain subsidiaries previously not pledged and replace the leverage ratio maintenance test with a first lien leverage ratio maintenance test. On July 3, 2018, Frontier further amended the CoBank Credit Agreements to, among other things, replace certain operating subsidiary equity pledges with pledges of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries of Frontier.  

 ﻿  

 Letters of Credit Facility   

 ﻿  

 Frontier has a Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo – Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD. (the LC Agreements). Frontier can also issue letters of credit under the Revolver up to a maximum of $134 million. As of December 31, 2018, $74 million and $71 million of undrawn Standby Letters of Credit had been issued under the LC Agreements and Revolver respectively. Letters of credit under the LC Agreements are secured by a security package identical to those contained in the JPM Credit Amendment.  

 ﻿  

 Covenants   

 ﻿  

 The terms and conditions contained in our indentures, the JPM Credit Agreement and the CoBank Credit Agreement, include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the incurrence of liens on our assets securing indebtedness and our subsidiaries’ assets, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness by our subsidiaries and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control subject to important qualifications and exceptions.   

 ﻿  

 Under the credit agreements Frontiers is subject to a first lien net leverage ratio maintenance test which provides for a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, stepping down to 1.35 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2020 and thereafter. The covenants provide for junior lien capacity on any indebtedness permitted under the credit agreements, while limiting the incurrence of first lien debt. Additionally, the credit agreements prohibit us from using proceeds from our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments if the undrawn amount under the Revolver is less than $250 million, and we may not pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $2.40 per share in any fiscal year.  

 ﻿  

 Indentures governing our second lien notes, senior notes and debentures limit our ability to create liens on our assets securing indebtedness and our subsidiaries’ assets or merge or consolidate with other companies, our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow funds and to engage in change of control transactions, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. Our second lien notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees credit agreements. In addition, the second lien notes are secured on a second-priority basis by all the assets that secure our obligations under the credit agreements on a first-priority basis.  

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and the credit agreements.

Preferred Dividends  

 Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 11.125% of the initial liquidation preference of $100 per share, or $11.125 per year per share. Series A Preferred Stock dividends of $107 million were paid during 2018. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 1.3333 shares of our common stock on June 29, 2018.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements.  

 ﻿  

 Future Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

 A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 is as follows:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 During 2018, we decreased our outstanding performance letters of credit from $192 million to $145 million at December 31, 2018.  

 ﻿  

 On April 29, 2015, the FCC released its right of first refusal offer of support to price cap carriers under the CAF Phase II program, which is intended to provide long-term support for broadband in high-cost unserved or underserved areas. In June 2015, Frontier accepted the CAF Phase II offer, which provides for $332 million in annual support, including $49 million in annual support related to the properties acquired in the CTF Acquisition, through 2020 to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to approximately 774,000 households across certain of the 29 states where we now operate.  

 ﻿  

 To the extent we do not enable the required number of households with 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service by the end of the CAF Phase II term, we will be required to return a portion of the funds previously received.  

 ﻿  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 ﻿  

 The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The estimates which require the most significant judgment are listed below.  

 ﻿  

 These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 ﻿  

 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

 We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations, including payment history, customer financial performance, carrier billing disputes and aging analysis. Our estimation process includes general and specific reserves and varies by customer category. In 2018 and 2017, we had no “critical estimates” related to bankruptcies   

 49  

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

of communications companies or any other significant customers. See Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.  

 ﻿  

 Indefinite-lived Intangibles   

 Our indefinite-lived intangibles consist primarily of goodwill, which were generated as a result of business combinations. We test for impairment of these assets annually as of December 31 or more frequently, whenever events occur, or facts and circumstances change that make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. Events that might indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, material negative changes in relationships with significant customers, and/or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period.   

 ﻿  

 We early adopted ASU 2017-04 “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”) during the second quarter of 2017. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, our annual goodwill impairment test (and interim test if determined to be necessary) will consist of comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment will be recognized.   

 ﻿  

 For the purpose of our goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. If it is less, an additional quantitative evaluation must be performed. Our quantitative assessment consists of using a market multiples approach to determine fair value. Marketplace company comparisons and analyst reports within the wireline telecommunications industry have historically supported a range of fair values of multiples between 4.4x and 6.5x annualized EBITDA (defined as operating income, net of acquisition and integration costs, pension/OPEB expense, pension settlement costs, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment, storm-related costs, work stoppage costs, and restructuring costs and other charges, as well as depreciation and amortization).   

 ﻿  

 During 2018, our common stock declined and traded at historically low prices. As a result, we tested goodwill for impairment in each of the final three quarters of 2018. Our third and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $641 million for 2018. The driver for the impairment in the third quarter was a reduction in our profitability and utilized EBITDA estimate, which when applied to our market multiple resulted in a lower enterprise valuation. During the fourth quarter, the impairment was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation resulting from a reduction in utilized market multiple from 5.5x to 5.3x reflecting the lower outlook for our industry as a whole. The first and second quarter quantitative assessments did not result in goodwill impairment charges. In estimating the enterprise fair value, we used 5.5x as the multiple for the first three quarters of 2018 and 5.3x for the fourth quarter test.   

 ﻿  

 The market multiples approach that we use incorporates significant estimates and assumptions related to the forecasted results for the remainder of the year, including revenues, expenses, and the achievement of other cost synergies. Our assessment includes many qualitative factors that require significant judgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding the need for, or size of, an impairment. Continued declines in our profitability or cash flows or in sustained low trading prices of our common stock may result in further impairment.   

 ﻿  

 The enterprise fair value is sensitive to the amount of EBITDA generated by Frontier and the EBITDA multiple used in the calculation. Significant changes in the assumptions or estimates used in our impairment analyses, such as a reduction in profitability and/or cash flows, could result in a non-cash goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and materially affect our operating results. The market multiples approach is sensitive to changes in the estimated annual EBITDA, with each $100 million change equating to approximately $530 million of estimated enterprise value. Similarly, a ten-basis point change in the multiple used would affect the estimated enterprise value by approximately $350 million. Sustained low trading prices for our common stock could also affect the reconciliation of our market capitalization and indicate further impairment.   

 ﻿  

 We also considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain finite-lived intangible assets were impaired, noting no impairment was present as of December 31, 2018.

Depreciation   

 The calculation of depreciation expense is based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our property, plant and equipment assets. The estimates for remaining lives of the various asset categories are determined annually, based on an independent study. Among other considerations, these studies include models that consider actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution for each category of asset. The latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and did not result in any significant changes in remaining lives for any of our asset categories. A one year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would result in an increase of approximately $159 million to depreciation expense.

 Asset Impairments  

 We review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists and long-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When triggering events are identified, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required.  

 ﻿  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

 We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former employees as well as other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. As of December 31, 2018, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $1,789 million. During 2018, we contributed $114 million to these plans in cash along with real estate properties contribution with an aggregate fair value of $37 million and recorded $111 million of operating expense before capitalization and $30 million of net non-operating expense, including $41 million of pension settlement costs. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  

 ﻿  

 Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields.  

 ﻿  

 We are utilizing a discount rate of 4.30% as of December 31, 2018 for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 3.70% and 4.10% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2018 was a range of 4.30% to 4.40% compared to a range of 3.70% to 3.80% in 2017 and 4.10% to 4.30% in 2016.  

 ﻿  

 In the following table, we show the estimated sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year

investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 40% in long-duration fixed income securities, and 60% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%. Our actual return on plan assets in 2018 was (5.59)%. For 2019, we will assume a rate of return of 7.50%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date.

 Income Taxes   

 We file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in governing law or review by taxing authorities.  

 ﻿  

 We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we are not able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.
