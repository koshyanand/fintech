Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  

 ﻿  

 We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and 

   ·    Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. 

 ﻿  

 Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, and the euro. We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts. In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.  

 ﻿  

 We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions as our counterparties. We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default. Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.   

 ﻿  

 Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers. We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies. A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues are denominated in Japanese yen. When these revenues are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen. To protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.   

 ﻿  

 We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2018, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.0 billion compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.  

 ﻿  

 Interest Rate Risk Management   

 ﻿  

 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate derivatives agreements. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts of $300 million to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance. The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, and were settled with $16 million received on October 31, 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance.
