INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors of Ilim S.A.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Ilim S.A. and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ilim S.A. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Financial statements

These consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require the use of management’s estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as the recoverability of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, obligations related to employee benefits, useful lives of plant, properties and equipment and intangible assets, asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation obligations, legal and tax contingencies, valuation of inventories, financial instruments and deferred tax assets, including valuation allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

Nature of business

The principal activity of Ilim S.A. (formerly Ilim Holding S.A., see details below) (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together – the “Group”) is forestry and pulp and paper production.  

The Group was formed in 2006 as a result of the restructuring of a group of legal entities under common control, collectively referred to as Ilim Pulp Group.

Ilim S.A. is a joint stock company incorporated in Switzerland. The Company is a joint venture of International Paper Company (“IP”) and a group of Russian shareholders. IP and the Russian shareholders (collectively) each own 50% of the Company’s shares.

The Group’s manufacturing operations are located in the Russian Federation and sales are made in Russia and abroad. At December 31, 2018, the Group employed 16,613 employees (December 31, 2017: 16,824 employees).

The Group consists of 8 legal entities (December 31, 2017: 10 entities) which are incorporated in the Russian Federation (except as otherwise indicated).

The Company’s ownership and voting power in its subsidiaries were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*On December 12, 2018 Ilim Trading S.A. was merged into Ilim Holding S.A., and Ilim Holding S.A.’s name was changed to Ilim S.A.

JSC Ilim Group has branches in Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk and Koryazhma, Russia, where the three pulp and paper mills are located.

Consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.

Investments in joint ventures where the Company has significant influence over their operations are accounted for by the equity method.

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Revenue recognition

Generally, the Group recognizes revenue on a point-in-time basis when the customer takes title to the goods and assumes the risks and rewards for the goods.

The Group’s revenue is primarily derived from fixed consideration; however, we do have contract terms that give rise to variable consideration, primarily cash discounts and volume rebates.  

The Group offers early payment discounts to customers across the Group’s businesses. Management estimates the expected cash discounts and other customer refunds based on the historical experience across the Group’s portfolio of customers to record reductions in revenue which is consistent with the most likely amount method outlined in ASC 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," (new revenue standard). Management has concluded that this method is the best estimate of the consideration the Group will be entitled to from its customers.

The Group has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset the Company would recognize is one year or less, and not record interest income or interest expense when the difference in timing of control or transfer and customer payment is one year or less.

On January 1, 2018, the Group adopted the new revenue recognition standard and all related amendments, using the modified retrospective method. We have analyzed revenue streams and terms of contracts with customers indicating that the adoption of the standard did not require a change in the amount of revenue recognized. 

In order to meet new revenue standard’s requirements, management has considered certain qualitative and quantitative information to be disclosed in Note 4 so that the financial statements’ users can better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenue and cash flows generated from contracts with customers.

Annual maintenance costs

Costs of repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, cash held on demand with banks, bank deposits repayable on demand without penalty and bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost plus interest accrued, which approximates market value. Bank deposits with original maturities of more than three months are classified as short-term or long-term investments depending on the expected maturity and are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. 

Cost is determined on the weighted average basis.

Plant, properties and equipment

Plant, properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized, whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated.

Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in other operating income or expense.

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the date they are ready for use. Land, assets under construction and equipment for installation are not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Leasing

Leasing transactions are classified according to the lease agreements which specify the rewards and risks associated with the leased property. Leasing transactions where the Group is the lessee are classified as capital or operating leases. In a capital lease, the Group receives the major portion of the economic benefits of the leased property and recognizes the assets and associated liability on its consolidated balance sheet. All other transactions, in which the Group is the lessee, are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recorded as expense.

Intangible assets

All of the Group’s intangible assets have finite useful lives and include primarily computer software, patents, and licenses. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method from the date they are ready for use over their estimated useful lives as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Goodwill

Goodwill related to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of the applicable segment. Annual testing for possible goodwill impairment is performed at the end of the year, with additional interim testing performed when management believes that it is more likely than not events and circumstances have occurred that would result in the impairment of the reporting unit’s goodwill.

In calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one, the Company uses the projected future cash flows to be generated by each unit, discounted using the estimated discount rate for each reporting unit. For reporting units whose recorded value of net assets plus goodwill is in excess of their estimated fair values, the fair values of the individual assets are determined to calculate the amount of any goodwill impairment charge required.

Forestlands

The Group uses forests for logging from local forestry authorities under 49-year agreements, cancellable by the Group at any time. Logging volumes and other conditions are determined annually. The Group does not own the trees until they are harvested. At December 31, 2018, the Group has exclusive harvesting rights on forest areas exceeding 18.9 million acres  

(7.7 million hectares) (December 31, 2016: 16.4 million acres (6.6 million hectares)).

(All amounts are presented in thousands of US Dollars, unless otherwise stated)

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Impairment of long-lived assets

Long-lived assets (or groups of assets) are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A recoverability test is performed based on undiscounted cash flows, requiring judgments as to the weighting of operational alternatives being considered by management and estimates of the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from the use of long-lived assets generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are carried at face value, less an allowance for doubtful accounts.  

An allowance for doubtful accounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.

The primary factors that the Group considers in determining whether receivables are impaired are their overdue status and the reliability of related collateral, if any. Other principal criteria used to determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has occurred, are as follows:

•the counterparty experiences a significant financial difficulty as evidenced by its financial information;

•the counterparty considers bankruptcy or a financial reorganization;

•there is an adverse change in the payment status of the counterparty as a result of changes in the national or local economic conditions that impact the counterparty.

The amount of the allowance is the difference between the face value and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest for similar borrowers that prevailed when the receivable was originated. Uncollectible receivables are written off against the related allowance for doubtful accounts after all necessary procedures to recover the receivables have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the impairment loss account within the consolidated statement of operations.

Loans issued to shareholders

Loans issued to shareholders are recorded as a reduction of equity.

Debt

Debt includes bank loans and finance lease liabilities. Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method; any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the redemption amount is recognized as interest expense over the period of the debt. Interest payable on debt is included in other accruals and liabilities.

Income taxes

The Group uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years, in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016

(All amounts are presented in thousands of US Dollars, unless otherwise stated)

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The Group records its tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Where the Group believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the Group’s evaluation of the “more likely than not” outcome considering the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and the facts of each matter. Changes to recorded liabilities are made only when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, a change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.

While the judgments and estimates made by the Group are based on management’s evaluation of the technical merits of a matter, assisted as necessary by consultation with outside consultants, historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts, resulting in charges or credits that could materially affect future financial statements.

The Group provides valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the historical taxable income generation, projected future taxable income, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.

Environmental remediation costs

Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value when the amount and timing of expected cash payments are reliably determinable.

Translation of financial statements

Functional and presentation currency

After the merger of Ilim Trading S.A. into Ilim S.A., the functional currency of the Company was changed from the Swiss Franc (CHF) to the US dollar (USD). The change in functional currency was applied on a prospective basis.

The functional currency of the Group’s entities domiciled in the Russian Federation is the Russian Ruble (RUB). Functional currencies noted above reflect the economic substance of the underlying events and the circumstances of the Group entities.

The US dollar has been chosen as the presentation currency for these consolidated financial statements.

Translation of foreign currency items into functional currency

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of each entity in the Group, at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date, into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates are recognized in the statement of operations.

(All amounts are presented in thousands of US Dollars, unless otherwise stated)

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Translation from functional to presentation currency

The results and financial position are translated from functional currency into US dollars for presentation purposes using the following procedures:

•assets and liabilities for each balance sheet are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;

•share capital and other equity components are translated at historical rates;

•income and expenses for each statement of operations and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average monthly exchange rates that approximate the translation using the actual transaction date rates; and

•all resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component of equity in other comprehensive income.

Value-added tax

Output value-added tax (“VAT”) related to sales is payable to tax authorities on the earlier of (a) collection of the receivables from customers or (b) delivery of the goods or services to customers. Input VAT is generally recoverable against output VAT upon receipt of the VAT invoice. The tax authorities permit the settlement of VAT on a net basis. VAT related to purchases, where all the specified conditions for recovery have not been met yet, is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet and disclosed separately within current assets, while input VAT that has been claimed is netted off with the output VAT payable. Where an allowance has been made for the impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the receivable, including VAT.

Financial instruments

Financial instruments – key measurement terms

Depending on their classification, financial instruments are carried at fair value or amortized cost as described below.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  

an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

The fair value of current financial assets and liabilities approximates their carrying amounts.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models, or models based on recent arm’s length transactions, or consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial instruments for which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are analyzed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows:  

(i) level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements are valuation techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs).

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016

(All amounts are presented in thousands of US Dollars, unless otherwise stated)

1.SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Transaction costs are costs to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability, that are directly attributable to the disposal of the asset or the transfer of the liability and meet both of the following criteria: they result directly from and are essential to the transaction and they wouldn’t have been incurred by the entity had the decision to sell an asset or transfer the liability not been made. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting as selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal administrative or holding costs.

Amortized cost is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognized at initial recognition less cash collected, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets, less any write-down to date. Accrued interest includes amortization of transaction costs deferred at initial recognition and of any premium or discount to the maturity amount using the effective interest method. Accrued interest income and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortized discount or premium (including fees deferred at origination, if any), are not presented separately and are included in the carrying values of the related items in the consolidated balance sheet.

2.RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Certain new standards, pronouncements have been issued that are mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 or later, and which the Group has not early adopted:

Fair value measurement

In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2018-13, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement." The new guidance modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Implementation on a prospective or retrospective basis varies by specific disclosure requirement. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance; however, we do not anticipate a material impact on the financial statements.

Retirement Benefits 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans." This guidance adds, removes, and clarifies disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented.  

The Group early adopted the provisions of this guidance in 2018 with no material impact on the financial statements.

Intangibles 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract." The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).  

The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this guidance. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.

(All amounts are presented in thousands of US Dollars, unless otherwise stated)

2.RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS (CONTINUED)

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." This guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 of today's goodwill impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. This guidance should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, for any impairment test performed in 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance; however, we do not anticipate that the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 

Cash Flow Classification

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).” The primary purpose of the ASU is to reduce the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles in the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The ASU's amendments add or clarify guidance on eight cash flow issues, including; (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of borrowing; (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (6) distributions received from equity method investees; (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods with those years and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented but may be applied prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. The Group adopted the provisions of this guidance in 2018 with no material impact to the financial statements.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases”. This ASU will require most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet which will increase reported assets and liabilities. Lessor accounting will remain substantially similar to current US GAAP. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, and mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities. 

The Group will adopt this guidance using the newly approved transition method. We will recognize a liability and corresponding asset associated with in-scope operating and finance leases.  

The Group is in the final stages of determining those amounts and processes required to account for leasing activity on an ongoing basis. Based on a preliminary assessment of existing operating leases, we expect to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability upon adoption of approximately $ 90 million, based upon the present value of the remaining rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases.

4.SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION 

Cash and cash equivalents

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash transactions are conducted through high-credit-quality financial institutions. Cash is placed with financial institutions (most of them are rated from A to BBB- based on Standard and Poor's and Fitch national ratings for the Russian Federation), which are considered at the time of deposit to have minimal risk of default.

Accounts receivable

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A substantial majority of the Group’s customers operate in the pulp and paper industry.  

As a result, the Group’s exposure to credit risk may be affected by negative developments in the industry. In addition, the top ten customers of the Group comprise 50% of the Group’s gross trade receivables at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: 47%) and default of any of these customers may have a significant effect on the Group. There is a long-standing history of trading relationships with these customers with no defaults in the past.

Other accruals and liabilities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The customer advances represent a contract liability that is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Group transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The majority of our customer prepayments are received during the fourth quarter of each year for goods that will be transferred to customers over the following twelve months.

4.SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The nature of the Group's contracts can vary based on the business, customer type and region; however, in all instances it is the Group's customary business practice to receive a valid order from the customer, in which each parties' rights and related payment terms are clearly identifiable.

Contracts or purchase orders with customers could include a single type of product or it could include multiple types/grades of products. Regardless, the contracted price with the customer is agreed to at the individual product level outlined in the customer contracts or purchase orders. The Group does not bundle prices; however, we do negotiate with customers on pricing and rebates for the same products based on a variety of factors (e.g. level of contractual volume, geographical location, etc.). Management has concluded that the prices negotiated with each individual customer are representative of the stand-alone selling price of the product.

Shipping and handling costs

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2018 and 2017, the Group utilized part of its tax loss carryforwards. The remaining tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018, in the amount of $ 687 are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption deferred income tax assets and have an unlimited life. Taking this into account and having assessed the Group’s cash flow forecasts in the context of current and projected market conditions, the Group concluded that it is not more likely than not that any portion of the deferred taxes will not be realized; and therefore, no valuation allowance was recorded against the Group’s deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

The Group does not recognize a deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with the accumulated retained earnings of the Group subsidiaries at the beginning of the respective year, as these earnings are considered indefinitely invested. Future dividends, if any, will be paid out of earnings of the current year and subsequent years. No such deferred tax liability is recorded for this temporary difference at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: nil). Temporary differences for which no deferred taxes are provided are $ 283,363 (December 31, 2017: $ 294,212).

6.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Operating environment of the Group

Emerging markets such as Russia are subject to different risks than more developed markets, including economic, political and social, and legal and legislative risks. Laws and regulations affecting businesses in Russia continue to change rapidly and tax and regulatory frameworks are subject to varying interpretations. The Russian economy was growing in 2018 and 2017, after overcoming the economic recession of 2016 and previous years. The future economic direction  

of Russia is heavily influenced by the fiscal and monetary policies adopted by the government, together with developments in the legal, regulatory, and political environment. Because Russia produces and exports large volumes of oil and gas, its economy is particularly sensitive to the price of oil and gas on the world market.

Starting from 2014, sanctions have been imposed in several packages by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain Russian officials, businessmen and companies. This led to reduced access of the Russian businesses to international capital markets.

The impact of further economic and political developments on future operations and the financial position of the Group is uncertain but might be significant.

Tax legislation

Russian tax and customs legislation, which was enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, is subject to varying interpretations when being applied to the transactions and activities of the Group. Consequently, tax positions taken by management and the formal documentation supporting the tax positions may be challenged by the tax authorities. Russian tax administration is gradually strengthening, including the fact that there is a higher risk of review of tax transactions without a clear business purpose or with tax incompliant counterparties. There are also cases, where companies were penalized by the tax authorities for their counterparties not being compliant with VAT legislation. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities, with respect to taxes, for three calendar years preceding the year when decisions about the review were made. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.

The Russian transfer pricing legislation is to a large extent, based on international transfer pricing principles developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This legislation provides the possibility for tax authorities to make transfer pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities, with respect to controlled transactions (transactions with related parties and some types of transactions with unrelated parties), provided that the transaction price is not arm’s length. Management has implemented internal controls to be in compliance with this transfer pricing legislation.

Tax liabilities arising from transactions between companies are determined using actual transaction prices. It is possible, with the evolution of the interpretation of the transfer pricing rules, that such transfer prices could be challenged. The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial position and/or the overall operations of the Group.

As Russian tax legislation does not provide definitive guidance in certain areas, the Group adopts, from time to time, interpretations of such uncertain areas that reduce the overall tax rate of the Group. While management currently estimates that it is probable that tax positions and interpretations will be sustained, there is a possible risk that an outflow of resources will be required should such tax positions and interpretations be challenged by the tax authorities.  

The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial position and/or the overall operations of the Group.

The Group recognized additional tax obligations from its exposure to different tax risks assessed by tax authorities due to examinations of prior periods and the additional tax liability recorded is $ 143 at December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: $285). These tax obligations are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as other liabilities. Management will vigorously defend the entity's positions and interpretations that were applied in determining tax charges, benefits, assets and obligations recognized in these consolidated financial statements.

6.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

The Company’s management estimated the risk of accrual additional taxes, penalties and fines, the total of which is believed to be less than 1% of revenue as at December 31, 2018.

Legal proceedings

From time to time and in the normal course of business, claims against the Group may be received. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Group estimates that it does not have any material potential obligations from exposure to possible legal risks.

Environmental matters

The enforcement of environmental regulation in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities is continually being reconsidered. The Group annually evaluates its obligations under environmental regulations. As obligations are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable, they are recognized immediately. Potential liabilities, which might arise as a result of changes in existing regulations, civil litigation or legislation are uncertain but could be material.

Forestry legislation

The Group’s logging activities are subject to the forestry legislation of the Russian Federation. Management believes that the Group’s activities are in compliance with current legislation.

The Group has an obligation to perform reforestation of the timberland it harvests. This obligation arises and the liability for the respective costs is recorded when the Group commences harvesting of a particular plot. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Group had substantially fulfilled its obligations.

Insurance matters

The Group is subject to political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments and risks, which are not covered by insurance. No provisions for self-insurance are required and therefore are not included in these consolidated financial statements. The occurrence of significant losses and impairments could have a material effect on the Group’s operations.

Sales commitments

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Group had a commitment to supply heating and water (in prior years also electricity) to inhabitants of Koryazhma, since the Group owns the only steam generator and electricity station in the town. The supply terms are renewed annually,  

with prices determined by the respective local state energy commissions. Management estimates that revenue and related costs from the supply of heating and water in Koryazhma for the year ending December 31, 2019 are expected to be approximately $ 4,800 and $ 4,200, respectively.

Contractual capital expenditure commitments

At December 31, 2018, the Group had outstanding contractual commitments to purchase or construct plant, properties and equipment in the amount of $ 310,640 (December 31, 2017: $ 215,789).
