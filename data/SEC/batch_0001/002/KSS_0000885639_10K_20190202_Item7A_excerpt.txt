Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

All of our long-term debt at year-end 2018 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. When our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at the existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. 

We share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the Kohlâ€™s credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. We also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables as interest rates exceed defined rates. As a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. The reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance. Recent increases in interest rates have not had a material impact on our financial results. The impact of future increases, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
