Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive Summary 

As of February 2, 2019, we operated 1,159 Kohl's department stores, a website (www.Kohls.com), 12 FILA outlets, and four Off-Aisle clearance centers. Our Kohl's stores and website sell moderately-priced proprietary and national brand apparel, footwear, accessories, beauty and home products. Our Kohl's stores generally carry a consistent merchandise assortment with some differences attributable to local preferences. Our website includes merchandise which is available in our stores, as well as merchandise that is available only online.  

Key financial results for 2018 included: 

•   

Sales increased 0.7% to $19.2 billion reflecting a 1.7% increase in our comparable sales which was partially offset by incremental sales in the 53rd week of 2017.  

•   

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points as effective inventory management contributed to fewer permanent and promotional markdowns. These increases were partially offset by higher shipping costs resulting from digital sales growth.  

•   

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a percentage of total revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by strategic technology investments.  

•   

Net income on a GAAP basis was $801 million, or $4.84 per diluted share.  

•   

On a non-GAAP basis, our net income increased 32% to $927 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 34% to $5.60.  

See "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional details about our financial results, how we define comparable sales, and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share. 

2019 Outlook 

Our current expectations for 2019 are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

This guidance includes the impact of the new lease standard which we are required to adopt in 2019 but excludes any non-recurring charges. For additional details on the lease standard, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Results of Operations 

53rd Week 

Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year. During the 53rd week, net sales were approximately $170 million; other revenue was approximately $10 million; SG&A expenses were approximately $40 million; and interest was approximately $3 million. The 53rd week increased our 2017 net income by approximately $15 million and our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10. For 2018, comparable sales compare the 52-week periods ended

Table of Contents 

February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018. For 2017, comparable sales compare the 52-week periods ended January 27, 2018 and January 28, 2017.  

Net Sales 

As an omnichannel retailer, it is often difficult to distinguish between a "store" sale and a "digital" sale. Below is a list of some omnichannel examples: 

•   

Digital customers can choose to have most online orders either shipped to their home or picked up in any of our stores. 

•   

Approximately 75% of our digital customers also shop in our stores. 

•   

Digital orders may be shipped from a dedicated E-Commerce fulfillment center, a store, a retail distribution center, third parties or any combination of the above. 

•   

Stores increase digital sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online. 

•   

Online purchases can easily be returned in our stores. 

•   

Kohl's Cash coupons and Yes2You rewards can be redeemed online or in store regardless of where they were earned. 

•   

In-store customers can order from online kiosks in our stores. 

•   

Customers who utilize our mobile app while in the store may receive mobile coupons to use when they check out. 

Because we do not have a clear distinction between "store" sales and "digital" sales, we do not report them separately. 

Kohl’s store sales are included in comparable sales after the store has been open for 12 full months. Digital sales and sales at remodeled and relocated Kohl’s stores are included in comparable sales unless square footage has changed by more than 10%.  

The following graph summarizes net sales dollars and comparable sales (Dollars in Millions): 

2018 compared to 2017 

Net sales increased $131 million, or 0.7%, to $19.2 billion for 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 1.7% increase in comparable sales mostly reflecting higher average transaction values. The increase was partially offset by $170 million of sales in the 53rd week of 2017. 

19 

Table of Contents 

By line of business, Men’s, Children’s and Footwear were the strongest categories. Home and Women’s also reported positive comparable sales. Accessories was slightly negative.  

Geographically, all regions reported higher comparable sales in 2018.  

2017 compared to 2016 

Net sales increased $400 million, or 2.1%, to $19.0 billion for 2017. Approximately $170 million of the increase was due to the 53rd week in the fiscal 2017 calendar. The remaining increase was primarily due to a 1.5% increase in comparable sales. The increase in comparable sales reflects higher average transaction values. 

By line of business, Home and Footwear were the strongest categories. Men’s also outperformed the Company average. Accessories and Children’s also reported higher comparable sales. Comparable sales trends in the Women’s business improved each quarter, but sales decreased for the year.  

Geographically, all regions reported higher comparable sales in 2017.  

Other Revenue  

Other revenue includes revenue from credit card operations, third-party advertising on our website, unused gift cards and merchandise return cards (breakage), and other non-merchandise revenue.  

The following graph summarizes other revenue (Dollars in Millions): 

Other revenue increased $14 million in 2018 and $3 million in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to higher credit card revenue, third-party advertising on our website and breakage. The increase in 2017 is due to $10 million of revenue earned in the 53rd week and higher third-party advertising on our website, partially offset by lower credit card revenue. 

Cost of Merchandise Sold and Gross Margin 

Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping expenses for digital sales; terms cash discount; and depreciation of product development facilities and equipment. Our cost of merchandise sold may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center and buying costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. 

20 

Table of Contents 

The following graph summarizes cost of merchandise sold and gross margin as a percent of net sales (Dollars in Millions): 

Gross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of merchandise sold. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased 32 basis points in 2018 and 13 basis points in 2017. The increases were driven by effective inventory management which contributed to fewer permanent and promotional markdowns, partially offset by higher shipping costs resulting from digital growth.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG&A includes compensation and benefit costs (including stores, corporate headquarters, buying and merchandising, and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; expenses from our Kohl’s credit card operations; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities; marketing expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; and other non-operating revenues and expenses. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. 

Many of our expenses, including store payroll and distribution costs, are variable in nature. These costs generally increase as sales increase and decrease as sales decrease. We measure both the change in these variable expenses and the expense as a percent of sales. If the expense as a percent of sales decreased from the prior year, the expense "leveraged". If the expense as a percent of sales increased over the prior year, the expense "deleveraged". 

The following graph summarizes the increases and (decreases) in SG&A by expense type (Dollars in Millions): 

21 

Table of Contents 

SG&A increased $100 million, or 2%, to $5.6 billion for 2018. The increase is net of approximately $40 million of incremental expense in 2017 due to the 53rd week in the fiscal 2017 calendar. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A deleveraged by 30 basis points. 

The increase in technology expenses reflects higher spend as we migrate technology systems to the cloud. Leadership changes drove the increase in corporate expenses. Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were $312 million for 2018 and increased $9 million due to higher transportation costs. Marketing costs reflect higher digital and personalization spend. In our stores, increases in expenses driven by omnichannel support of ship-from-store and buy online, pick-up in store operations were offset by productivity improvements. Expenses from our credit card operations decreased due to savings in payroll and operating costs.  

The following graph summarizes the increases and (decreases) in SG&A by expense type (Dollars in Millions): 

SG&A increased $71 million, or 1%, to $5.5 billion for 2017. Approximately $40 million of the increase was due to the 53rd week in the fiscal 2017 calendar. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A leveraged by 20 basis points.  

The increase in corporate expenses was driven by higher incentive compensation as a result of our strong financial performance in 2017. The increase in technology expenses reflects higher costs as we migrate to the cloud. Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were $303 million for 2017. The increase of $23 million was due to growth in digital sales and the opening of our fifth E-Commerce facility. In our stores, decreases in controllable expenses were substantially offset by higher store payroll due to on-going wage pressure and omnichannel support of ship-from-store and buy online, pick-up in store operations. Expenses from our credit card operations decreased due to lower operating costs. Marketing costs reflect efficiencies in our non-customer facing spend and the benefit of not repeating a non-productive marketing event.  

Other Expenses 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

22 

Table of Contents 

The changes in depreciation and amortization reflect the net impact of lower depreciation due to maturing of our stores, higher amortization due to investments in technology, higher depreciation from our fifth E-Commerce fulfillment center which opened in 2017, and a $22 million write-off in 2017 of information technology projects that no longer fit into our strategic and cloud migration plans. 

The decrease in interest expense in 2018 was driven by the benefits of debt reductions in 2018. Higher interest income due to higher yields and investment balances and lower interest on capital leases as the portfolio matures also contributed to the decreases in both periods. 

Impairments, store closing and other costs include the following expenses related to closing four stores, consolidating call center locations which support both Kohl’s charge and online customers, a voluntary retirement program, and the impairment of certain assets in 2018. In 2016, the costs related to closing 18 stores and the organizational realignment at our corporate office: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loss on the extinguishment of debt of $63 million in 2018 resulted from a $413 million make whole call and a $500 million cash tender offer in 2018.  

Income Taxes 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, originally the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include a corporate rate decrease from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, as well as a variety of other changes including the acceleration of expensing of certain business assets and reductions in the amount of executive pay that could qualify as a tax deduction.  

Our effective tax rate in 2018 includes the full year benefit of the decrease in the corporate rate. For 2017, the reduction in the tax rate was prorated, resulting in a statutory federal tax rate of 33.7%. In 2017, we recorded a total tax benefit of $136 million related to the federal tax rate reduction and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as a $20 million benefit from the settlement of a significant state tax dispute. These items reduced our 2017 effective tax rate by 10.9 percentage points.

Adjusted Net Income and Earnings per Diluted Share 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We believe adjusted results are useful because they provide enhanced visibility into our results for the periods excluding the impact of unique items such as those included in the table above. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace GAAP measures. 

Inflation 

We expect that our operations will continue to be influenced by general economic conditions, including food, fuel and energy prices, higher wages and by costs to source our merchandise. There can be no assurance that our business will not be impacted by such factors in the future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following table presents our primary cash requirements and sources of funds.

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operations increased $416 million to $2.1 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in accounts payable and other operating assets and liabilities. 

Net cash provided by operations decreased $462 million to $1.7 billion in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in accounts payable. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $77 million to $572 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of technology spending. 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $107 million to $649 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the beauty rollout, corporate improvements, and new stores in 2016. 

The following chart summarizes capital expenditures by major category: 

We expect total capital expenditures of approximately $850 million in fiscal 2019. The increase is driven by omnichannel investments as we construct our sixth E-commerce fulfillment center. The total actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on store strategies; construction of and renovations to distribution centers; mix of owned, leased or acquired stores; and technology and corporate spending. We do not anticipate that our capital expenditures will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities increased $1.1 billion to $1.9 billion in 2018, primarily due to $943 million of debt reductions during the year. 

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $222 million to $808 million in 2017, primarily due to a $251 million decrease in treasury stock purchases. Share repurchases are discretionary in nature. The timing and amount of repurchases are based upon available cash balances, our stock price and other factors. 

We may again seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved could be material.

As of February 2, 2019, our credit ratings were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2018, we paid cash dividends of $400 million as detailed in the following table:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

On February 27, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.67 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend. The dividend is payable April 3, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 20, 2019.  

Free Cash Flow 

We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow for 2018; an increase of $522 million, or 59%, over 2017. As discussed above, the increase is primarily the result of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less capital expenditures and capital lease and financing obligation payments. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. See the key financial ratio calculations section below. 

Liquidity Ratios 

The following table provides additional measures of our liquidity: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Liquidity measures our ability to meet short-term cash needs. Working capital decreased $566 million and our current ratio decreased 22 basis points over year-end 2017 primarily due to lower cash balances as a result of debt reductions.

Table of Contents 

We believe that ROI is a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance. When analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared with the return on assets, it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period. ROI is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) divided by average gross investment. Our ROI calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. ROI should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as return on assets. See the key financial ratio calculations below for our ROI and ROA and ROI excluding non-recurring items calculations. 

Capital Structure Ratios 

The following table provides additional measures of our capital structure: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Non-GAAP financial measure 

The decreases in our capital structure ratios are primarily due to debt reductions in 2018. 

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as our adjusted outstanding debt balance divided by adjusted EBITDAR. We believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our current goals are to maintain a ratio that demonstrates our commitment to an investment grade rating and allows us to operate with an efficient capital structure for our size, growth plans and industry. Our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR calculation may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as debt/capitalization. See the key financial ratio calculations section below for our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR calculation. 

Our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and a maximum permitted debt ratio. As of February 2, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during 2019. See the key financial ratio calculations section below for our debt covenant calculation.

Contractual Obligations 

Our contractual obligations as of February 2, 2019 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Our leases typically require that we pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $183 million for 2018, $184 million for 2017, and $179 million for 2016. The lease term includes cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty.  

(b)  

Other includes royalties, legally binding minimum lease and interest payments for stores opening in 2019 or later, as well as payments associated with technology and marketing agreements.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year-end 2018. 

We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital resources.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2018 Form 10-K. 

Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation 

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (“RIM”). Under RIM, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. We would record an additional reserve if the future estimated selling price is less than cost. 

RIM inherently requires management judgment and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well  

30 

Table of Contents 

as gross margin. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion trends and weather conditions. 

Inventory shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period between the last physical inventory count and the balance sheet date. Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. We perform an annual physical inventory count at the majority of our stores and distribution centers. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. 

Vendor Allowances 

We frequently receive allowances from our vendors for discounts that we have taken in order to sell the vendor’s merchandise and/or to support gross margins earned on those sales. This markdown support generally relates to sold inventory or permanent markdowns and, accordingly, is reflected as a reduction to cost of merchandise sold. Markdown support related to merchandise that has not yet been sold is recorded in inventory. 

We also receive support from vendors for marketing and other costs that we have incurred to sell the vendors’ merchandise. To the extent the reimbursements are for specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor's products and do not exceed the costs incurred, they are recognized as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative expenses. If these criteria are not met, the support is recorded in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold. 

Insurance Reserve Estimates 

We are primarily self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. We use a third-party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. The actuary considers historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors, health care trends, and actuarial assumptions to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store or significant operating losses, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. 

If our evaluations, which are performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. 

Identifying impaired assets and quantifying the related impairment loss, if any, requires significant estimates by management. The most significant of these estimates is the cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store, management estimates future store performance including sales, gross margin, and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense. Projected cash flows must be estimated for future periods throughout the remaining life of the property, which may be as many as 40 years in the future. The accuracy of these estimates will be impacted by a number of factors including general economic conditions, changes in competitive landscape and our ability to effectively manage the operations of the store. 

Other than stores which we have closed and the trademark that was impaired in the fourth quarter of 2018, we have not historically experienced any significant impairment of long-lived assets. Additionally, impairment of an  

31 

Table of Contents 

individual building and related improvements, net of accumulated depreciation, would not generally be material to our financial results. 

Store Closure Reserve 

In 2016, we closed numerous leased stores prior to their scheduled lease expiration. In addition to future rent obligations, the closed store reserve includes estimates for operating and other expenses expected to be incurred over the remaining lease term, some of which extend through January 2030. 

Income Taxes 

We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available to us. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. 

Unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred tax assets, tax reserves or income tax expense. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. 

Leases 

Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as a capital or operating lease. 

If we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or the lease is considered a capital lease, we record the property and related financing or capital lease obligation on our balance sheet. The asset is then depreciated over its expected lease term. Rent payments for these properties are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the financing or capital lease obligation. 

If the lease is considered an operating lease, it is not recorded on our balance sheet and rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 

The most significant estimates used by management in accounting for property leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows: 

•   

Expected lease term—Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased asset’s useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset or the straight-line rent recognition period. Increasing the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher rent expense for an operating lease and higher interest and depreciation expenses for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet. 

•   

Incremental borrowing rate—We estimate our incremental borrowing rate using treasury rates for debt with maturities comparable to the expected lease term plus our credit spread. The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the  

32 

Table of Contents 

fair market value of the property. Increasing the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. For leases which are recorded on our balance sheet with a related capital lease or financing obligation, the incremental borrowing rate, subject to certain limitations, is also used in allocating our rental payments between interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding obligation. 

•   

Fair market value of leased asset—The fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party appraisers or consideration received from the landlord. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the fair market value reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. Fair market value is also used in determining the amount of property and related financing obligation to be recognized on our balance sheet for certain leased properties which are considered owned for accounting purposes.
