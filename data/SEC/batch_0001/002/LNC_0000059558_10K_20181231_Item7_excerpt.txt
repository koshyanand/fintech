Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 ﻿  

 The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the financial condition as of December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017, and the results of operations in 2018 and 2017, compared with the immediately preceding year of Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, “LNC,” “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to Lincoln National Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. On May 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston (“Liberty Life” or “LLACB”). Beginning on May 1, 2018, the results of operations and financial condition of Liberty Life were consolidated with LNC. Accordingly, all financial information presented herein for the year ended December 31, 2018, includes the accounts of LNC and the accounts of Liberty Life since May 1, 2018.   

 ﻿  

 The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” above.   

 ﻿  

 In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 for a discussion of GAAP.  

 ﻿  

 Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 21. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.  

 ﻿  

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE  

 ﻿  

 Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).

   ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products; a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products; an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”); and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products; 

   ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates; 

   ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;  

   ·    Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income; 

   ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition; 

   ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity; 

   ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments; 

   ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others; 

   ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems; 

   ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including the successful implementation of integration strategies or the achievement of anticipated synergies and operational efficiencies related to an acquisition; 

   ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased; 

   ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance; 

   ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products; 

   ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from evolving market preferences and the changing demographics of our client base; and 

   ·    The unanticipated loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers. 

 ﻿  

 The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance, including “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which are incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   

 ﻿  

 Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.

 INTRODUCTION  

 ﻿  

 Executive Summary   

 ﻿  

 We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products primarily include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.  

 ﻿  

 We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” above. As discussed in Note 3, on May 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Liberty Life, which operates a group benefits business and individual life and individual and group annuity business, in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. We ceded insurance policies relating to the individual life and individual and group annuity business to third-party reinsurers. The operating results of Liberty Life are included in our Group Protection segment beginning on May 1, 2018. The acquisition enables us to increase our market share within the group protection marketplace.   

 38  

We provide information about our segments’ and Other Operations’ operating revenue and expense line items and realized gain (loss), key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items below. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   

 ﻿  

 Industry Trends  

 ﻿  

 We continue to be influenced by a variety of trends that affect the industry.   

 ﻿  

 Financial and Economic Environment  

 ﻿  

 The level of long-term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a negative effect on the demand for and the profitability of spread-based products such as fixed annuities and UL. Low long-term rates can also increase the cost of providing variable annuity living benefit guarantees. A flat or inverted yield curve and low long-term interest rates are affecting new money rates on corporate bonds. Equity market performance can also affect the profitability of life insurers, as product demand and fee income from variable annuities and fee income from pension products tied to separate account balances often reflect equity market performance. Insurance premium growth, with respect to group life and disability products, for example, is closely tied to employers’ total payroll growth. Additionally, the potential market for these products is expanded by new business creation.   

 ﻿  

 The Federal Reserve’s forecast for 2019, as reported in December of 2018, indicated that economic activity will grow at an approximate rate of 2.3% over the next year, labor market indicators will remain strong and inflation will be near its target of 2%. Driven by continued improvements in the labor market and inflation market conditions, the Federal Reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points four times during 2018 to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%. The Federal Reserve will monitor economic data closely to determine its next steps to changes in monetary policy.   

 Regulatory Environment  

 ﻿  

 U.S.-domiciled insurance entities are regulated at the state level, while certain products and services are also subject to federal regulation. Regulators may refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially affect the capital requirements and profitability of the industry and result in increased regulation and oversight for the industry. For example, on April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed “Regulation Best Interest,” including a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction, without putting its financial interests ahead of the interests of a retail customer. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Federal Regulation – Regulations relating to the standard of care applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers could result in additional disclosure and other requirements related to the sale and delivery of our products and services” and “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory” for a discussion of the potential effects of regulatory changes on our industry.  

 ﻿  

 Demographics  

 ﻿  

 Escalation of income protection and wealth accumulation goals for baby-boomers nearing retirement is a key driver shaping the actions of the insurance industry. As a result of increasing longevity, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that may span 30 or more years. Helping the baby-boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income represents an opportunity for the insurance industry. Another opportunity for the insurance industry is the need for long-term care services as retirees are living longer and will need these services at some point in their lifetime.   

 ﻿  

 Millennials entering the insurance market is another key driver shaping the actions of the insurance industry. This demographic group could end up having different consumer preferences than our in-force business. These shifts may be tied to the type of products they purchase and how they choose to purchase these products.  

 ﻿  

 The insurance industry’s products, and the needs they are designed to address, are complex. We believe that individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements. In the workplace, as employees take greater responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning, they will need information about their possible individual needs. One of the challenges for the insurance industry will be the delivery of this information in a cost effective manner.  

 ﻿  

 Competitive Environment  

 ﻿  

 See the “Competition” sections for each of our segments in “Part 1 – Business – Business Segments and Other Operations” for discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate.  

 ﻿  

 39  

Significant Operational Matters   

 ﻿  

 Strategic Digitization Initiative   

 ﻿  

 We continue to make strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues, further spur productivity and improve our efficiency and service to our customers. These efforts include an enterprise-wide digitization initiative that intends to significantly enhance our customer experience and provide operational efficiencies over time to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. We expect such efforts to have a net neutral impact during 2019 and ultimately see annual benefits beyond 2020 of approximately $90 million to $150 million, pre-tax, as a result of this initiative.  

 ﻿  

 Targeted Annual Operating Earnings Per Share Growth  

 ﻿  

 Growth in operating earnings per share (“EPS”) is a key driver of our long-term performance. We believe that the key drivers to growing our operating EPS over time include:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Generating positive net flows through our product development and distribution; 

   ·    Capital markets performing in-line with our expectations; 

   ·    Expense discipline, our strategic digitization initiative and expense synergies of acquired businesses driving improvement in operating margins; and 

   ·    Capital generation and active capital deployment, consisting of returning capital to common stockholders. 

 ﻿  

 Sources of Earnings  

 ﻿  

 We monitor our sources of earnings as a factor in managing our businesses. This information may be useful in assessing our risk profile and cost of capital. We continue to focus on achieving our long-term goal of increasing mortality and morbidity margins. Growth in this source of earnings component could be driven by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, pricing actions on our life and group products and acquiring blocks of mortality/morbidity business. The following table presents the sources of earnings components of income (loss) from operations, before income taxes, excluding Other Operations:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Investment spread earnings consist primarily of net investment income, net of interest credited, earned on the underlying general account investments supporting our fixed products less related expenses. 

   (2)    Mortality/morbidity earnings result from mortality margins, morbidity margins, and certain expense assessments and related fees that are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of business in force.  

   (3)    Fees on assets under management (“AUM”) earnings consist primarily of asset-based fees charged on variable account values less associated benefits and related expenses. 

   (4)    Variable annuity (“VA”) riders’ earnings consist of fees charged to the contract holder related to guaranteed benefit rider features, less the net valuation premium and associated change in benefit reserves and related expenses. 

 ﻿  

 See Note 21 for additional information on income (loss) from operations by segment.   

 ﻿  

 Interest Rate Risk  

 ﻿  

 Because the profitability of our business depends in part on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability. Changes in interest rates may impact both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital. Thus, low interest rates negatively impact margins while rapidly rising interest rates can result in increased surrenders. Gradually rising interest rates are likely to be beneficial to our profitability. Some of our products, principally our fixed annuities and UL, including IUL and linked-benefit UL, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates or prolonged low interest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the interest that we are required to credit to contracts and the yields that we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting our obligations under the contracts.   

 ﻿  

 Although we have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment, declines in our spread, or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products, could have an adverse effect on some of our businesses or results of operations. We have provided disclosures around interest rate spreads and interest rate risk in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads   

 40  

to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”  

 ﻿  

 Variable Annuity Hedge Program Performance  

 ﻿  

 We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) embedded derivatives and benefit ratio unlocking in certain of our variable annuity products. The income statement effect due to the change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in embedded derivative reserves and benefit ratio unlocking. We also use derivative instruments to hedge the income statement effect in the opposite direction of the GLB benefit ratio unlocking for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from the Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments’ operating revenues and income (loss) from operations (see Note 21). See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below for information on our methodology for calculating the non-performance risk (“NPR”), which affects the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserves.  

 ﻿  

 We also offer variable annuity products with death benefit guarantees. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – GDB,” we use derivative instruments to hedge the income statement effect of the guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) benefit ratio unlocking for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations (see Note 21).  

 ﻿  

 The costs of derivative instruments that we use to hedge these variable annuity products may increase as a result of a low interest rate environment.  

 ﻿  

 Earnings from Account Values  

 ﻿  

 The Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments are the most sensitive to the equity markets, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Life Insurance segment. We discuss the earnings effect of the equity markets on account values and the related asset-based earnings below in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity.”   

 ﻿  

 Effective Tax Rates Resulting from the Tax Act  

 ﻿  

 As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), we remeasured our existing deferred tax balances using the 21% marginal corporate income tax rate and recognized a $1.3 billion benefit in federal income tax expense (benefit) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2017, as we were in a net deferred tax liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net income benefited from the lower corporate income tax rate, and we estimate the following effective tax rates over the near term: 15%-17% for our consolidated operations, 14%-16% for Annuities, 15%-17% for Retirement Plan Services, 19%-21% for Life Insurance and 21% for Group Protection.  

 ﻿  

 Issues and Outlook  

 ﻿  

 Going into 2019, significant issues include:  

   ·    Ongoing actions by government and regulatory authorities to introduce regulations or change existing regulations or guidance and any implementation of such actions, in a manner that could have a significant effect on our capital, earnings and/or business models; 

   ·    Evolving market trends that have impacted sales of our various products;  

   ·    Volatility in the capital markets that could include changes in equity markets and interest rates and/or adverse credit market conditions; and 

   ·    Successful integration of any acquired businesses, including driving expense synergies. 

 ﻿  

 In the face of these issues, we expect to focus on the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Continuing to make investments in our businesses, primarily in technology/digitization (including integrating and consolidating systems and processes), product innovation and distribution, to grow revenues, drive margin expansion and reduce costs;  

   ·    Utilizing our product development and distribution resources to help us respond to evolving trends and regulatory changes and to shift our new business mix to focus on products in line with our long-term growth strategies; 

   ·    Closely monitoring ongoing activities in the legal and regulatory environment and taking an active role in the legislative and/or regulatory process;  

   ·    Closely monitoring our capital and liquidity positions taking into account changing economic conditions and monetary policy, ongoing regulatory activities regarding statutory reserves, including the continued adoption of principles-based reserving, and captive structures, and our capital deployment strategy; 

   ·    Continuing to explore additional financing strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain related to our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees in order to manage our capital position effectively; 

   ·    Maintaining the flexibility to adjust the risk profile of assets within our investment portfolio; and 

   ·   

 Managing our expenses aggressively through our strategic digitization initiative and expense synergies of acquired businesses   

 41  

combined with continued financial discipline and execution excellence throughout our operations. 

 ﻿  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 ﻿  

 We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the understanding of our results of operations and our financial condition. In applying these critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements, management must use critical assumptions, estimates and judgments concerning future results or other developments, including the likelihood, timing or amount of one or more future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our assumptions, estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. For a detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies, see Note 1.  

 ﻿  

 DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL  

 ﻿  

 Accounting for intangible assets requires numerous assumptions, such as estimates of expected future profitability for our operations and our ability to retain existing blocks of life and annuity business in force. Our accounting policies for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL affect the Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments.   

 ﻿  

 Deferrals  

 ﻿  

 Qualifying deferrable acquisition expenses are recorded as an asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as DAC for products we sold during a period or VOBA for books of business we acquired during a period. In addition, we defer costs associated with DSI and revenues associated with DFEL. DSI increases interest credited and reduces income when amortized. DFEL is a liability included within other contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and when amortized, increases fee income on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).   

 ﻿  

 We incur certain costs that can be capitalized in the acquisition of insurance contracts. Only those costs incurred that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts may be capitalized as deferrable acquisition costs. This determination of deferability must be made on a contract-level basis. Some examples of acquisition costs that are subject to deferral include the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Employee, agent or broker commissions; 

   ·    Wholesaler production bonuses; 

   ·    Renewal commissions and bonuses to agents or brokers; 

   ·    Medical and inspection fees;  

   ·    Premium-related taxes and assessments; and 

   ·    A portion of the salaries and benefits of certain employees involved in the underwriting, contract issuance and processing, medical and inspection and sales force contract selling functions. 

 ﻿  

 All other acquisition-related costs, including costs incurred by the insurer for soliciting potential customers, market research, training, administration, management of distribution and underwriting functions, unsuccessful acquisition or renewal efforts and product development, are considered non-deferrable acquisition costs and must be expensed in the period incurred.   

 ﻿  

 In addition, the following indirect costs are considered non-deferrable acquisition costs and must be charged to expense in the period incurred:   

 ﻿  

   ·    Administrative costs; 

   ·    Rent; 

   ·    Depreciation; 

   ·    Occupancy costs; 

   ·    Equipment costs (including data processing equipment dedicated to acquiring insurance contracts); 

   ·    Trail commissions; and 

   ·    Other general overhead. 

 ﻿  

 42  

Our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL balances (in millions) by business segment as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Fixed maturity available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities and certain derivatives are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”), net of associated DAC, VOBA, DSI, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. The unrealized balances in the table above represent the DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL balances for these effects of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity AFS securities and certain derivatives.  

 ﻿  

 Amortization  

 ﻿  

 DAC for variable annuity and deferred fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies is amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to the incidence of EGPs derived from the contracts. Certain broker commissions or broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales of mutual fund products, respectively, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. For our traditional products, we amortize deferrable acquisition costs either on a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.   

 ﻿  

 EGPs vary based on a number of sources including policy persistency, mortality, fee income, investment margins, expense margins and realized gains and losses on investments, including assumptions about the expected level of credit-related losses. Each of these sources of profit is, in turn, driven by other factors. For example, assets under management and the spread between earned and credited rates drive investment margins; net amount at risk drives the level of cost of insurance charges and reinsurance premiums. The level of separate account assets under management is driven by changes in the financial markets (equity and bond markets, hereafter referred to collectively as “equity markets”) and net flows. Realized gains and losses on investments include amounts resulting from differences in the actual level of impairments and the levels assumed in calculating EGPs.  

 ﻿  

 We generally amortize DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL in proportion to our EGPs for interest-sensitive products. When actual gross profits are higher in the period than EGPs, we recognize more amortization than planned. When actual gross profits are lower in the period than EGPs, we recognize less amortization than planned. In a calendar year where the gross profits for a certain group of policies, or “cohorts,” are negative, our actuarial process limits, or floors, the amortization expense offset to zero. For a discussion of the periods over which we amortize our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL see “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1.  

 ﻿  

 Unlocking  

 ﻿  

 As discussed and defined in “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products in the third quarter of each year. We may have unlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating assumptions outside of our annual comprehensive review.   

 ﻿  

 43  

For illustrative purposes, the following generally presents the hypothetical effects to net income (loss) attributable to changes in certain assumptions from those our model projections assume, assuming all other factors remain constant:   

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Details underlying the effect to net income (loss) from unlocking (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Unlocking was driven primarily by the following:  

 ﻿  

 2018  

 ﻿  

   ·    For Annuities, favorable unlocking was driven by updates to our capital markets and policyholder behavior assumptions and other items, partially offset by unfavorable updates to our interest rate assumptions.  

   ·    For Retirement Plan Services, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to our interest rate and maintenance expense assumptions, partially offset by favorable updates to our policyholder behavior assumptions and other items. 

   ·    For Life Insurance, unfavorable unlocking was driven by updates to our mortality margin and reinsurance assumptions and other items, partially offset by favorable updates to our investment allocation and performance, morbidity and policyholder behavior assumptions. 

   ·    For excluded realized gain (loss), favorable unlocking was driven by updates to our policyholder behavior and capital markets assumptions and other items, partially offset by unfavorable updates to our separate account fees assumptions.  

 ﻿  

 2017  

 ﻿  

   ·    For Annuities, favorable unlocking was driven by updates to our policyholder behavior and separate account fees assumptions and other items, partially offset by unfavorable updates to our interest rate assumptions.

 Reversion to the Mean  

 ﻿  

 Because returns within the variable sub-accounts (“variable funds”) have a significant effect on the value of variable annuity and VUL products and the fees earned on these accounts, EGPs could increase or decrease with movements in variable fund returns; therefore, significant and sustained changes in variable funds have had and could in the future have an effect on DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) and VUL businesses.   

 ﻿  

 As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process. Under our RTM process, on each valuation date, future EGPs are projected using stochastic modeling of a large number of market scenarios in conjunction with best estimates of lapse rates, interest rate spreads and mortality to develop a statistical distribution of the present value of future EGPs for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) and VUL blocks of business. Because variable fund returns are unpredictable, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate projections of future EGPs need not be affected by random short-term and insignificant deviations from expectations in variable fund returns. However, long-term or significant deviations from expected variable fund returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits. The statistical distribution is designed to identify when the deviations from expected returns have become significant enough to warrant a change of the future variable fund growth rate assumption.   

 ﻿  

 The stochastic modeling performed for our variable annuity blocks of business as described above is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future EGPs. We compare the range of the present value of the future EGPs from the stochastic modeling to that used in our amortization model. A set of intervals around the mean of these scenarios is utilized to calculate two separate statistical ranges of reasonably possible EGPs. These intervals are then compared to the present value of the EGPs used in the amortization model. If the present value of EGPs utilized for amortization were to exceed the reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the EGPs used to calculate amortization would be considered. If a revision is deemed necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values at the end of the period during which the revision occurred along with a long-term variable fund growth rate assumption such that the re-projected EGPs would be our best estimate of EGPs.  

 ﻿  

 Our practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the first of the two statistical ranges, but, rather, if we stay between the first and second statistical range for several quarters, we would likely unlock. Additionally, if we exceed the ranges as a result of a short-term market reaction, we would not necessarily unlock. However, if the second statistical range is exceeded for more than one quarter, it is likely that we would unlock. While this approach reduces adjustments to DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL due to short-term fluctuations, significant changes in variable fund returns that extend beyond one or two quarters could result in a significant favorable or unfavorable unlocking. Notwithstanding these intervals, if a severe decline or increase in variable fund values were to occur or should other circumstances suggest that the present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we could determine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary.  

 ﻿  

 Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate increase of approximately 1% followed by growth going forward of 6.5% to 8.25% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed-income and equity-type investments. If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of December 31, 2018, we would have recorded an unfavorable unlocking of approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for Annuities and a favorable unlocking of approximately $70 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance and approximately $10 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services.

 Investments  

 ﻿  

 Invested assets are an integral part of our operations, and we invest in fixed maturity securities that are primarily classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost included in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. We also invest in equity securities that are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in realized gain (loss). See “Consolidated Investments” below for more information.   

 ﻿  

 Investment Valuation   

 ﻿  

 Our measurement of fair value is based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset or NPR, which would include our own credit risk. Our estimate of an exchange   

 45  

price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability (“exit price”) in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that asset or liability, as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or receive a liability (“entry price”). We categorize our financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of inputs to the respective valuation technique. The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined in Note 1.   

 ﻿  

 The following summarizes our investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of December 31, 2018:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.  

 ﻿  

 For the categories and associated fair value of our fixed maturity AFS securities classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, see Notes 1 and 20.   

 ﻿  

 Our investments are valued using the appropriate market inputs based on the investment type, and include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. In addition, market indicators and industry and economic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met. We incorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted, given the issuer’s industry and the security’s time to maturity. We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we do not adjust prices received from third parties or obtain multiple prices when measuring the fair value of our investments. We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes because we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs they use, as compared to the limited information on the pricing inputs from broker quotes. For private placement securities, we use pricing matrices that utilize observable pricing inputs of similar public securities and Treasury yields as inputs to the fair value measurement. It is possible that different valuation techniques and models, other than those described above, could produce materially different estimates of fair value.   

 ﻿  

 When the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability, we believe that the market is not active. Activities that may indicate a market is not active include fewer recent transactions in the market, price quotations that lack current information and/or vary substantially over time or among market makers, limited public information, uncorrelated indexes with recent fair values of assets and abnormally wide bid-ask spread. As of December 31, 2018, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.  

 ﻿  

 We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2018, we used broker quotes for 38 securities as our final price source, representing less than 1% of total securities owned.   

 ﻿  

 In order to validate the pricing information and broker quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales and observations of general market movements for those security classes. Our primary third-party pricing service has policies and processes to ensure that it is using objectively verifiable observable market data. The pricing service regularly reviews the evaluation inputs for securities covered, including broker quotes, executed trades and credit information, as applicable. If the pricing service determines it does not have sufficient objectively verifiable information about a security’s valuation, it discontinues providing a valuation for the security. The pricing service regularly publishes and updates a summary of inputs used in its valuations by major security type. In addition, we have policies and procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by the third-party pricing service and the output that is provided to us by the pricing service. On a periodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used by the pricing service, and we perform a comparison of the pricing service output to an alternative pricing source. In addition, we check prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they   

 46  

are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for unusual changes from period to period based on certain parameters or for lack of change from one period to the next. If such anomalies in the pricing are observed, we may use pricing information from another pricing source.   

 ﻿  

 Valuation of Alternative Investments  

 ﻿  

 Recognition of investment income on alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial statements, which are generally obtained from the partnerships’ general partners, as our venture capital, real estate and oil and gas portfolios are generally reported to us on a three-month delay, and our hedge funds are reported to us on a one-month delay. In addition, the effect of annual audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees are typically received during the first or second quarter of each calendar year. Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar year period may not include the complete effect of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year period. Recorded audit adjustments affect our investment income on alternative investments in the period that the adjustments are recorded.   

 ﻿  

 Write-Downs for OTTI and Valuation Allowances  

 ﻿  

 We regularly review our fixed maturity AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be other-than-temporary. For additional details, see “Consolidated Investments” below and Notes 1 and 5.  

 ﻿  

 For certain securitized fixed maturity securities with contractual cash flows, including asset-backed securities (“ABS”), we use our best estimate of cash flows for the life of the security to determine whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) of the security. In addition, we review for other indicators of impairment as required by the Investments – Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (“ASC”).  

 ﻿  

 As the discussion in Notes 1 and 5 indicates, there are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other-than-temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in general overall economic conditions, as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, future financial market effects such as interest rate spreads, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, there are often significant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair values of securities as described in “Investment Valuation.” We continually monitor developments and update underlying assumptions and financial models based upon new information.   

 Write-downs and valuation allowances on commercial mortgage loans, real estate and other investments are established when the underlying value of the property is deemed to be less than the carrying value. All commercial mortgage loans that are impaired have an established valuation allowance. Changing economic conditions affect our valuation of commercial mortgage loans. Increasing vacancies, declining rents and the like are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase in) a valuation allowance. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis include properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt-service coverage and/or loan-to-value reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased our valuation allowance based upon this analysis.   

 ﻿  

 We have also established a valuation allowance on our residential mortgage loan portfolio that includes a specific valuation allowance for loans that are deemed to be impaired as well as a general valuation allowance for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property risk or market specific risk has not been identified but for which we anticipate a loss has occurred. The general valuation allowance on our residential mortgage loan portfolio is based on loss history adjusted for current conditions.   

 ﻿  

 Derivatives   

 ﻿  

 We maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” Notes 1 and 6.   

 ﻿  

 We carry our derivative instruments at fair value, which we determine through valuation techniques or models that use market data inputs or independent broker quotations. The fair values fluctuate from period to period due to the volatility of the valuation inputs, including but not limited to swap interest rates, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and correlations, some of which are significantly affected by economic conditions. The effect to revenue is reported in realized gain (loss) and such amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income (loss) from operations of our segments.   

 ﻿  

 Certain of our variable annuity contracts reported within future contract benefits contain embedded derivatives that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are all classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, including our GLB reserves embedded derivatives, a portion of which may be reported in either other assets or other liabilities. These embedded derivatives are valued based on a stochastic projection of scenarios of the embedded derivative cash flows. The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include assumptions for capital markets, actuarial lapse, benefit utilization, mortality,   

 47  

risk margin, administrative expenses and a margin for profit. In addition, an NPR component is determined at each valuation date that reflects our risk of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying liability. The spread for the NPR is added to the discount rates used in determining the fair value from the net cash flows. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. Changes in the fair value of these embedded derivatives result primarily from changes in market conditions. For more information, see Notes 1 and 20.  

 ﻿  

 GLB  

 ﻿  

 We have a dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities associated with the Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature and our i4LIFE® Advantage and 4LATER® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features that are available in our variable annuity products. We have certain GLB variable annuity products with GWB and GIB features that are embedded derivatives. Certain features of these guarantees, notably our GIB, 4LATER®, Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage and Lincoln Market SelectSM Advantage features, have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC (“benefit reserves”) and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits.  

 ﻿  

 Changes in the value of the hedge contracts hedge the income statement effect of changes in GLB embedded derivative reserves and benefit reserves. This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options and total return swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, and futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices, as well as interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency futures. The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and GLB benefit reserves caused by changes in equity markets, as well as the change in GLB embedded derivative reserves caused by changes in interest rates and implied volatilities. See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below for information on how we determine our NPR.  

 ﻿  

 As part of our current hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market-implied volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, these positions may not completely offset changes in the fair value of embedded derivative reserves and benefit reserves caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities, realized market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off.   

 ﻿  

 Within our individual annuity business, 64% and 65% of our variable annuity account values contained GLB features as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features. A contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 27% and 5%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $1.3 billion and $342 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.  

 ﻿  

 As a result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GLB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance. Our fair value estimates of the GLB embedded derivatives, which are based on detailed models of future cash flows under a wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reflect a more comprehensive view of the related factors and represent our best estimate of the present value of these potential liabilities. The market-consistent scenarios used in the determination of the fair value of the GLB embedded derivatives are similar to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid. We use risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations in our calculation to value the entire block of guarantees, which involve 100 unique scenarios per policy or approximately 49 million scenarios. The market-consistent scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant. The market-consistent inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions for capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, rider utilization, etc.), mortality, risk margins, maintenance expenses and a margin for profit. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.

The following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income (loss) that could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities (in millions) at the levels indicated in the table and excludes the net cost of operating the hedging program. The amounts represent the estimated difference between the change in the portion of GLB reserves that is calculated on a fair value basis and the change in the value of the underlying hedge instruments after the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and taxes. These effects do not include any estimate of unlocking that could occur, nor do they estimate any change in the NPR component of the GLB reserve or any estimate of effects to our GLB benefit ratio unlocking. These estimates are based upon the recorded reserves as of December 31, 2018, and the related hedge instruments in place as of that date. The effects presented in the table below are not representative of the aggregate impacts that could result if a combination of such changes to equity market returns, interest rates and implied volatilities occurred.

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The actual effects of the results illustrated in the two tables above could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control, and consideration should be given to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    The analysis is only valid as of December 31, 2018, due to changing market conditions, contract holder activity, hedge positions and other factors; 

   ·    The analysis assumes instantaneous shifts in the capital market factors and no ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market changes; 

   ·    The analysis assumes constant exchange rates and implied dividend yields; 

   ·    Assumptions regarding shifts in the market factors, such as assuming parallel shifts in interest rate and implied volatility term structures, may be overly simplistic and not indicative of actual market behavior in stress scenarios; 

   ·    It is very unlikely that one capital market sector (e.g., equity markets) will sustain such a large instantaneous movement without affecting other capital market sectors; and 

   ·    The analysis assumes that there is no tracking or basis risk between the funds and/or indices affecting the GLB reserves and the instruments utilized to hedge these exposures.  

 ﻿  

 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index® Benefits  

 ﻿  

 Our indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect a fixed interest rate return or a return where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”). Contract holders may elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at renewal dates, either annually or biannually. At the end of each 1-year or 2-year indexed term, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing different participation rates, caps, spreads or specified rates, subject to contractual guarantees. We purchase S&P 500 options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period. The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the change in value of the embedded derivative within the indexed annuity, both of which are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC require that we calculate fair values of index options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations in future reset periods. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates. Changes in the fair values of these liabilities are included as a component of realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). For information on our S&P 500 benefits hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.

Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations   

 ﻿  

 Reserves  

 ﻿  

 Reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. Establishing adequate reserves for our obligations to contract holders requires assumptions to be made regarding mortality and morbidity. The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding contracts. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.  

 ﻿  

 The reserves reported in our consolidated financial statements contained herein are calculated in accordance with GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance subsidiaries. These differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables, interest, persistency and other assumptions that we believe to be more representative of the expected experience for these contracts than those required for statutory accounting purposes and from differences in actuarial reserving methods.   

 ﻿  

 The assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required. This would result in a charge to our net income during the period the increase in reserves occurred. The key experience assumptions include mortality rates, policy persistency and interest rates. We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.  

 ﻿  

 GDB  

 ﻿  

 The reserves related to the GDB features available in our variable annuity products are based on the application of a “benefit ratio” (the present value of total expected benefit payments over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract) to total variable annuity assessments received in the period. The level and direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the variable annuity.   

 ﻿  

 We utilize a delta hedging strategy for variable annuity products with a GDB feature, which uses futures on U.S.-based equity market indices to hedge against movements in equity markets. The hedging strategy is designed to hedge our exposure to earnings volatility that results from equity market driven changes in the reserve for GDB contracts. Because the GDB reserves are based upon projected long-term equity market return assumptions, and because the value of the hedging contracts will reflect current capital market conditions, the quarterly changes in values for the GDB reserves and the hedging contracts may not exactly offset each other. For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.   

 ﻿  

 UL Products with Secondary Guarantees  

 ﻿  

 We issue UL contracts where we provide a secondary guarantee to the contract holder. The policy can remain in force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met. The reserves related to UL products with secondary guarantees are based on the application of a benefit ratio the same as our GDB features, which are discussed above. The level and direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the contracts. For more discussion, see “Results of Life Insurance” below.   

 ﻿  

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

 ﻿  

 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test where the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, goodwill is impaired and written down to the reporting unit’s fair value. The results of one test on one reporting unit cannot subsidize the results of another reporting unit.   

 ﻿  

 For the purposes of the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill, our reporting units (Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life  

 Insurance and Group Protection) correspond with our reporting segments.  

 ﻿  

 The fair values of our reporting units are comprised of the value of in-force (i.e., existing) business and the value of new business. Specifically, new business is representative of cash flows and profitability associated with policies or contracts we expect to issue in the future, reflecting our forecasts of future sales volume and product mix over a 10-year period. To determine the values of in-force and new business, we use a discounted cash flows technique that applies a discount rate reflecting the market expected, weighted-average rate of return adjusted for the risk factors associated with operations to the projected future cash flows for each reporting unit.  

 ﻿  

 50  

As of October 1, 2018, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units, and the fair value was in excess of each reporting unit’s carrying value for Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection.   

 ﻿  

 As of October 1, 2017, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units that resulted in impairment of the Life Insurance reporting unit goodwill of $905 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven primarily from the impact of the December 22, 2017, enactment of the Tax Act that increased the carrying value of the Life Insurance reporting unit in excess of its fair value.   

 ﻿  

 We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Factors that can influence the value of goodwill include the capital markets, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, consumer confidence and any items that can directly or indirectly affect new business future cash flows. Factors that could affect production levels and profitability of new business include mix of new business, pricing changes, customer acceptance of our products and distribution strength. Spread compression and related effects to profitability caused by lower interest rates affect the valuation of in-force business more significantly than the valuation of new business, as new business pricing assumptions reflect the current and anticipated future interest rate environment. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments.   

 ﻿  

 Examples of unfavorable changes to assumptions or factors that could result in future impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Lower expectations for future sales levels or future sales profitability; 

   ·    Higher discount rates on new business assumptions;

   ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements or changes to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements; and 

   ·    Valuations of significant mergers or acquisitions of companies or blocks of business that would provide relevant market-based inputs for our impairment assessment that could support less favorable conclusions regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units.

 Income Taxes   

 ﻿  

 Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for items recognized differently in its financial statements from amounts shown on its income tax returns and the federal income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis and interpretation of current tax laws and regulations. Management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets. These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Legislative changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, modifications or new regulations, administrative rulings, or court decisions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate.  

 ﻿  

 The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss deferred tax asset, will be realized. For additional information on our income taxes, see Note 7.

 Comparison of 2018 to 2017  

 ﻿  

 Net income decreased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    One-time federal income tax benefit in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability balance to reflect the new 21% marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by lower federal income tax expense in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act. 

   ·    Acquisition and integration costs incurred as part of our acquisition, higher strategic digitization expense and higher loss on early extinguishment of debt. 

 52  

   ·    Lower amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance in 2018 as a gain was fully amortized during the second quarter of 2017. 

   ·    Spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates. 

 ﻿  

 The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Goodwill impairment in our Life Insurance segment during 2017 (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above for more information). 

   ·    Realized gains as compared to realized losses in 2017. 

   ·    Growth in average account values, business in force and group earned premiums. 

   ·    The acquisition of Liberty Life effective May 1, 2018.  

   ·    The effect of unlocking. 

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2017 to 2016  

 ﻿  

 Net income increased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    One-time federal income tax benefit in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability balance to reflect the new 21% marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (see “Introduction – Executive Summary – Significant Operational Matters – Effective Tax Rates Resulting from the Tax Act” above for more information). 

   ·    Growth in average account values, business in force and group earned premiums. 

   ·    Lower losses on variable annuity net derivative results in 2017. 

   ·    Favorable investment income on alternative investments and higher prepayment and bond make-whole premiums. 

   ·    Legal expenses in 2016 related to certain investments. 

   ·    Higher realized losses in 2016 driven by asset disposals and an increase in OTTI attributable to individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings. 

 ﻿  

 The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Goodwill impairment in our Life Insurance segment during 2017 (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above for more information). 

   ·    The effect of unlocking. 

   ·    Lower amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance.

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2018 to 2017  

 ﻿  

 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values, partially offset by the effect of unlocking.  

   ·    Lower benefits due to the effect of unlocking, partially offset by an increase in the growth in benefit reserves due to equity market performance and costs associated with our hedge program. 

   ·    Amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance in 2018 as a result of the annuity reinsurance agreement (see “Additional Information” below). 

 ﻿  

 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking and higher average account values, resulting in higher trail commissions.  

   ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by lower prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields. 

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2017 to 2016  

 ﻿  

 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:

See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for more information about unlocking.  

 ﻿  

 Additional Information  

 ﻿  

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the federal income tax expense was primarily impacted by the lower marginal corporate income tax rate and tax law changes to the separate account dividends-received deduction as a result of the Tax Act and other items. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the federal income tax expense was driven by one-time and run-rate adjustments primarily associated with our separate account dividends-received deduction.  

 ﻿  

 Effective October 1, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Athene Holding Ltd. (“Athene”) to reinsure approximately $7.7 billion of in-force fixed and fixed indexed annuity products on a modified coinsurance (“Modco”) basis. The capital generated from this transaction was primarily used to fund the December 2018 accelerated share repurchase program of $450 million. We expect an ongoing reduction in income from operations in future periods as a result of this Modco reinsurance transaction. We continue to remain focused on the continued growth of both our fixed and variable annuity business. For additional information on our annuity reinsurance agreement and this accelerated share repurchase program, see Note 9 and “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,” respectively.  

 ﻿  

 New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. As a result of our strategic decision to participate in more segments of the marketplace, we returned to positive net flows during the fourth quarter of 2018. We believe our net flows will continue to remain positive and show continued improvement during 2019 as we continue to focus on our product and distribution expansion.   

 ﻿  

 The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused by full surrenders, deaths and other contract benefits. These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 9%, 9% and 8% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

 ﻿  

 Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in “Item 7A.

   (2)    The prior years have been restated to conform to the current year presentation, which has been modified to be consistent across our business segments. 

   (3)    We generally use the S&P 500 index as a benchmark for the performance of our variable account values. The account values of our variable annuity contracts are invested by our policyholders in a variety of investment options including, but not limited to, domestic and international equity securities and fixed income, which do not necessarily align with S&P 500 index performance. See Note 11 for additional information.  

 ﻿  

 We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily variable account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount. We may collect surrender charges when our fixed and variable annuity contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period to protect us from premature withdrawals. Fee income includes charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but excludes the attributed fees on our GLB riders; see “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” below for discussion of these attributed fees.

 A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our deferred fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

 Benefits for this segment include changes in income annuity reserves driven by premiums, changes in benefit reserves and costs associated with the hedging of our benefit ratio unlocking on benefit reserves associated with our variable annuity GDB and GLB riders. For a corresponding offset of changes in income annuity reserves, see footnote 1 of “Income (Loss) from Operations” above.

 ﻿  

 Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain types of commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues.

 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Lower federal income tax expense due to the change in the marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 

   ·    Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values.  

 ﻿  

 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums and spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields.

 ﻿  

 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher average account values driving higher trail commissions and higher incentive compensation as a result of production performance.  

 ﻿  

 See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for information about unlocking.  

 ﻿  

 Additional Information  

 ﻿  

 Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year.  

 ﻿  

 New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused primarily by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals. These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 11%, 12% and 13% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Net Flows By Market table below as “Multi-Fund® and other”), which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account values   

 60  

was 23%, 25% and 28% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.  

 ﻿  

 Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in “Item 7A.

   ·    Higher fee income due to growth in business in force and the effect of unlocking.  

   ·    Lower federal income tax expense due to the change in the marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 

   ·    Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by favorable investment income on alternative investments, partially offset by spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields and lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums. 

 ﻿  

 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:

 Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain  

 ﻿  

 Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”). For information on strategies we use to reduce the statutory reserve strain   

 64  

caused by XXX and AG38, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” below.  

 ﻿  

 Additional Information  

 ﻿  

 During 2018, we experienced slightly less favorable mortality as compared to our expectations.  

 ﻿  

 For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” and “Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”  

 ﻿  

 Insurance Premiums  

 ﻿  

 Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   

 ﻿  

 Fee Income

﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Fee income relates only to interest-sensitive products and includes cost of insurance assessments, expense assessments and surrender charges. Both cost of insurance and expense assessments can have deferrals and amortization related to DFEL. Cost of insurance and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   

 ﻿  

 Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.   

 ﻿  

 Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:  

 ﻿  

   ·    MoneyGuard®, our linked-benefit product – 15% of total expected premium deposits; 

   ·    UL, IUL and VUL – first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received; 

   ·    Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate-owned UL and VUL, first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received; and 

   ·    Term – 100% of annualized first-year premiums. 

 ﻿  

 We monitor the business environment, including but not limited to the regulatory and interest rate environments, and make changes to our product offerings and in-force products as needed, and as permitted under the terms of the policies, to sustain the future profitability of our segment.

 A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts. Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements. These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

 Benefits  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes primarily changes in reserves and dividends on traditional and other products. 

 ﻿  

 67  

Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves. These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments and benefits causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims. See “Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds” in Note 1 for additional information.  

 ﻿  

 Commissions and Other Expenses  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Commissions and costs that result directly from and are essential to successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the life of the contracts in relation to EGPs. For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business. When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for 2018 and 2017, the increase was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with higher commission rates.

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 (1) Consists of revenue from third parties for administrative services performed, which has a corresponding partial offset in  

  commissions and other expenses.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2018 to 2017  

 ﻿  

 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the acquisition of Liberty Life (see “Additional Information” below for more information) and lower federal income tax expense due to the change in the marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.  

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2017 to 2016  

 ﻿  

 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Higher insurance premiums due to more favorable persistency experience and higher sales across all of our product lines. 

   ·    Higher other revenues due to the recapture in 2017 of certain long-term disability business that was originally ceded to a reinsurer. 

   ·    Lower commissions and other expenses due to higher amortization of DAC in 2016 driven by model refinements, partially offset by higher strategic investments to enhance our customer experience and improve efficiency. 

 ﻿  

 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher benefits due to favorable reserve refinements in 2016 in our long-term disability business and the recapture in 2017 of certain long-term disability business that was originally ceded to a reinsurer. This increase was partially offset by favorable mortality experience and lower incidence and new claims severity in our disability business.  

 ﻿  

 Additional Information  

 ﻿  

 Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, includes eight months of activity from Liberty Life due to the acquisition that closed on May 1, 2018. The acquisition resulted in increases in all pre-tax line items presented in the table above. For more information about our acquisition, see Note 3.  

 ﻿  

 Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations as group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our total loss ratio, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. For every one percent increase in the total loss   

 69  

ratio, we would expect an approximate annual $31 million to $35 million decrease to income from operations. The effects are symmetrical for a comparable decrease in the loss ratio and, therefore, move in an equal and opposite direction.  

 ﻿  

 For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity.”   

 ﻿  

 Insurance Premiums  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.   

 ﻿  

 Sales relate to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our products.   

 ﻿  

 Net Investment Income  

 ﻿  

 We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.  

 ﻿  

 Benefits and Interest Credited  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Excludes the impact of the recapture of certain long-term disability business in the third quarter of 2017. 

 ﻿  

 Generally, we experience higher mortality in the first quarter of the year and higher disability claims in the fourth quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims. When comparing our life and disability loss ratios for 2018 and 2017, the increase in 2018 was driven primarily by the Liberty Life acquisition as we combined two blocks of business with different loss characteristics.  

 70  

Commissions and Other Expenses   

 ﻿  

 Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    See Note 3 for information regarding intangible assets acquired as part of the Liberty Life acquisition. 

 ﻿  

 Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized as a level percent of insurance premiums of the related contracts, depending on the block of business. Certain broker commissions that vary with and are related to paid premiums are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. Generally, we have higher amortization in the first quarter of the year due to a significant number of policies renewing in the quarter. When comparing DAC deferrals as a percentage of insurance premiums for 2018 and 2017, the decrease was driven by a change in our sales mix to products with lower commission rates as a result of the blocks of business acquired during 2018.  

 ﻿  

 71  

 RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS  

 ﻿  

 Income (Loss) from Operations  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes our disability income business, which has a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves.  

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2018 to 2017  

 ﻿  

 Loss from operations for Other Operations increased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Less favorable federal income tax benefit due to the change in the marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. 

   ·    Higher strategic digitization expense as part of our strategic digitization initiative. 

   ·    Lower amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance as a gain was fully amortized during 2017. 

   ·    Higher interest and debt expense driven by an increase in the average balance of outstanding debt. 

   ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, related to lower average invested assets driven by distributable earnings to our segments. 

 ﻿  

 The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the effect of changes in our stock price on our deferred compensation plans, as our stock price significantly decreased during 2018 (see “Other Expenses” below for more information).  

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2017 to 2016  

 ﻿  

 Loss from operations for Other Operations increased due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Lower amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance as a gain was fully amortized during 2017. 

   ·    Higher strategic digitization expense as part of our strategic digitization initiative. 

 ﻿  

 The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Lower benefits due to modifying certain assumptions in 2016 on the reserves supporting our run-off disability income business. 

   ·    More favorable federal income tax benefits due to excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in 2017 and the release of reserves for tax contingencies associated with a prior tax year that closed in the third quarter of 2017. 

   ·    Lower interest and debt expense driven by a decline in both average balances of outstanding debt and rates. 

 ﻿  

 Additional Information  

 ﻿  

 We expect to continue making investments as part of our strategic digitization initiative as discussed above in “Introduction – Executive Summary – Significant Operational Matters – Strategic Digitization Initiative.”   

 ﻿  

 72  

Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   

 ﻿  

 We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.  

 Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the business segments and Other Operations.   

 ﻿  

 The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.  

 ﻿  

 Benefits  

 ﻿  

 Benefits are recognized when incurred for institutional pension products and disability income business.  

 ﻿  

 Other Expenses  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, the portion of our deferred compensation plan expense attributable to participants’ selection of LNC stock as the measure for their investment return and other expenses not allocated to our business segments.  

   (2)    Includes state guaranty funds assessments to cover losses to contract holders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies. Mandatory assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states. 

   (3)    Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its use of LOCs.  

 ﻿  

 Interest and Debt Expense  

 ﻿  

 Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital. For additional information on our financing activities, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” below.

 REALIZED GAIN (LOSS) AND BENEFIT RATIO UNLOCKING  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying realized gain (loss), after-DAC (1) and benefit ratio unlocking (in millions) were as follows:   

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds and funds withheld reinsurance assets and liabilities. 

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2018 to 2017   

 ﻿  

 We had higher realized losses due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Higher losses on variable annuity net derivatives results attributable to unfavorable hedge program performance due to more volatile capital markets, partially offset by favorable GLB NPR component due to an increase in our associated reserves and the widening of our credit spread. 

   ·    Higher realized losses related to certain investments originating from asset sales to reposition the portfolio and a decline in the mark-to-market of equity securities due to equity market declines.  

 ﻿  

 Comparison of 2017 to 2016   

 ﻿  

 We had lower realized losses due primarily to the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Lower losses on variable annuity net derivatives results attributable to favorable hedge program performance due to less volatile capital markets.  

   ·    A decrease in realized losses related to certain investments originating from decreased OTTI and fewer asset sales attributable to improvements of select corporate bond holdings within the energy and other commodity sectors. 

   ·    Legal expenses in 2016 related to certain investments. 

 ﻿  

 The above components of excluded realized gain (loss) are described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax.  

 ﻿  

 See “Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below for a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined.  

 ﻿  

 See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” above for more information about unlocking.  

 ﻿  

 74  

Operating Realized Gain (Loss)  

 ﻿  

 Operating realized gain (loss) includes indexed annuity and IUL net derivatives results representing the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity and IUL products. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity and IUL contracts.  

 ﻿  

 Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the benefit reserves and the embedded derivative reserves based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).  

 ﻿  

 We also include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain (loss) and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized gain (loss). For our Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in fee income.   

 ﻿  

 Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments  

 ﻿  

 See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below.  

 ﻿  

 Gain (Loss) on the Mark-to-Market on Certain Instruments  

 ﻿  

 Gain (loss) on the mark-to-market on certain instruments, including those associated with our consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) represents changes in the fair values of certain derivative investments (not including those associated with our variable annuity net derivatives results), reinsurance related embedded derivatives and trading securities.  

 ﻿  

 See Note 4 for information about our consolidated VIEs.   

 ﻿  

 Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results  

 ﻿  

 Our variable annuity net derivatives results include the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments. In addition, these results include the changes in reserves not accounted for at fair value and results from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders.   

 ﻿  

 We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivative reserves. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative reserves. Our variable annuity net derivatives results can be volatile, especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. The NPR factors affect the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve. Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded derivative. Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are different on a pre- and post-NPR basis. We utilize a model based on our holding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spread adjusted for items, such as the security of policyholder liabilities relative to the security of insurance company debt. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the effect of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries.

 ﻿  

 See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB” above for additional information about our guaranteed benefits.  

 ﻿  

 Indexed Annuity Forward-Starting Option  

 ﻿  

 The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

 CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Investment Objective  

 ﻿  

 Invested assets are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  

 ﻿  

 Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification  

 ﻿  

 Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   

 ﻿  

 We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   

 ﻿  

 77  

 Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios  

 ﻿  

 We adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, in 2018, which resulted in a new classification and measurement of our equity securities. See Note 2 for additional information. Fixed maturity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Details underlying our fixed maturity AFS securities by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.  

 ﻿

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes unrealized gains and (losses) on impaired securities related to changes in the fair value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date. 

   (2)    Certain of our trading securities support our Modco reinsurance agreements and the investment results are passed directly to the reinsurers. See “Trading Securities” below for more information. 

 79  

 AFS Securities  

 ﻿  

 In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to AOCI. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   

 ﻿  

 The quality of our fixed maturity AFS securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second lowest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.  

 ﻿  

 Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).   

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 95% and 88%, respectively, of the total fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position were investment grade. See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on fixed maturity AFS securities as of December 31, 2018, increased by $2.0 billion since December 31, 2017. As more fully described in Note 1, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2018, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.  

 ﻿  

 80  

In our evaluation of OTTI, we concluded: (i) that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (ii) that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:  

 ﻿  

   ·    The current economic environment and market conditions; 

   ·    Our business strategy and current business plans; 

   ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk; 

   ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies; 

   ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts; 

   ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and 

   ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands. 

 ﻿  

 To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security; 

   ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;  

   ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;  

   ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and 

   ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.  

 ﻿  

 As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $117.6 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $106.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. If it were necessary to liquidate fixed maturity AFS securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those fixed maturity AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $48.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, rather than selling fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point in time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.   

 ﻿  

 See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 and Note 5 for additional discussion.  

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $15.3 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, representing 13% of total invested assets.  

 ﻿  

 Trading Securities  

 ﻿  

 Trading securities, which in certain cases support reinsurance funds withheld and our Modco reinsurance agreements, are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in net income as they occur. Investment results for these certain portfolios, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements. Offsetting these amounts in certain cases are corresponding changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement. See Notes 1 and 9 for more information regarding our accounting for Modco.  

 ﻿  

 Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)  

 ﻿  

 Our fixed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite effect. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.   

 ﻿  

 We limit the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities with improving collateral performance, and by primarily investing in securities that are current pay and senior priority in their trust structure. A significant amount of assets in our MBS portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, supported in the securitization structure by junior securities or purchased at discounted prices significantly lower than their expected recovery value, enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.  

 ﻿

Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be affected by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS and RMBS. Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime; Alt-A; and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.   

 ﻿  

 Delinquency and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans have been showing positive trends, and, as long as the unemployment rate remains stable to improving, we expect these trends to continue. We continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the first loss. Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $4.0 billion and a net unrealized gain of $93 million as of December 31, 2018.

The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $447 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018. AFS securities represented $443 million, or 99%, and trading securities represented $4 million, or 1%, of the subprime exposure as of December 31, 2018. The table below summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of residential mortgages (in millions) as of December 31, 2018:

   (2)    Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $86 million that primarily support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $86 million in trading securities consisted of $78 million prime, $4 million Alt-A and $4 million subprime.  

   (3)    Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $84 million that primarily support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $84 million in trading securities consisted of $76 million prime, $3 million Alt-A and $5 million subprime.  

   (4)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second lowest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.  

 ﻿  

 None of these investments included any direct investments in subprime lenders or mortgages. We are not aware of material exposure to subprime loans in our alternative asset portfolio.

 Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities  

 ﻿  

 When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the position of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the position of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of securities in an unrealized loss position on our future earnings.   

 ﻿

The composition by industry categories of all securities in an unrealized loss position (in millions) as of December 31, 2018, was as follows:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

   (2)    As of December 31, 2018, no mortgage loans were in foreclosure. As of December 31, 2017, one commercial mortgage loan was in foreclosure. 

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018, no commercial mortgage loans on real estate were impaired. As of December 31, 2017, three commercial mortgage loans on real estate were impaired, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. No residential mortgage loans on real estate were impaired as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. The total outstanding principal and interest on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $1 million and $4 million, respectively.

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses. 

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, alternative investments included investments in 237 and 224 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented approximately 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 ﻿  

 We earn investment income on our general account assets supporting fixed annuity, term life, whole life, UL, interest-sensitive whole life and the fixed portion of retirement plan and VUL products. The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  

 ﻿  

 Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums  

 ﻿  

 Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.  

 ﻿  

 The decrease in prepayment and make-whole premiums when comparing 2018 to 2017 was attributable primarily to decreased refinancing activity.   

 ﻿  

 Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments  

 ﻿  

 Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity. See Note 6 for more information. 

   (2)    Includes market adjustments on equity securities still held of $(17) million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  

 ﻿  

 Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses.   

 ﻿  

 Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During 2018 and 2017, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects   

 89  

declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   

 ﻿  

 We consider economic factors and circumstances within industries and countries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the position of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.  

 ﻿  

 When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Write-downs for OTTI and Valuation Allowances” above for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The $7 million of impairments taken during 2018 were all credit-related impairments. The decrease in write-downs for OTTI when comparing 2018 to 2017 was primarily attributable to the stabilization of certain corporate bond holdings within the energy and other commodity sectors that experienced deteriorating fundamentals in prior years.   

 ﻿  

 We recognized less than $1 million of OTTI in OCI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We recognized $55 million of gross OTTI in OCI, offset by $12 million for the change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in OTTI recognized in OCI was primarily attributable to the fair values and recovery values being more aligned on impaired securities resulting in a decline of the non-credit portion of the impairment.   

 ﻿  

 REINSURANCE  

 ﻿  

 Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of our life insurance risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limit is reinsured with other insurers. We seek life and annuity reinsurance coverage to limit our exposure to mortality losses and/or to enhance our capital and risk management. We acquire other reinsurance as applicable with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances. The consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” reflect insurance premiums, insurance fees, benefits and DAC amortization net of insurance ceded. Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements. We utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. With regard to risk retention from a consolidated basis, these inter-company agreements do not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding reserve financing and LOC expenses from inter-company reinsurance agreements, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Uses of Capital – Contractual Obligations” below.  

 ﻿  

 We focus on obtaining reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers. We have established standards and criteria for our use and selection of reinsurers. In order for a new reinsurer to participate in our current program, we require the reinsurer to have an A.M. Best rating of A+ or greater or an S&P rating of AA- or better and a specified RBC percentage. If the reinsurer does not have these ratings,   

 90  

we generally require them to post collateral as described below; however, we may initially waive the collateral requirements based on the facts and circumstances. In addition, we may require collateral from a reinsurer to mitigate credit/collectability risk. Typically, in such cases, the reinsurer must either maintain minimum specified ratings and RBC ratios or establish the specified quality and quantity of collateral. Similarly, we have also required collateral in connection with books of business sold pursuant to indemnity reinsurance agreements.  

 ﻿  

 Reinsurers, including affiliated reinsurers, that are not licensed, accredited or authorized in the state of domicile of the reinsured (“ceding company”), i.e., unauthorized reinsurers, are required to post statutorily prescribed forms of collateral for the ceding company to receive reinsurance credit. The three primary forms of collateral are: (i) qualifying assets held in a reserve credit trust; (ii) irrevocable, unconditional, evergreen LOCs issued by a qualified U.S. financial institution; and (iii) assets held by the ceding company in a segregated funds withheld account. Collateral must be maintained in accordance with the rules of the ceding company’s state of domicile and must be readily accessible by the ceding company to cover claims under the reinsurance agreement. Accordingly, our insurance subsidiaries require unauthorized reinsurers to post acceptable forms of collateral to support their reinsurance obligations to us.   

 ﻿  

 Effective October 1, 2018, we entered into a Modco agreement with Athene to reinsure fixed and fixed indexed annuity products, which resulted in a $7.5 billion deposit asset reflected within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018. For additional information, see “Results of Annuities – Income (Loss) from Operations – Additional Information” above and Note 9.   

 ﻿  

 Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 84%, or $14.8 billion, of our total reinsurance recoverable was secured by collateral for our benefit. Of this amount, $14.5 billion was held by reinsurers in reserve credit trusts (such reserve credit trusts are held by non-affiliated reinsurers; therefore, they are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets), $1.7 billion was reflected as funds withheld reinsurance liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018, although only $224 million can be utilized as collateral due to excess funds withheld above the reinsurance recoverable from our reinsurers, and $95 million was secured by LOCs for which we are the beneficiary, an off-balance sheet arrangement.  

 ﻿  

 We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration risk with our largest reinsurers at least annually. We monitor all of our existing reinsurers’ financial strength ratings on a monthly basis. We also monitor our reinsurers’ financial health, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business, statutory surplus, RBC levels, statutory earnings and fluctuations, current claims payment aging and our reinsurers’ own reinsurers. In addition, we present at least annually information regarding our reinsurance exposures to the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. For more discussion of our counterparty risk with our reinsurers, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Operational Matters – We face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of operations.”

  REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION  

 ﻿  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 ﻿  

 Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   

 ﻿  

 Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $1.9 billion, $788 million and $1.3 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries. 

 The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.   

 ﻿  

 91  

Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company. See “Part IV – Item 15(a)(2) Financial Statement Schedules – Schedule II – Condensed Financial Information of Registrant” for the parent company cash flow statement.  

 ﻿  

 Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments  

 ﻿  

 We are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries. Our primary  

 assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends  

 and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries  

 to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.  

 ﻿  

 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. LNL’s subsidiaries, the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”), a New York-domiciled insurance company, and LLACB, a New Hampshire-domiciled company, are bound by similar restrictions, under New York law and New Hampshire law, respectively. Under both New York and New Hampshire law, the applicable statutory limitation on dividends is equal to the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  

 ﻿  

 Indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in  

 relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a  

 dividend that violates these standards. In the event the Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary  

 is inadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received  

 from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary.  

 ﻿  

 We expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $825 million in 2019 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.   

 ﻿  

 We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further OTTI could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.  

 92  

Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus   

 ﻿  

 Our insurance subsidiaries must maintain certain regulatory capital levels. We utilize the RBC ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our insurance subsidiaries. The RBC ratio is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries, as a reduction in our insurance subsidiaries’ surplus may affect their RBC ratios and dividend-paying capacity. For a discussion of RBC ratios, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation – Risk-Based Capital.”  

 ﻿  

 Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory, and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations,” our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to reinsurance captives. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner. We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. Included in the LOCs issued as of December 31, 2018, was approximately $3.3 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($350 million will expire in 2019, $1.0 billion will expire in 2021 and $1.9 billion relates to arrangements that will expire by 2031). For information on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in Note 13. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have also issued long-term notes of $3.1 billion to finance a portion of the excess reserves as of December 31, 2018; of this amount, $2.1 billion involve exposure to VIEs. For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 4. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions primarily supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. While we believe we have sufficient capital to support the statutory reserves on this business, an inability to obtain efficient capital market solutions could affect our returns on these types of products.  

 ﻿  

 Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company. The NAIC’s adoption of the Valuation Manual that defines a principles-based reserving framework for newly issued life insurance policies was effective January 1, 2017. Principles-based reserving places a greater weight on our past experience and anticipated future experience as well as considers current economic conditions in calculating life insurance product reserves in accordance with statutory accounting principles. We adopted the framework for our newly issued term business in 2017 and will phase in the framework by January 1, 2020, for all other newly issued life insurance products. We believe that these changes may reduce our future use of captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries for reserve financing transactions for our life insurance business. For more information on principles-based reserving, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation.”  

 ﻿  

 Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. The NAIC is currently in the process of implementing changes to the statutory reserving, capital and accounting framework for variable annuities that will go into effect as of January 1, 2020. The NAIC is also considering modifications to the NAIC RBC C-1 capital charges for bonds, which may impact the level of the C-1 related RBC we are required to hold. For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Federal Regulation – Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.”  

 ﻿  

 Changes in equity markets may also affect the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries. We may decide to reallocate available capital among our insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurance subsidiaries, which would result in different RBC ratios for our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the equity markets can affect the value of our variable annuity separate accounts. When the market value of our separate account assets increases, the statutory surplus within our insurance subsidiaries also increases. Contrarily, when the market value of our separate account assets decreases, the statutory surplus within our insurance subsidiaries may also decrease, which may affect RBC ratios, and in the case of our separate account assets becoming less than the related product liabilities, we must allocate additional capital to fund the difference.  

 ﻿  

 We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.   

 ﻿  

 Financing Activities  

 ﻿  

 Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   

 ﻿  

 We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion (amortization) of discounts and premiums, amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of adjustments from discontinued hedges, as applicable. 

   (2)    We refinanced a $250 million floating rate loan that was scheduled to mature on June 6, 2018, into a $200 million floating rate loan maturing on June 6, 2023. 

   (3)    To hedge the variability in rates, we purchased interest rate swaps to lock in a fixed rate of approximately 5% over the remaining terms of the capital securities.  

 ﻿  

 On February 12, 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of $150 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due 2023 and $450 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.35% senior notes due 2048. We used these proceeds to repurchase $200 million of our 7.00% senior notes due 2018 and $287 million of our 8.75% senior notes due 2019. In addition, on February 12, 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.80% senior notes due 2028. We used these proceeds, together with cash on hand and other arrangements, to fund our acquisition as described in Note 3. As of December 31, 2018, the holding company had available liquidity of $465 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.   

 ﻿  

 For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 13.  

 ﻿  

 We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.  

 ﻿  

 If current credit ratings or claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event with respect to LNC if its long-term senior debt ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s); or with respect to LNL if its financial strength ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of December 31, 2018. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.  

 ﻿  

 Our indicative credit ratings published by the primary rating agencies are set forth below. Securities are rated at the time of issuance so actual ratings may differ from the indicative ratings. There may be other rating agencies that also provide credit ratings, which we do not disclose in our reports.   

 ﻿  

 The long-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:   

   ·    A.M. Best – aaa to d 

   ·    Fitch – AAA to D  

   ·    Moody’s – Aaa to C  

   ·    S&P – AAA to D

   ·    Moody’s – P-1 to NP  

   ·    S&P – A-1+ to D  

 As of February 14, 2019, our indicative short-term credit ratings as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our short-term credit were as follows:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings.”  

 ﻿  

 All ratings are on outlook stable, except Fitch ratings, which are on outlook positive. All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that we can maintain these ratings. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  

 ﻿  

 Management monitors the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities. If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”). This would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed. If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient shares of common stock or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. We have not triggered either the net income test or the overall stockholders’ equity test looking forward to the quarters ending March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019. For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve specified capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels.”  

 ﻿  

 Alternative Sources of Liquidity  

 ﻿  

 In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of December 31, 2018, the holding company had a net outstanding receivable (payable) of $(12) million from (to) certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed (borrowed) by the holding company and subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana and New Hampshire-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.  

 ﻿  

 Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. Our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”). Membership allows LNL access to the FHLBI’s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets, agency securities or U.S. Treasury securities. LNL had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $5.0 billion under the FHLBI facility as of December   

 95  

31, 2018. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBI’s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LNL. As of December 31, 2018, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $4.2 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.  

 ﻿  

 Cash Flows from Collateral on Derivatives  

 ﻿  

 Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset decreases (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability decreases (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). During 2018, our collateral payable for derivative investments decreased due primarily to increasing interest rates that decreased the fair values of our associated over-the-counter derivative investments. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have liquidity sources, as discussed above, to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.

 Uses of Capital  

 ﻿  

 Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders, to repurchase our stock and to repay debt.   

 ﻿  

 Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   

 ﻿  

 One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying this activity (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 On October 31, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.33 to $0.37 per share. Additionally, we may repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2019 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.”

Other Uses of Capital

 In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.  

 ﻿  

 We made an investment in our Group Protection business through our acquisition of Liberty Life, now a subsidiary of LNL, which impacted our liquidity and capital position. For additional information on our acquisition, see “Introduction – Executive Summary” above and Note 3.  

 ﻿  

 Contractual Obligations  

 ﻿  

 Details underlying our future estimated cash payments for our contractual obligations (in millions) as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Estimates are based on financial projections over 40 years. New business issued or acquired, business ceded or sold, changes to or variances from actuarial assumptions and economic conditions will cause these amounts to change over time, possibly materially. See Note 1 for details of what these liabilities include and represent. 

   (2)    Represents principal amounts of debt only. See Note 13 for additional information. 

   (3)    Estimates are based on the level of capacity we expect to utilize during the life of the LOCs and other reserve financing arrangements. See Note 13 for additional information. 

   (4)    Excludes collateral payable held for derivative investments. See Note 5 for additional information. 

   (5)    See Note 14 for additional information. 

   (6)    Includes a maximum annual increase related to the Consumer Price Index. See Note 14 for additional information. 

   (7)    Includes anticipated funding for benefit payments for our retirement and postretirement plans through 2028 and known payments under deferred compensation arrangements. In addition to these benefit payments, we periodically fund the employees’ defined benefit plans. The majority of contributions and benefit payments are made by our insurance subsidiaries with little effect on holding company cash flow. See Note 17 for additional information. 

 ﻿  

 Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $16 million of unrecognized tax benefits and its associated interest have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 7 for additional information.  

 ﻿  

 97  

Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. Details underlying our contingent commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements (in millions) as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:

 Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  

 As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience a period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital.   

 ﻿  

 For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section and that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.
