INTRODUCTION  

News Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, News Corporation, News Corp, the Company, we, or us) is a global diversified media and information services company comprised of businesses across a range of media, including: news and information services, subscription video services in Australia, book publishing and digital real estate services.  

In April 2018, News Corp and Telstra combined their respective 50% interests in the Foxtel Group and News Corps 100% interest in FOX SPORTS Australia into a new company, NXE Australia Pty Ltd. (the Transaction), which the Company refers to herein as Foxtel for post-Transaction periods. Following the completion of the Transaction, News Corp owns a 65% interest in the combined business, with Telstra owning the remaining 35%. Consequently, the Company began consolidating the Foxtel Group in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. (See Note 4Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). For periods prior to the completion of the Transaction, the Company continues to refer to its equity investment in the Foxtel Group as Foxtel. The results of the combined business are reported within the Subscription Video Services segment. To enhance the comparability of the financial information provided to users, the Company has supplementally included pro forma financial information for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 reflecting the Transaction within its discussion and analysis below.  

The consolidated financial statements are referred to herein as the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidated statements of operations are referred to herein as the Statements of Operations. The consolidated balance sheets are referred to herein as the Balance Sheets. The consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to herein as the Statements of Cash Flows. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP).

 including: National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, the domestic football league, the Australian Rugby Union and various motorsports programming. Foxtel also operates Foxtel Now, an over-the-top, or OTT, service, and Kayo, a sports-only OTT service.  

ANC operates the SKY NEWS network, Australias 24-hour multi-channel, multi-platform news service. ANC channels are distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand and available on Foxtel and Sky Network Television NZ. ANC also owns and operates the international Australia Channel IPTV service and offers content across a variety of digital media platforms, including mobile, podcasts and social media websites.  

       

Book PublishingThe Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins, the second largest consumer book publisher in the world, with operations in 17 countries and particular strengths in general fiction, nonfiction, childrens and religious publishing. HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded publishing imprints, including Harper, William Morrow, HarperCollins Childrens Books, Avon, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson, and publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Rick Warren, Sarah Young and Agatha Christie and popular titles such as The Hobbit, Goodnight Moon, To Kill a Mockingbird, Jesus Calling and Hillbilly Elegy.  

       

Digital Real Estate ServicesThe Digital Real Estate Services segment consists of the Companys 61.6% interest in REA Group and 80% interest in Move. The remaining 20% interest in Move is held by REA Group. REA Group is a market-leading digital media business specializing in property and is listed on the ASX (ASX: REA). REA Group advertises property and property-related services on its websites and mobile apps across Australia and Asia, including Australias leading residential, commercial and share property websites, realestate.com.au, realcommercial.com.au, Flatmates.com.au and spacely.com.au, and property portals in Asia. In addition, REA Group provides property-related data to the financial sector and financial services through an end-to-end digital property search and financing experience and a mortgage broking offering.  

Move is a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S. and primarily operates realtor.com®, a premier real estate information and services marketplace. Move offers real estate advertising solutions to agents and brokers, including its ConnectionsSM Plus and AdvantageSM Pro products as well as its Opcity performance and subscription-based services. Move also offers a number of professional software and services products, including Top Producer®, and ListHubTM.  

       

OtherThe Other segment consists primarily of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate Strategy Group and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Companys Strategy Group identifies new products and services across its businesses to increase revenues and profitability and targets and assesses potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions.  

News and Information Services  

Revenue at the News and Information Services segment is derived primarily from the sale of advertising, circulation and subscriptions, as well as licensing. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising continue to affect revenues. Advertising revenues at the News and Information Services segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the Companys second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. Circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the Companys and/or competitors products, as well as by promotional activities.  

Operating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions and radio sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.  

The News and Information Services segments advertising volume and rates, circulation and the price of paper are the key variables whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the Companys operating results and cash  

44   

Table of Contents 

 flow. The Company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume and rates, circulation and paper prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. The Company continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. Paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. The Companys expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. paper suppliers. The News and Information Services segments products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. Competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. The success of these products also depends upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. Competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. Such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of consumer demographics.  

The Companys traditional print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. The Company is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move in advertising from print to digital. These alternative media formats could impact the Companys overall performance, positively or negatively. In addition, technologies have been and will continue to be developed that allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact advertising rates or revenues.  

As a multi-platform news provider, the Company recognizes the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital products. Smartphones, tablets and similar devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the Company to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. The Company continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms.  

Subscription Video Services  

The Companys Subscription Video Services segment consists of (i) its 65% interest in Foxtel and (ii) ANC. Foxtel is the largest pay-TV provider in Australia, delivering nearly 200 channels including the leading sports programming content in Australia. Foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue.  

Foxtel competes for audiences primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional Free-To-Air (FTA) TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, and new content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. These providers include, Internet Protocol television, or IPTV, and subscription video-on-demand providers such as Fetch TV, Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video; streaming services offered through digital media providers; as well as programmers and distributors that provide, or have indicated an intention to provide, content directly to consumers over the internet.  

ANC operates the SKY NEWS network, Australias 24-hour multi-channel, multi-platform news service, and also owns and operates the Australia Channel IPTV service for international markets. Revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-TV providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising.  

The most significant operating expenses of the Subscription Video Services segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations, expenses related to cable, satellite, internet and broadband transmission costs and studio  

45   

Table of Contents 

 and engineering expense. The expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the Subscription Video Services segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of Foxtels local and international sports programming. Programming rights associated with a dedicated channel are amortized over 12 months. Other expenses include subscriber acquisition costs such as sales costs and marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. Additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.  

Book Publishing  

The Book Publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, childrens and religious books in the U.S. and internationally. The revenues and operating results of the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. The book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. This marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms and distribution channels and other factors. Each book is a separate and distinct product and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.  

Major new title releases represent a significant portion of the Book Publishing segments sales throughout the fiscal year. Print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Book Publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. Operating expenses for the Book Publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.  

Digital Real Estate Services  

The Digital Real Estate Services segment generates revenue through property and property-related advertising and services, including the sale of real estate listing and performance-based products to agents, brokers and developers, display advertising on its residential real estate and commercial property sites and residential property data services to the financial sector. The Digital Real Estate Services segment also generates revenue through licenses of certain professional software products on a subscription basis and fees and commissions from referrals generated through its end-to-end digital property search and financing offering and mortgage broking services. Significant expenses associated with these sites, services and software solutions include development costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, broker commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.  

Consumers are increasingly turning to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information and services. The Digital Real Estate Services segments success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and financial services professionals and attractive to its advertisers. The Digital Real Estate Services segment operates in a highly competitive digital environment with other real estate and property websites.  

Other  

The Other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate Strategy Group and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Companys Strategy Group identifies new products and services across the Companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and targets and assesses potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions.

Other Business Developments  

In June 2019, the Company announced that it is reviewing strategic options for News America Marketing, including a potential sale. There is no assurance regarding the timing of any action or transaction, nor that the strategic review will result in a transaction or other strategic change.  

In October 2018, the Company acquired Opcity Inc. (Opcity), a market-leading real estate technology platform that matches qualified home buyers and sellers with real estate professionals in real time. The total transaction value was approximately $210 million, consisting of approximately $182 million in cash, net of $7 million of cash acquired and approximately $28 million in deferred payments and restricted stock unit awards for Opcitys founders and qualifying employees, which is being recognized as compensation expense over the three years following the closing. Included in the cash amount was approximately $20 million that is being held back for approximately 18 months after closing. The acquisition broadens realtor.com®s lead generation product portfolio, allowing real estate professionals to choose between traditional lead products or a concierge-based model that provides highly vetted, transaction-ready leads. Opcity is a subsidiary of Move, and its results are included within the Digital Real Estate Services segment.  

In addition to the acquisitions noted above, the Company used $26 million of cash for additional acquisitions during fiscal 2019, primarily relating to Racing Internet Services (Racenet) and Medium Rare Content Agency (Medium Rare), an integrated content agency. Racenet and Medium Rare are subsidiaries of News Corp Australia and the results of each are included within the News and Information Services segment.  

In June 2018, REA Group acquired Hometrack Australia Pty Ltd (Hometrack Australia) for approximately A$130 million (approximately $100 million) in cash, which was funded with a mix of cash on hand and debt of A$70 million (approximately $53 million). Hometrack Australia is a provider of property data services to the financial sector and it allows REA Group to deliver more property data and insights to its customers. Hometrack Australia is a subsidiary of REA Group, and its results are included within the Digital Real Estate Services segment.  

In April 2018, News Corp and Telstra combined their respective 50% interests in the Foxtel Group and News Corps 100% interest in FOX SPORTS Australia into a new company. Following the completion of the Transaction, News Corp owns a 65% interest in the combined business, with Telstra owning the remaining 35%. The combination allows Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia to leverage their media platforms and content to improve services for consumers and advertisers. The results of Foxtel are reported within the Subscription Video Services segment, and Foxtel is considered a separate reporting unit for purposes of the Companys annual goodwill impairment review.  

In July 2017, REA Group acquired an 80.3% interest in Smartline Home Loans Pty Limited (Smartline) for approximately A$70 million in cash (approximately $55 million). The minority shareholders have the option to sell the remaining 19.7% interest to REA Group beginning three years after closing at a price dependent on the financial performance of Smartline. If the option is not exercised, the minority interest will become mandatorily redeemable four years after closing. As a result, REA Group recognized a liability of $12 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 for the present value of the amount expected to be paid for the remaining interest based on the formula specified in the acquisition agreement. Smartline is one of Australias premier mortgage broking franchise groups, and the acquisition provides REA Groups financial services business with greater scale and capability. Smartline is a subsidiary of REA Group, and its results are included within the Digital Real Estate Services segment.

RevenuesRevenues increased $1,050 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The Revenue increase was primarily due to higher revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment of $1,198 million resulting in large part from the Transaction, which contributed $1,289 million to the increase and higher revenues of $18 million at the Digital Real Estate Services segment. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues at the News and Information Services segment of $163 million, primarily due to the $154 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, weakness in the print advertising market and lower revenues at News America Marketing of $61 million, partially offset by cover and subscription price increases and digital subscriber growth, primarily at The Wall Street Journal and in Australia. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $72 million.  

The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $311 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.  

Operating expensesOperating expenses increased $719 million, or 15%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in Operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was mainly due to higher operating expenses at the Subscription Video Services segment of $822 million primarily resulting from the Transaction. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense decrease of $153 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.

Table of Contents 

Selling, general and administrativeSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $158 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses of $169 million at the Subscription Video Services segment, primarily as a result of the Transaction, and the absence of the $46 million impact from the reversal of a portion of the previously accrued liability for the U.K. Newspaper Matters and the corresponding receivable as the result of an agreement reached with the relevant tax authority with respect to certain employment taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $109 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

Depreciation and amortizationDepreciation and amortization expense increased $187 million, or 40%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of an additional $185 million of depreciation and amortization expense at the Subscription Video Services segment, mainly due to the Transaction.  

Impairment and restructuring chargesDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $92 million and $71 million, respectively.  

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $96 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.  

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $280 million primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the News America Marketing reporting unit and impairment of goodwill at the FOX SPORTS Australia reporting unit.  

See Note 5Restructuring Programs and Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Equity losses of affiliatesEquity losses of affiliates improved by $989 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in losses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to the absence of a $957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Companys investment in Foxtel recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

 (a)  

Following completion of the Transaction in April 2018, News Corp ceased accounting for Foxtel as an equity method investment and began consolidating its results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 4Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions and Note 6Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included the write-down discussed above. See Note 6Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASC 350), the Company amortized $49 million related to excess cost over the Companys proportionate share of its investments underlying net assets allocated to finite-lived intangible assets during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Such amortization is reflected in Equity losses of affiliates in the Statement of Operations.  

49   

Table of Contents 

 (b)  

Other equity affiliates, net for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 include losses primarily from the Companys interest in Elara. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 the Company recognized $13 million in non-cash write-downs of certain equity method investments carrying values. The write-downs were reflected in Equity losses of affiliates in the Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. See Note 6Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Interest expense, netInterest expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 increased $52 million, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of the Transaction. As a result of the Transaction, the Company consolidated outstanding debt of approximately $1.8 billion. See Note 9Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Other, netOther, net increased $357 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. See Note 21Additional Financial Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Income tax (expense) benefitThe Companys income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were $126 million and 36%, respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $355 million and (33%), respectively, for fiscal 2018.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 the Company recorded a tax expense of $126 million on pre-tax income of $354 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The higher tax rate was primarily due to lower tax benefits on impairments, valuation allowances being recorded against tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions with operating losses and the impact from foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a tax expense of $355 million on pre-tax loss of $1,089 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The lower tax rate was primarily due to $340 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs of approximately $1.3 billion, $88 million of lower tax benefits related to the $337 million loss for the settlement of the pre-existing contractual arrangement between FOX SPORTS Australia and Foxtel as a result of the Transaction and a tax expense of $237 million related to the impact of the Tax Act, offset by a tax benefit of approximately $49 million related to the settlement of pre-Separation tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service.  

Net income (loss)Net income (loss) increased $1,672 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as  

compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower equity losses of affiliates resulting from the absence of the  

$957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Companys investment in Foxtel recognized in fiscal 2018, lower impairment and restructuring charges resulting from the absence of non-cash impairment charges of $280 million primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the News America Marketing reporting unit and impairment of goodwill at the FOX SPORTS Australia reporting unit, higher Other, net resulting from the absence of a $337 million loss related to the Transaction, primarily resulting from the write-off of the FOX SPORTS Australia channel distribution agreement intangible asset, the absence of the $237 million negative impact of the Tax Act recognized in fiscal 2018 and higher Total Segment EBITDA, partially offset by higher Depreciation and amortization and Interest expense.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $3 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher results at REA Group offset by the noncontrolling interest impact from Foxtel.  

Segment Analysis  

Segment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest expense, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA.  

50   

Table of Contents 

Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the Companys businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).  

Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Companys financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Companys operations and other factors that affect the Companys reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods. The following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Total Segment EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:

News and Information Services (49% and 57% of the Companys consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, revenues at the News and Information Services segment decreased $163 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The revenue decrease was primarily due to lower Advertising revenues of $189 million resulting mainly from weakness in the print advertising market, the $74 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at News America Marketing of $61 million, partially offset by digital advertising growth, primarily in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 increased $13 million as compared to fiscal 2018 mainly due to cover and subscription price increases, digital subscriber growth, primarily at The Wall Street Journal and in Australia, higher professional information business revenues at Dow Jones and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in Australia. These increases were partially offset by the $61 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and print volume declines in Australia and in the U.K., primarily at The Sun. Other revenues increased $13 million as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the $38 million net benefit related to News UKs exit from the partnership for Sun Bets in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, partially offset by the $19 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower brand partnership revenues in the U.K. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $154 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, Segment EBITDA at the News and Information Services segment increased $20 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution from Dow Jones of $17 million, primarily related to higher revenues, and from News Corp Australia of $9 million, primarily due to lower newsprint, production and distribution costs and cost savings initiatives.  

Dow Jones  

Revenues were $1,559 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $48 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2018 revenues of $1,511 million. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $58 million, primarily due to the $44 million impact from digital subscriber growth and digital subscription price increases at The Wall Street Journal, as well as $21 million of higher professional information business revenues led by Dow Jones Risk & Compliance, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Advertising revenues decreased $13 million, primarily due to weakness in the print advertising market, partially offset by digital advertising growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

News Corp Australia  

Revenues at the Australian newspapers were $1,197 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $82 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2018 revenues of $1,279 million. The impact of foreign currency

 fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $99 million, or 7%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Advertising revenues decreased $65 million, primarily due to the $56 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $52 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market, partially offset by the $26 million increase due to digital advertising growth and a $20 million increase from the acquisition of an integrated content marketing agency. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $21 million primarily due to the $32 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and print volume declines, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, cover price increases and digital subscriber growth.  

News UK  

Revenues were $1,032 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $44 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2018 revenues of $1,076 million. The decrease was due in part to lower Advertising revenues of $28 million, primarily due to weakness in the print advertising market and the $12 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $27 million, primarily due to single-copy volume declines, mainly at The Sun, and the $22 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the impact of cover price increases across mastheads. The decrease was partially offset by higher Other revenues of $11 million, mainly due to the $38 million net benefit related to the exit from the partnership for Sun Bets in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, partially offset by lower brand partnership revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $40 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

News America Marketing  

Revenues at News America Marketing were $895 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of $61 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2018 revenues of $956 million. The decrease was primarily related to $67 million of lower home delivered revenues, which include free-standing insert products, mainly due to lower volume.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment increased $1,198 million and Segment EBITDA increased $207 million, as compared to fiscal 2018. The revenue and Segment EBITDA increases were primarily due to the Transaction, which contributed $1,289 million of revenue and $236 million of Segment EBITDA during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $74 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.

Book Publishing (17% and 19% of the Companys consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, revenues at the Book Publishing segment decreased $4 million as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the $65 million impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, the absence of $28 million in revenues from the sublicensing agreement for J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings trilogy recognized in fiscal 2018 and the $27 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. These decreases were partially offset by strong frontlist and backlist sales in the Christian publishing category, primarily titles by Rachel Hollis including Girl, Wash Your Face and Girl, Stop Apologizing, as well as the success of Homebody: A Guide to Creating Spaces You Never Want to Leave by Joanna Gaines in the general books category and The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas in the childrens books category. Digital sales increased 7% compared to fiscal 2018, driven by growth in downloadable audiobook sales, and represented 20% of Consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, Segment EBITDA at the Book Publishing segment increased $14 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the mix of titles.  

Digital Real Estate Services (12% and 13% of the Companys consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased $18 million, or 2%, as compared to fiscal 2018. Revenues at Move increased $32 million, or 7%, to $484 million in fiscal 2019 from $452 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher Real Estate revenues resulting from growth in leads and higher yield, partially offset by lower non-listing advertising revenues. At REA Group, revenues increased $8 million, or 1%, to $674 million in fiscal 2019 from $666 million in fiscal 2018. The higher revenues were primarily due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue driven by price increases, improved penetration and favorable product mix, as well as the acquisition of Hometrack Australia, partially offset by the $56 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in listing volumes which

 are not expected to improve in the short term. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the $21 million impact resulting from the sale of DIAKRIT during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segment decreased $17 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in Segment EBITDA was primarily due to the $39 million impact associated with the acquisition and continued investment in Opcity at Move and the $30 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the higher revenues noted above.

Results of OperationsFiscal 2019 (as reported) versus Fiscal 2018 (pro forma)  

The following supplemental unaudited pro forma information for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 reflects the Companys results of operations as if the Transaction had occurred on July 1, 2016. The Company believes that the presentation of this supplemental information enhances comparability across the reporting periods. The information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and is based on historical results of operations of News Corp and Foxtel, adjusted for the effect of Transaction-related accounting adjustments, as described below. Pro forma adjustments were based on available information and assumptions regarding impacts that are directly attributable to the Transaction, are factually supportable, and are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. In addition, the pro forma information is provided for supplemental and informational purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of what the Companys results of operations would have been, or the Companys future results of operations, had the Transaction actually occurred on the date indicated. As only the financial results for the Subscription Video Services segment were adjusted due to the presentation of this pro forma supplemental information, the Company is only providing a supplemental analysis for this segment below, under Segment Analysis (pro forma). The unaudited pro forma information should be read in conjunction with other sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Notes to the unaudited pro forma statements:  

 (a)  

Reflects the historical results of operations of News Corporation. As the acquisition of a controlling interest in Foxtel was completed on April 3, 2018, Foxtel is reflected in our historical Statement of Operations from April 3, 2018 onwards.  

 (b)  

Reflects the historical results of operations of Foxtel to the date of the Transaction. From April 3, 2018 onwards, Foxtel is included in the historical results of operations of News Corporation. The Statement of Operations of Foxtel is derived from its historical financial statements for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The Statement of Operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 reflects Foxtels Statement of Operations on a U.S. GAAP basis and translated from Australian dollars to U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the combined group, using the quarterly average rate for each quarter in the period presented. Additionally, certain balances within Foxtels historical financial information were reclassified to be consistent with the Companys presentation.  

 (c)  

Represents the impact of eliminating transactions between Foxtel and the consolidated subsidiaries of News Corporation, which would be eliminated upon consolidation as a result of the Transaction.  

 (d)  

Reflects the reversal of revenue recognized in Foxtels historical Statement of Operations resulting from the fair value adjustment of Foxtels historical deferred installation revenue in the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Transaction.  

 (e)  

Reflect the adjustment to amortization of program inventory recognized in Foxtels historical Statement of Operations related to the fair value adjustment of Foxtels historical program inventory in the preliminary purchase price allocation.  

 (f)  

Reflects the removal of transaction expenses directly related to the Transaction that are included in News Corps historical Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. These costs are considered to be non-recurring in nature, and as such, have been excluded from the pro forma Statement of Operations.  

 (g)  

Reflects the adjustment to amortization expense resulting from the recognition of amortizable intangible assets in the preliminary purchase price allocation.  

 (h)  

Reflects the adjustment to depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustment to Foxtels historical fixed assets in the preliminary purchase price allocation, which resulted in a step-up in the value of such assets.  

 (i)  

Reflects the reversal of amortization expense included in News Corps historical Statement of Operations from the Companys settlement of its pre-existing contractual arrangement between Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia, which resulted in a write-off of its channel distribution agreement intangible asset at the time of the Transaction.  

 (j)  

Represents the impact to equity losses of affiliates as a result of the Transaction, as if the Transaction occurred on July 1, 2016. Historically News Corp accounted for its investment in Foxtel under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the Transaction, Foxtel became a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, and therefore, the impact of Foxtel on the Companys historical equity losses of affiliates was eliminated. In addition, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, News Corp recorded an impairment to its investment in Foxtel within equity losses of affiliates which is reflected in News Corps historical results. As this impairment is non-recurring in nature and is not directly attributable to the Transaction, such amount has not been eliminated and has been reclassified in the pro forma Statement of Operations from equity losses of affiliates into impairment and restructuring charges.

 (l)  

In determining the tax rate to apply to our pro forma adjustments we used the Australian statutory rate of 30%, which is the jurisdiction in which the business operates. However, in certain instances, the effective tax rate applied to certain adjustments differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of certain valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, based on the Companys historical tax profile in Australia.

Revenues (pro forma)Revenues decreased $490 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The Revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a $342 million decrease in revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment, primarily due to the $181 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower subscription revenues resulting from lower broadcast subscribers and changes in the subscriber package mix, partially offset by $46 million of higher revenues from Foxtel Now and Kayo, as well as lower revenues at the News and Information Services segment of $163 million, mainly due to the $154 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, weakness in the print advertising market and lower revenues at News America Marketing of $61 million, partially offset by cover and subscription price increases and digital subscriber growth, primarily at The Wall Street Journal and in Australia. The Revenue decrease was partially offset by higher revenues of $18 million at the Digital Real Estate Services segment. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard resulted in a Revenue decrease of approximately $72 million. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Revenue decrease of $418 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

Operating expenses (pro forma)Operating expenses decreased $126 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in Operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was mainly due to the $219 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by $95 million of higher sports programming and production costs at the Subscription Video Services segment, mainly related to Cricket Australia and the National Rugby League. During fiscal 2019, as a result of Foxtel managements new programming strategy, the Company determined that certain entertainment programming provided a higher benefit upon its first run and now accelerates amortization for such programming. The Company expects an increase in non-cash programming amortization expense in fiscal 2020 as a result.

Selling, general and administrative (pro forma)Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $165 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower expenses at the Subscription Video Services segment of $154 million primarily related to lower customer service and installation costs and lower overhead costs, partially offset by the absence of the $46 million impact from the reversal of a portion of the previously accrued liability for the U.K. Newspaper Matters and the corresponding receivable as the result of an agreement reached with the relevant tax authority with respect to certain employment taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $130 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

Depreciation and amortization (pro forma)Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $17 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $32 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

Impairment and restructuring charges (pro forma)During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $92 million and $76 million, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits in the News and Information Services segment.  

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $96 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.  

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1,237 million consisting primarily of a $957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its investment in Foxtel and $280 million primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the News America Marketing reporting unit and impairment of goodwill at the FOX SPORTS Australia reporting unit.  

Equity losses of affiliates (pro forma)Equity losses of affiliates improved by $10 million to $17 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 from $27 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in losses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to the absence of $13 million in non-cash write-downs of certain equity method investments recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  

Interest expense, net (pro forma)Interest expense, net decreased $24 million, or 29%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower third party interest expense due to repayments of maturing facilities.  

Other, net (pro forma)Other, net increased $22 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to dividends received from certain investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and gain recognized on the sale of property in Australia, partially offset by the absence of the gain recognized on the sale of the Companys investment in SEEKAsia in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  

Income tax expense (pro forma)The Companys income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were $126 million and 36%, respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $373 million and (58%), respectively, for fiscal 2018.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of $126 million on pre-tax income of $354 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The  

59   

Table of Contents 

 higher tax rate was primarily due to lower tax benefits on impairments, valuation allowances being recorded against tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions with operating losses and the impact from foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a tax expense of $373 million on pre-tax loss of $645 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The lower tax rate was primarily due to $340 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs of approximately $1.3 billion and a tax expense of $237 million related to the impact of the Tax Act, offset by a tax benefit of approximately $49 million related to the settlement of pre-Separation tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service.  

Net income (loss) (pro forma)Net income (loss) improved by $1,269 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower impairment and restructuring charges resulting from the absence of $1,237 million of non-cash impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2018 consisting of a $957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Companys investment in Foxtel and $280 million primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the News America Marketing reporting unit and impairment of goodwill at the FOX SPORTS Australia reporting unit and the absence of the $237 million negative impact of the Tax Act recognized in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower Total Segment EBITDA.  

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (pro forma)Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $23 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower performance at Foxtel, partially offset by higher results at REA Group.

Subscription Video Services (pro forma) (22% and 24% of the Companys consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment decreased $342 million, or 13%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The revenue decrease was primarily due to the $181 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower subscription revenues resulting from lower broadcast subscribers and changes in the subscriber package mix, partially offset by $46 million of higher revenues from Foxtel Now and Kayo.  

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, Segment EBITDA at the Subscription Video Services segment decreased $165 million, or 30%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in Segment EBITDA was primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above, $95 million of higher sports programming and production costs, mainly related to Cricket Australia and the National Rugby League, and approximately $30 million in higher marketing costs related to Kayo, partially offset by lower entertainment programming costs, customer service and installation costs and overhead expenses.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Current Financial Condition  

The Companys principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of June 30, 2019, the Companys cash and cash equivalents were $1.64 billion. The Company expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future, including repayment of indebtedness. The Company also has available borrowing capacity under the Facility (as defined below) and  

61   

Table of Contents 

 certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) the Companys credit rating or absence of a credit rating and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents, (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets and (v) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.  

As of June 30, 2019, the Companys consolidated assets included $633 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, $97 million is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Groups cash balance. The Company earns income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings. Should the Company require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by and/or available to its domestic operations, the Company could elect to transfer funds held in foreign jurisdictions. The transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may be cumbersome due to local regulations, foreign exchange controls and taxes. Additionally, the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the Company. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. As part of the transition to the new partial territorial tax system, the Tax Act imposed a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The deemed repatriation tax was determined to be approximately $26 million, which was recorded to income tax expense in fiscal 2018. The U.S. Treasury Department released additional guidance and proposed regulations during the past year. The Company undertook a review of the guidance and proposed regulations and determined that there were no material changes to the deemed repatriation tax of approximately $26 million.  

The principal uses of cash that affect the Companys liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs and paper purchases; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; and the repayment of debt and related interest. In addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the Companys securities or the assumption of indebtedness.  

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  

In May 2013, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board of Directors) authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of its Class A Common Stock. No stock repurchases were made during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Through August 5, 2019, the Company cumulatively repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $71 million. The remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of August 5, 2019 was approximately $429 million. All decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the Board of Directors and management. The committees decisions regarding future stock repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the Companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. The stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.

Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow Available to News Corporation  

Free cash flow available to News Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures (free cash flow), less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group. Free cash flow available to News Corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow available to News Corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.  

The Company considers free cash flow available to News Corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the Companys balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Companys business, strategic acquisitions, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. The Company believes excluding REA Groups free cash flow and including dividends received from REA Group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Groups cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Companys free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Companys unadjusted free cash flow.  

A limitation of free cash flow available to News Corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporate all cash movements during the period.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to News Corporation:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Free cash flow available to News Corporation decreased $36 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 to $213 million from $249 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash provided by operating activities as discussed above.  

Borrowings  

As of June 30, 2019, the Company had total borrowings of $1.45 billion, including the current portion. The Companys borrowings as of such date reflect $1.24 billion of outstanding debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Foxtel (together with Foxtel, the Foxtel Debt Group) that the Company consolidated upon completion of the Transaction. The Foxtel Debt Group indebtedness includes U.S. private placement senior unsecured notes and drawn amounts under its revolving credit facilities, with maturities ranging from fiscal 2020 to 2025. Approximately $281 million and $337 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Foxtel Debt Group indebtedness will mature during fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively, and these debt repayments are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of cash on hand and debt refinancing. The Foxtel Debt Groups borrowings are guaranteed by certain members of the Foxtel Debt Group. In accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations (ASC 805), these debt instruments were recorded at fair value as of the Transaction date. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Foxtel Debt Group had repayments of $1.03 billion, including the repayment of its A$300 million (approximately $216 million) facility maturing in April 2019 and the repayment of its A$200 million (approximately $139 million) facility maturing in May 2019, and borrowings of $681 million. The repayments of the A$300 million facility maturing in April 2019 and the A$200 million facility maturing in May 2019 were repaid using A$500 million of shareholder loans provided by the Company. The shareholder loans bear interest at a variable rate of Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin ranging from 6.30% to 7.75%. The shareholder loans mature in December 2027.  

The Companys borrowings as of June 30, 2019 also reflect the indebtedness of REA Group. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, REA Group repaid $87 million (A$120 million) for its unsecured loan facility due December 2018. REA Group had remaining borrowings of $217 million, of which approximately $168 million (A$240 million) will mature in December 2019. The Company expects REA Group to fund this debt repayment primarily through a combination of cash on hand and debt refinancing.  

The Company has additional borrowing capacity under its unsecured $650 million revolving credit facility (the Facility), which can be increased up to a maximum amount of $900 million at the Companys request. The lenders commitments to make the Facility available terminate on October 23, 2020, provided the Company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances for up to two additional one-year periods. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not borrowed any funds under the Facility. In addition, the Company has $181 million of undrawn commitments under the Foxtel Groups revolving credit facilities.  

The Companys borrowings contain customary representations, covenants and events of default. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2019.

Commitments  

The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (firm commitments) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations.  

The following table summarizes the Companys material firm commitments as of June 30, 2019:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

The Company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees, printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.  

 (b)  

The Company has sports programming rights commitments with the National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, domestic football league and Australian Rugby Union as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2024.  

 (c)  

The Company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content.  

 (d)  

The Company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants, satellite services and equipment. These leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2021. This amount includes approximately $45 million of office facilities that have been subleased from Fox Corporation.  

 (e)  

The Company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services. The transponder services arrangements extend through 2029 and are accounted for as operating leases.  

 (f)  

See Note 9Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (g)  

Reflects the Companys expected future interest payments on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at June 30, 2019. Such rates are subject to change in future periods. See Note 9Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the Company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. Since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the Companys total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.  

The table also excludes the Companys pension obligations, other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to

Table of Contents 

 reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. The Company made contributions of $16 million and $29 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements. The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2020, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Companys expected returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. Payments due to participants under the Companys pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. Payments due under the Companys OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Companys OPEB plans. The Company expects its OPEB payments to approximate $9 million in fiscal 2020. See Note 17Retirement Benefit Obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Contingencies  

The Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in Note 16Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.  

The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. See Note 16Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Companys tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Companys tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company. See Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Long-lived assets  

The Companys long-lived assets include goodwill, finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment.  

67   

Table of Contents 

Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of long-lived assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. The Company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.  

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets  

The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.  

Under ASC 350, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach.  

Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as part of the Companys long-range planning process, the Company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.  

The performance of the Companys annual impairment analysis resulted in $87 million of impairments to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2019 primarily related to goodwill at a reporting unit within the News and Information Services segment. The fair values of the Companys reporting units in fiscal 2019 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0% to 54%. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from 9.0% to 25.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 0.0% to 3.0%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.5%-6.0%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from 5%-10%). Significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.  

As of June 30, 2019, the News and Information Services and Subscription Video Services segments had reporting units with goodwill of approximately $2.0 billion that is at-risk for future impairment, of which $0.1 billion relates to the News and Information Services segment and $1.9 billion relates to the Subscription Video Services segment. The fair values of these reporting units with goodwill at risk exceeded their respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0% to 5%. Significant unobservable inputs  

68   

Table of Contents 

 utilized in the income approach valuation method for at-risk reporting units were discount rates (ranging from 10.25% to 20%) and long-term growth rates (ranging from 1.1% to 2.0%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method for at-risk reporting units were EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and a control premium of 10%. Any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the News and Information Services segment and the Subscription Video Services segment failing the fiscal 2019 impairment analysis, which would have required the company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value. The Company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment.  

Property, Plant and Equipment  

The Company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). An asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include, among other things, material declines in operating performance, significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group.  

In determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, the Company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group. The estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance, market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset. If all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be non-recoverable, the Company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset groups carrying value and its fair value. The Company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. Typical assumptions applied when using a market-based approach include projected EBITDA and related multiples. Typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. All of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results.  

Programming Costs  

Costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 920, EntertainmentBroadcasters. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program. The pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors. If initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership an accelerated method of amortization is used. The Company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively. The Company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect net realizable value. Changes in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value. The Company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events. The costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired. For sports contracts with dedicated channels, the Company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months.  

Income Taxes  

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. Tax laws are  

69   

Table of Contents 

 complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under ASC 740, Income Taxes.  

The Companys annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Companys net deferred tax assets, if any. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. The Companys actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the Companys forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Although the Company believes current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.  

The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. The Companys policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of Income tax (expense) benefit.  

Retirement Benefit Obligations  

The Companys employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries. See Note 17Retirement Benefit Obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by GAAP. The measurement and recognition of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. Net periodic benefit costs (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates. Current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolios past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 4.6% for fiscal 2020 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 23% equities, 68% fixed-income securities and 9% cash and other investments.  

The Company recorded ($2) million and $3 million in net periodic benefit (income) costs in the Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company utilizes the full yield-curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  

Although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 2.7% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit costs (income). The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the Companys annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be  

70   

Table of Contents 

 effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the Companys expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. The weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date.  

The key assumptions used in developing the Companys fiscal 2019 and 2018 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 4.6% for fiscal 2020 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. The accumulated net pre-tax losses on the Companys pension plans as of June 30, 2019 were approximately $484 million which increased from approximately $442 million for the Companys pension plans as of June 30, 2018. This increase of $42 million was primarily due to decreased discount rates. Lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the Companys deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. Higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the Companys accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with ASC 715, CompensationRetirement Benefits. Unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.  

The Company made contributions of $16 million and $29 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Companys expected plan returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2020. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. See Note 18Other Postretirement Benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

71

Changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Companys pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:
