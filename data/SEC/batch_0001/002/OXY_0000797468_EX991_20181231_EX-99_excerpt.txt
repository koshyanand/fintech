Ladies and Gentlemen:

At your request, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2018, based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on February 6, 2019 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations. 

Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2018. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

Properties Reviewed

The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the states of New Mexico and Texas and derived through Occidental’s economic interest as defined in contractual arrangements for certain properties located in the Middle East. 

The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental. Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental’s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page. At Occidental’s request and provided by Occidental, we have also presented the portion of the total company net proved reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels. All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an “as sold” basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located. Reserves reviewed and noted herein on a BOE basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one BOE. It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a BOE basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and for a number of years.

Reserves Process Review Discussion

A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is “the result of an investigation by a person who is qualified by experience and training equivalent to that of a Reserves Auditor to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity’s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.”

In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental’s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit. Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes “the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, [and] (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.” 

Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to “the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information” as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit. Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.

Applicable Petroleum Reserves Definitions

RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS

Page 3

The determination of the proved reserves classifications as discussed herein are based on the definitions as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197. 

Reserves and Uncertainty

The SEC defines reserves as the “estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.” All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability. 

In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are “much more likely to be achieved than not.” The SEC defines probable reserves as “those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.” The SEC defines possible reserves as “those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.” All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.

The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities. Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty. At Occidental’s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.

Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that “as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.” Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.

Reserves Process Review Procedure

Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental’s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2018; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2018 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed. We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review. Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto. 

Methodology and Procedure Employed by Occidental for Estimating Reserves

The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy. These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.

The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy or a combination of methods. Approximately 99 percent of the proved developed producing reserves (attributable to producing wells or reservoirs) for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis, reservoir modeling, and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The remaining 1 percent of the proved developed producing reserves (attributable to the producing wells or reservoirs) for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery. The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 

All of the proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends.  Approximately 84 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends and/or reservoir simulation. The remaining 16 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including volumetrics and type curves (supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above). The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.

Of the properties reviewed, approximately 1 percent of the proved producing reserves and 2 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserves volumes are related to the application of enhanced/improved recovery techniques. These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO2 injection and infill drilling.

Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process. Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates. The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 

Primary Economic Assumptions Employed by Occidental for Estimating Reserves

To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.

The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2018 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.

The table below summarizes Occidental’s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental’s “average realized prices.” The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental’s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental’s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area. A summary of average realized prices are not included for properties located in the Middle East because of host government’s limitations on the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.

As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as “differentials.” The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data. We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental. 

While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review.

Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed. The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate.

Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs. The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements. The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental. 

Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental. 

The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental’s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2018. The implementation of Occidental’s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental’s management. As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental’s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level. In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental. Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any existing laws or regulations that would require the company to significantly alter their current development plans. While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2018, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.

Future Production Rate Assumptions Employed by Occidental for Estimating Reserves

Occidental’s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves. If

RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS

Occidental Petroleum Corporation

Page 7

 a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates. 

Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental’s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies. 

The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.

Reserves Derived by Occidental Through Certain Production Sharing Contracts

The reserves for certain properties located in the Middle East reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production. Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes. The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts. Occidental’s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in the Middle East include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental). Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information. Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental’s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.

Possible Effects of Regulation on Occidental’s Estimate of Reserves

Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests. Occidental’s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein.

We have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.

Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any existing laws or regulations that would materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us.

Data Reviewed in Conducting the Third Party Reserves Process Review

Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review. In conducting our process review of Occidental’s estimates of proved reserves and forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental. We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations. 

Reserves Process Review Opinion

We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties. Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail.

We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.

Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2018. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS

As Adapted From:

RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

PREAMBLE

On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule”, including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the “SEC regulations”. The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).

Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in §229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.

Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.

Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.

Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. 

RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS

Page 2

Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale. 

Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 

Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)

Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:

Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)

Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:

Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: 

(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 

(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.

(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 

(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)

Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:

Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: 

(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and 

(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions)

While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.

Developed Producing Reserves 

Developed Producing Reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate.

Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 

Developed Non-Producing

Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. 

Shut-In

Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from:

(1)completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing; 

(2)wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or 

(3)wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. 

Behind-Pipe

Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. 

In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)

Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:

Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 

(i)Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 

(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 

(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
