Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Instrument Market Risk

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.

Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors, that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer monitor risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.

Commodity Price Risk

We sell into and receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined petroleum product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets, exposing our revenues, purchases, cost of operating activities, and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, our Commercial organization uses derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to fluctuating market prices. Conversely, our Commercial organization also uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain, and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices:

•Balance physical systems or to meet our refinery requirements and marketing demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity.

•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power transactions.

•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.

We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018, as derivative instruments. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.

Interest Rate Risk

Our use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.

Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following:

•Fluctuations in NGL, crude oil, refined petroleum product and natural gas prices and refining, marketing and petrochemical margins.

•Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance.

•Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating our facilities or transporting our products.

•Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemical products.

•Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our NGL, crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products.
