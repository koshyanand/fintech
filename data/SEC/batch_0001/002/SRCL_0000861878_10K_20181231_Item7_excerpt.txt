Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion of Stericycle’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report. 

Overview 

Stericycle is a multinational business-to-business services provider with a core purpose to help our customers fulfill their promise by providing solutions that protect people and brands, promote health, and safeguard the environment. We are focused on driving long-term growth, profitability, and delivering enhanced shareholder value and operate in highly regulated markets which, we believe will continue to grow as a result of a number of factors (see Part I – Item 1. Business). We aim to take advantage of that growth both organically, by focusing on enhancing our service offerings and platforms, and by acquisitions in what we believe are highly fragmented industries. We serve customers in all 50 states of the United States (“U.S.”), Puerto Rico, and in 21 other countries. As part of our business strategy, in the third quarter of 2017, we initiated a comprehensive multi-year Business Transformation (see below). 

For further information on the Company’s business, segments, and services, see Part I, Item 1. Business. 

Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year include: 

•  

Revenues of $3.49 billion, a decrease of 2.6%, driven by the expected declines in the small quantity (“SQ”) medical waste business and Communication and Related Services (“CRS”), foreign exchange, and divestitures, partially offset by strong organic growth in Secure Information Destruction. 

•  

Gross profit of $1.38 billion, a decrease of 5.9%, primarily attributable to the expected impact of SQ mix and pricing, non-cash impairment charges and the impact of lower call volumes and smaller recall events in CRS. We also continue to see challenges with our Latin America business as a result of prolonged market declines and cost pressures.  

•  

Loss per share of $2.91, due to $358.7 million in non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to CRS and Latin America reporting units, and other items discussed further below. 

During the third quarter of 2018, we funded the $295.0 million SQ medical waste customer class action settlement (the “SQ settlement”). We announced during the fourth quarter of 2018 that we had reached a proposed resolution with Plaintiffs and their counsel in the pending Securities Class Action Lawsuit. (For additional information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 19 – Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

We entered into several amendments to the Credit Agreement, which cover our senior credit facility and term loan, and the various note purchase agreements which cover the private placement notes. These amendments adjusted the definition of EBITDA for purposes of the calculation of, and allowed for an increase in, the permitted Consolidated Leverage Ratio. In addition, terms were added which, under certain circumstances, would lead to increases in the interest rates charged on the senior credit facility, term loan and private placement notes. In connection with the underlying terms, we saw an increase of 0.25% in the interest rate charged on our senior credit facility and term loan and total increases of 0.75%

on the interest rates charged on our private placement notes. We expect that the annual impact of these interest rate increases on our Interest Expense, Net will be approximately $11.8 million. (For additional information, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 8 – Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Finally, in September 2018, our Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) was converted, in accordance with the terms of issue, into a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock (for additional information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 14 – Preferred Stock in the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

The following table identifies key strategies and other significant matters impacting our business for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively (amounts are stated pre-tax except when noted):

Business Transformation 

The Business Transformation is based on a strategic vision to build a best-in-class enterprise performance management (“EPM”) operating model to enable the Company to operate more efficiently, provide an enhanced experience to customers, better capitalize on future growth opportunities and establish greater controls and oversight to drive more consistent results. Additionally, a key component to the Business Transformation is the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system which will leverage standard processes throughout the organization to accelerate decision making, expedite acquisition integration, remediate compliance and control issues, and enable real-time analytics. 

Key initiatives of the Business Transformation include: 

•  

Portfolio Rationalization: Executing on a comprehensive review of the Company’s global service lines to identify and pursue the divestiture of non-strategic assets (see divestitures section, below for decision criteria and divestiture related charges). 

•  

Operational Optimization: Standardizing route planning logistics, modernizing field operations, and driving network efficiency across facilities. 

•  

Organizational Excellence and Efficiency: Redesigning the Company’s organizational structure to optimize resources and align around a global shared business services model. 

•  

Commercial Excellence: Aligning our sales and service organizations around the customer, standardizing our customer relationship management process, and expanding customer self-service options. 

•  

Strategic Sourcing: Reducing spend through global procure-to-pay processes and leveraging organizational scale.

PART II 

Execution of the Business Transformation began in 2017 with the identification and validation of key transformational opportunities as well as an organizational restructuring which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017. Execution of the Business Transformation is expected to continue through 2022 with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system in the U.S. and Canada during 2020 with remaining international rollouts beginning in 2021. 

On August 2, 2018, we announced, as part of the Portfolio Rationalization strategy within Business Transformation, that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for non-core CRS, demonstrating our commitment to streamlining our portfolio. The process, which is being conducted with the assistance of financial and legal advisers, is considering a range of strategic alternatives for CRS, including a divestiture, with a focus on pursuing the outcome that will drive the most value for Stericycle shareholders. There can be no assurances as to the form or timing of any transaction or if any transaction will be consummated. Any potential gain or loss will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to identify an appropriate strategic alternative, reach a mutual agreement with any counterparty and satisfy the closing conditions associated with any proposed transaction. 

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and since the program’s inception, we have recognized the following charges and capital expenditures related to the Business Transformation: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company expects to incur additional aggregate charges over the duration of Business Transformation, principally aligned with the ERP implementation timeline discussed above. The amount, timing and recognition of additional charges over this time period will be affected by the nature of spending and the occurrence of commitments and triggering events as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), among other factors. The asset impairment charges are non-cash, and the remaining charges are cash costs primarily expensed or capitalized as incurred. 

2018 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 42   

PART II 

The Company may incur more charges and cash expenditures than estimated and may not realize the expected improvement or cost savings on its planned time frame or at all. 

The non-cash charges incurred in the year ended December 31, 2018 are discussed in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 5 – Property, Plant And Equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements We may incur additional non-cash impairment and/or accelerated depreciation charges as we continue to evolve our future information technology strategy in conjunction with our ERP implementation.  

Business Transformation charges by reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Business Transformation charges by reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As part of our Business Transformation we are undertaking legal entity organizational restructuring actions to assist with streamlining and simplifying business operations and to help lower general and administrative costs. Such actions could result in additional charges associated with consulting and professional services, and increases in potential exposure to U.S. and foreign taxes and foreign exchange charges. 

Intangible Amortization 

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company recognized $130.3 million, $118.4 million, and $129.3 million, respectively, of intangible amortization expense. The increase is partially due to the adjustment of the estimated useful lives of some of our customer relationship intangibles (see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements) during 2018 with the remaining change arising from acquisitions. 

Acquisition and Integration 

We believe that acquisitions are a steady and efficient way to scale operations, build critical customer density for transportation and treatment operations, and enter new markets or geographies, as well as provide opportunity to introduce our additional services to the acquired customers. We expect to continue our acquisition strategy, remaining focused on small, highly accretive, tuck in acquisitions that broaden our various service capabilities while creating value for our shareholders.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Integration expenses incurred in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 primarily related to acquisitions completed in the U.S. and the fourth quarter 2015 Shred-it® acquisition. 

Operational Optimization  

The Company aims to achieve a culture of continuous improvement that will enhance its efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness to improve its cost base and cash flow. As part of its strategy, the Company has taken a number of actions to reduce operating costs and optimize operations. For example, we believe plant throughput and route density are competitive strengths of Stericycle. We maintain such strengths by making adjustments to our network of transportation and treatment facilities to optimize overall logistics and processing capabilities within a service line while reducing operational costs. As part of these efforts, we seek to reduce network redundancies by consolidating facilities, closing the redundant facility, and restructuring the local organization and operation for efficiency. 

Projects that are included within the Operational Optimization category were generally commenced prior to the announcement of our Business Transformation initiative discussed above or have been identified as additional items over and above those related to Business Transformation. 

Operational Optimization expenses, which were all recognized in SG&A, for the year ended December 31, 2018, were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Domestic and Canada RCS Closure and exit costs - other related to optimizing overall logistics and sales functions and lease exit costs for the consolidation of call centers in Canada Communication and Related Services locations and non-cash charges relate to accelerated depreciation associated with software;

As the Company continues to consider each continuous improvement activity, the amount, the timing and recognition of charges will be affected by the occurrence of commitments and triggering events as defined under GAAP, among other factors. The Company may incur more charges and cash expenditures than estimated and may not realize the expected improvement or cost savings on its planned time frame or at all. 

Divestitures 

The Company evaluates its portfolio of services on an ongoing basis with a country-by-country and service line-by-service line approach to assess long-term potential and identify potential business candidates for divestiture. Our decision for divestiture is based upon the following criteria: 

•  

outlook for long-term market conditions,  

•  

potential impact to complimentary services or customer relationships,  

•  

ability to leverage infrastructure and customer base for growth,  

•  

potential for margin improvement, 

•  

current divestiture value versus future divestiture value, 

•  

return on invested capital, and 

•  

implications for ERP system implementation. 

During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized charges totaling $12.8 million, $9.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively, associated with the divestitures of businesses. Details of divestitures undertaken in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 can be found in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 4 – Restructuring, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to these charges, in 2018 we incurred $7.7 million of consulting and professional fees associated with our Portfolio Rationalization efforts, primarily the review of strategic alternatives for CRS. 

With the anticipated implementation of its ERP system, Stericycle will continue its strategic portfolio review with the intent of identifying additional non-strategic service lines or markets for divestiture prior to the implementation of the ERP system.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $3.8 million, in Other expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income, related to the re-measurement of net monetary assets held in Argentina as a result of its designation as a highly inflationary economy. 

Capital Allocation 

Stericycle aims to maintain a structured capital allocation strategy that balances investment in the business, debt reduction, and returns to shareholders. 

Our capital allocation items include the following types of activities: 

•  

Stock issuance costs, 

•  

Dividends on Preferred Stock,

PART II 

Tax Reform 

The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and introduced changes including, but are not limited to, a corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. 

The Company calculated the provisional impact of the Tax Act on its year end 2017 income tax benefit/provision and as a result recognized $129.8 million as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), the impact was finalized during 2018, resulting in a charge of $8.8 million. Adjustments may be necessary in future periods due to potential technical corrections to the Tax Act and/or regulatory guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. For further discussion, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 9 – Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues: In analyzing our Company’s performance, it is necessary to understand that our various regulated services share a common infrastructure and customer base. We market our regulated and compliance services by offering various pricing options to meet our customers’ preferences, and customers move between these different billing paradigms. For example, our customers may contract with us for Medical Waste Disposal services that are billed based on the weight of waste collected, processed and disposed during a particular period, and in a subsequent period, the same customer could move to our standard service, which packages the same regulated medical waste services with training and education services for a contracted subscription fee. Another example is a customer that purchases our Medical Waste Disposal and Sharps Disposal Management services which provides the customer with the same regulated services under a different pricing and billing arrangement.

PART II 

We do not track the movement of customers between the various types of regulated services we offer. Although we can identify directional trends in our services, because the regulated services are similar in nature and there are inherent inaccuracies in disaggregation, we analyze revenues on an aggregated basis. We analyze our revenue growth by identifying changes related to organic growth, acquisitions, divestitures and changes due to currency exchange fluctuations. Organic growth excludes the effect of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full year of revenues in the comparative period. 

Year over year movements in Revenues by Service and Segment in 2018 compared to 2017, and 2017 compared to 2016 were as follows:

2018 compared to 2017 

On a consolidated basis revenues decreased $94.8 million, or 2.6%, in 2018 to $3.49 billion from $3.58 billion in 2017. The decrease was largely driven by the expected declines in the SQ medical waste business and CRS, foreign exchange, and divestitures, partially offset by strong organic growth in Secure Information Destruction. 

Domestic and Canada RCS revenues increased $22.2 million, or 0.9%, in 2018 to $2.57 billion from $2.55 billion in 2017. Organic revenues declined $1.5 million, or 0.1%, as we saw declines due to the impact of SQ pricing. This was partially offset by increases in Secure Information Destruction revenues as a result of increased pricing and related demand and pricing for recycled paper as well as organic growth from new customers and growth in Regulated Waste and Compliance revenues from retail and our larger customers. Acquisitions contributed $27.0 million, or 1.1%, to revenues. Divestitures, primarily related to the U.S. clean room business, reduced revenues by $3.3 million, or 0.1%. 

International RCS revenue decreased $52.5 million, or 7.4%, in 2018 to $655.1 million from $707.6 million in 2017. The increase in International RCS segment organic revenues was $13.3 million, or 1.9%. Secure Information Destruction revenues increased as a result of increased pricing and related demand and pricing for recycled paper as well as organic growth from new customers, and the impact of the new General Data Protection Regulation laws in Europe. We also saw increases in Medical Waste and Compliance Revenues as a result of growth in Europe. These increases were offset by declines due to the exit from our patient transport business in the U.K. and overall economic declines in several Latin America markets. Acquisitions in the International RCS segment contributed $2.7 million, or 0.4%, to revenues. Divestitures related to the hazardous waste business in the U.K. and Secure Information Destruction business in South Africa reduced revenues by $41.7 million, or 5.9%. The effect of foreign exchange rates, primarily in Latin America, unfavorably impacted international revenues in 2018 by $26.8 million, or 3.8%, as foreign currencies, notably those in Latin America, declined against the U.S. dollar. 

All Other revenues, related to Domestic Communication and Related Services, decreased $64.5 million, or 20.1%, in 2018 to $256.7 million from $321.2 million in 2017. Revenues were impacted by reductions in CRS volumes due to smaller-sized recall events as compared to multiple large-sized recall events managed during 2017 and lower call volumes.  

2017 compared to 2016 

On a consolidated basis revenues increased $18.4 million, or 0.5%, in 2017 to $3.58 billion from $3.56 billion in 2016. 

Domestic and Canada RCS revenues increased $43.1 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 to $2.55 billion from $2.51 billion in 2016. Organic revenue growth contributed $19.0 million, or 0.8%, and acquisitions contributed $20.9 million, or 0.8%, to revenues. Our Secure Information Destruction revenues were strong due to higher sales activity for both recurring and one-time purge services combined with higher recycling revenue. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar had a favorable impact on 2017 revenues by $3.2 million, or 0.1%. Revenue related to Manufacturing and Industrial services (“M&I”) experienced a decline of $19.7 million from 2016, which reduced overall organic growth by 0.9%. This decline was due to lower activity from on-call services related to softness in the U.S. industrial market. In addition, we have experienced pricing pressure related to our SQ regulated waste and compliance customers resulting from hospital consolidation of physician practices and increased competitive activities in the market.

PART II 

International RCS revenue decreased $44.1 million, or 5.9%, in 2017 to $707.6 million from $751.7 million in 2016. 2017 organic revenue decline in the International RCS segment was $13.4 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to exiting certain patient transport service contracts in the U.K. and a decline in M&I revenue in our Latin American business. Acquisitions in the International RCS segment contributed $6.4 million, or 0.9% to revenues. Divestitures related to the sale of certain assets in the U.K. reduced revenues by $21.6 million, or 2.9%. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in a 2.0% decrease in revenues in 2017. The effect of foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted international revenues in 2017 by $15.5 million, or 2.1%, as foreign currencies declined against the U.S. dollar. 

All Other revenues, related to Domestic Communication and Related Services, increased $19.4 million, or 6.4%, in 2017 to $321.2 million from $301.8 million in 2016. Organic revenue increased $14.5 million, or 4.8%, primarily due to serving new brands across many industries and several larger non-recurring recall events in 2017. Acquisitions contributed $4.9 million, or 1.6%. 

Gross Profit:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated Gross profit decreased $86.5 million, or 5.9%, in 2018 to $1.38 billion from $1.46 billion in 2017. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated Gross profit decreased to 39.5% in 2018 compared to 40.8% in 2017. The decline in gross profit was primarily attributable to the expected impact of SQ mix and pricing, approximately $25.7 million of non-cash impairment charges incurred in the Domestic and Canada RCS and All Other reportable segments and the impact of lower volumes in CRS. Decreases were also due to a prolonged declining market trend and cost pressures in Latin America. 

Consolidated Gross profit decreased $24.4 million, or 1.6%, in 2017 to $1.46 billion from $1.49 billion in 2016. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated Gross profit decreased to 40.8% in 2017 compared to 41.7% in 2016. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to lower revenues from our M&I customers, which have a higher fixed cost structure, and approximately $18.0 million of non-cash fixed assets depreciation increases and write-offs. Domestically, pricing pressure on our SQ regulated waste and compliance customers negatively impacted our gross profit as a percentage of revenues. 

International gross profit is lower than domestic gross profit because our international operations have fewer small account customers, which tend to generate higher gross profit. Historically, our international operations generate most of their revenues from large account customers, such as hospitals, publically funded healthcare organizations and government bodies. As our international revenues increase, consolidated gross profit percentages experience downward pressure due to this "business mix" shift, which may be offset by additional international small account market penetration, integration savings, and domestic business expansions.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

SG&A expenses decreased $226.7 million, or 16.1%, in 2018 to $1.18 billion from $1.41 billion in 2017. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 33.8% in 2018 compared to 39.2% in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower charges associated with key strategies and significant matters, which were $395.7 million in 2018 compared to $622.4 million in 2017. These matters are discussed above. Additionally, there were also decreases in consulting and professional fees and bad debt expense partially offset by an increase in incentive based compensation as achievement was at higher overall levels during 2018. 

SG&A expenses increased $352.0 million, or 33.4%, in 2017 to $1.41 billion from $1.05 billion in 2016. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A increased to 39.2% of revenues in 2017 compared to 29.6% in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the impact of the SQ settlement and charges associated with key strategies and significant matters discussed above, which, in aggregate, contributed $337.6 million of the increase. In addition, there were increases in consulting and professional fees, partially offset by lower compensation and bad debt expense. 

Goodwill Impairment: 

Goodwill impairment was $358.7 million in 2018, compared with $65.0 million in 2017. 

In our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we disclosed that we were in the process of completing the October 1 annual goodwill impairment assessment and that certain of our reporting units, including Domestic CRS and Latin America, were potentially at risk for impairment based on our preliminary review of our long range plan (“LRP”) which was in the process of being finalized. We were also evaluating recent declines in our stock price and the impact on our reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.  

We performed our annual goodwill assessment as of October 1, 2018, and we continued to update our assumptions to reflect certain business and strategic developments during the fourth quarter, which negatively impacted the estimated cash flows of certain of our reporting units and resulted in our decision to also complete an interim assessment as of December 31, 2018. The Company determined that the Domestic CRS and Latin America reporting units’ carrying values were in excess of their estimated fair values.  

Factors that contributed to the estimated fair value of the reporting units being below their carrying value include: 

•  

For Domestic CRS we experienced a progressive decrease in revenues and operating margins in 2018 due to (i) continued declines in large recall events leading to a higher level of the uncertainty of these occurring in future periods. (ii) recall events that have a smaller number of

units and significantly lower revenue per event than we had experienced in recent years, and (iii) continued decline in inbound/outbound call volumes for our live voice services. We also gathered insights from our process of evaluating strategic alternatives that we initiated in 2018;  

•  

For Latin America we continue to experience prolonged challenges and volatility in certain of our markets due to declining market trends and cost pressures. Revenue increases in our Manufacturing and Industrial (“M&I”) business due to inflationary price increases in Argentina have been offset by the impact of currency devaluation and the continuing declines in several local economies.  

These challenges were factored into updates to our forecasted cash-flow assumptions during the fourth quarter to reflect our current outlook and we made certain adjustments to the discount rates used to present value these forecasted cash-flows. As a result of these impairment assessments, we recognized $286.3 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges to fully impair the goodwill of our Domestic CRS reporting unit. In addition, we recognized $72.4 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to our Latin America reporting unit. Following the impairment, the remaining Latin America reporting unit’s goodwill is $20 million. 

During 2017, as a result of our annual impairment assessment of goodwill we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge for our Latin America reporting unit of $65 million. 

Segment Profitability: We use Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of profitability for each of our Reportable Segments – see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 17 – Segment Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of this measure. Segment profitability and a reconciliation of the total for segment profitability to (loss) income from operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively was as follows:

2018 compared to 2017 

Adjusted EBITDA for our Domestic and Canada RCS reportable segment decreased $27.1 million, or 3.3%, in 2018 to $782.4 million from $809.5 million in 2017. As a percentage of Domestic and Canada RCS revenues, Adjusted EBITDA was 30.4% and 31.7%, for 2018 and 2017, respectively. This decrease was primarily a result of the impact of lower margins caused by the expected impact of pricing on our SQ medical waste customers as well as the pricing pressures we have experienced from our SQ regulated waste and compliance customers resulting from hospital consolidation of physician practices and increased competitive activities, partially offset by the impact of Business Transformation cost savings and efficiencies. Additionally, the overall decrease was partially offset by the benefits of increased volume and pricing on recycled paper. 

Adjusted EBITDA for our International RCS reportable segment increased $1.9 million, or 2.0%, in 2018 to $95.6 million from $93.7 million in 2017. As a percentage of International RCS revenues, Adjusted EBITDA was 14.6% and 13.2% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. We experienced improvements in overall margins in Europe as a result of our exit from some lower margin businesses. These improvements were partially offset by lower margins in Latin America due to a prolonged declining market trend and costs pressures.

Adjusted EBITDA for All Other decreased $42.2 million in 2018 to $(133.4) million from $(91.2) million in 2017. The decrease is a result of the lower revenues in our Domestic Communication and Related Services business combined with disproportionally lower gross profits due to the higher fixed costs nature for this business. 

2017 compared to 2016 

Adjusted EBITDA for our Domestic and Canada RCS reportable segment decreased $15.4 million, or 1.9%, in 2017 to $809.5 million from $824.9 million in 2016. As a percentage of Domestic and Canada RCS revenues, Adjusted EBITDA was 31.7% and 32.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease was a result of lower gross profit percentage as a result of the impacts associated with M&I customers, which have a higher fixed costs structure, and SQ regulated waste and compliance pricing pressures as well as higher costs related to wages and fuel. 

Adjusted EBITDA for our International RCS reportable segment increased $0.6 million, or 0.6%, in 2017 to $93.7 million from $93.1 million in 2016. As a percentage of International RCS revenues, Adjusted EBITDA was 13.2% and 12.4% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was a result of the impacts on gross margin and SG&A resulting from the divestiture of the lower margin patient transport business in the U.K. 

Adjusted EBITDA for All Other decreased $24.0 million, or 35.7%, in 2017 to $(91.2) million from $(67.2) million in 2016. 

Interest Expense, Net: Interest expense, net increased in 2018 to $106.0 million from $93.7 million in 2017 due to an increase in the overall interest rates on our borrowings caused by an increase in the LIBOR rate and interest rate adjustments related to both our private placement notes and senior credit facility combined with an overall increase in our average outstanding debt balance primarily due to funding the SQ settlement payment of $295.0 million using amounts available on our senior credit facility. 

In connection with the underlying terms, we saw an increase of 0.25% in the interest rate charged on our senior credit facility and term loan and total increases of 0.75% on the interest rates charged on our private placement notes. We expect that the annual impact of these late 2018 interest rate increases on our Interest expense, net will be approximately $11.8 million. 

Interest expense, net decreased in 2017 to $93.7 million from $97.8 million in 2016 due to a reduction of our average outstanding debt balance, partially offset by an increase in interest rates in the U.S. 

Other Expense, Net: Other expense, net increased in 2018 to $8.3 million from $6.6 million in 2017, primarily due to a $3.8 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the re-measurement of our Argentinian Peso denominated net monetary assets as a result of the designation, as of July 1, 2018, of Argentina as a highly inflationary economy. 

Other expense, net decreased in 2017 to $6.6 million from $7.9 million in 2016. 

Income Tax Benefit (Expense): Income tax benefit was $29.8 million in 2018 compared to $150.9 million in 2017. The effective tax rates for the years 2018 and 2017 were 10.8% and 139.9%, respectively. During 2017, as a result of the introduction of the Tax Act, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $129.8 million arising from the revaluing our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the newly enacted U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%, partially offset by a one-time transition tax on our

unremitted foreign earnings and profits which we have elected to pay over an eight-year period, and expected foreign withholding taxes. During 2018, in accordance with SAB 118, we recognized a charge of $8.8 million as we completed our analysis associated with the impact of the Tax Act. In addition, in 2018 and 2017 our effective rate was also impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairments in certain jurisdictions, and valuation allowances recognized against net operating losses in several countries. 

Income tax benefit was $150.9 million in 2017 compared to income tax expense of $120.2 million in 2016. The effective tax rates for the years 2017 and 2016 were 139.9% and 36.6%, respectively. The change in 2017 rate, when compared to 2016, was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act discussed above, partially offset by the impact of the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge recognized during the year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Details of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations can be found in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 8 – Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth for at least the next twelve months. Operating cash flows and the Company’s $1.2 billion senior credit facility are the Company’s primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company’s debt obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures necessary to support growth and productivity improvements, including those associated with our multiyear Business Transformation. 

Working Capital: At December 31, 2018, our working capital increased $170.1 million to $14.1 million compared to a deficit of $156.0 million at December 31, 2017. 

Current assets decreased $66.1 million in 2018 to $747.3 million from $813.4 million in 2017, primarily driven by a $24.5 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $26.5 million decrease in prepaid expenses and $20.8 million decrease in assets held for sale. Days sales outstanding (“DSO”) was 63 days at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 

Current liabilities decreased $236.2 million in 2018 to $733.2 million from $969.4 million in 2017, primarily due to the payment of $295.0 million related to the SQ settlement, which was funded from available capacity under our senior credit facility, partially offset by a $28.0 million increase in accrued compensation, primarily as a result of higher incentive compensation accruals in 2018 and the timing of payroll processing with respect to the year end and a $30.6 million increase in accounts payable in connection with our efforts to extend vendor terms under our Business Transformation initiatives and a temporary impact from the implementation of a purchase order system during the latter part of 2018. 

Operating Cash Flows: Net cash from operating activities decreased $342.9 million, or 67.4%, in 2018 to $165.7 million from $508.6 million in 2017. The primary drivers of this decline were the payment of the $295.0 million SQ settlement and payments related to legal and regulatory compliance and our Business Transformation initiatives. These amounts were partially offset by lower tax payments as a result of losses generated in the year and extending vendor payment terms and a temporary impact from the implementation of a purchase order system during the latter part of 2018. 

Investing Cash Flows: Net cash used in investing activities decreased $45.5 million, or 23.6%, in 2018 to $147.5 million from $193.0 million in 2017. We used $7.8 million less cash for acquisitions in 2018 than in

2017 and generated an additional $24.0 million from the divestiture of businesses during 2018. Our capital expenditures decreased by $12.2 million in 2018 and were at 3.8% and 4.0% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a percentage of revenues. Higher capital expenditures are expected in 2019, principally associated with our Business Transformation initiatives. 

Financing cash Flows: Net cash used in financing activities decreased $295.5 million, or 92.0%, in 2018 to $25.7 million from $321.2 million in 2017. We funded the $295.0 million SQ settlement from available capacity under our senior credit facility resulting in net borrowings of $68.7 million during 2018 compared to net repayments of $175.6 million on our senior credit facility, private placement, and term loan facility during 2017. We had net repayments on our other debt, including foreign debt, capital leases, and other long-term debt of $78.4 million during 2018 compared to $84.3 million during 2017. We had preferred share repurchases of $17.2 million in 2018 compared to $34.2 million in 2017. Dividends of $25.5 million and $36.3 million were paid during 2018 and 2017, respectively, to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. In accordance with the terms of issue the Series A Preferred Stock was converted to common stock in September 2018 – see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 14 – Preferred Stock in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and cash commitments at December 31, 2018:

Payments for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from contractual obligations. Based on the uncertain nature of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make an estimate of the period of potential settlement, if any, with the applicable taxing authorities. 

We had elected to pay our $23.5 million transition tax liability over eight years. We are in a net receivable position with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). As the amounts become due they will be offset with the amounts on deposit with the IRS.

Environmental liabilities are not presented above but are accrued on an undiscounted basis and are associated with identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated but the timing of such payments is not fixed and determinable (see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

As of December 31, 2018, we had $63.1 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding against our senior credit facility and a further $52.2 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding against another facility, $63.7 million of surety bonds, and $19.5 million of bank guarantees. The bank guarantees are issued mostly by our international subsidiaries for various purposes, including leases, seller notes, contracts and permits. The surety bonds are used for performance guarantees. Neither the bank guarantees nor the surety bonds affect our ability to use our various lines of credit. 

We anticipate that our operating cash flows, together with additional borrowings available under our senior unsecured credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses, strategic initiatives such as Business Transformation, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s most critical accounting policies are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and those policies that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of the Company. Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Polices in the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a detailed description of all of our material accounting policies, however the Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Revenue Recognition: The Company’s revenue recognition policy is detailed in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Polices in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company reports accounts receivable at their net realizable value, which is management’s best estimate of the cash that will ultimately be received. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectability of accounts receivable based on historical collection data and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. The adequacy of allowances for uncollectible accounts is reviewed at least quarterly, and adjusted as necessary based on such reviews. A considerable amount of management’s judgment is required to assess the collectability of an account, based on detailed analysis of the aging of the receivables, the creditworthiness of our customers, historical collection trends and current economic trends. Accounts receivable written off in subsequent periods can differ from the allowance for doubtful accounts provided, but historically our

PART II 

provision has been adequate. Allowance for doubtful accounts was $71.9 million and $65.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Intangible Asset Valuations: The methods commonly used to value intangible assets we acquire are the income, market and cost approaches. The nature and characteristics of the asset indicate which approach is most appropriate. Based on the analysis performed by the Company, the fair values of intangible assets are generally estimated using acceptable income approaches. 

A multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”) is generally used to determine the fair value of customer relationships. The fair value is derived by calculating the present value of the estimated after-tax earnings attributable to the respective intangible assets. Key inputs and assumptions to the valuation model are forecasted after-tax cash-flows, the identification of contributory assets and the quantification of appropriate returns on these assets, the discount rate applied to present value the cash-flows and attrition rates. Determining an accurate consumption of benefits from acquired customer relationships cannot be reliably determined because the services we provide to acquired customers change from the base-line revenues over an extended period of time due to factors such as volume increase, price increase, and complementary service offerings. Therefore, we amortize our finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method consistent with our valuation model. 

A relief from royalty method is generally used to determine the fair value of tradenames. Key inputs and assumptions to the valuation model are a reasonable approximation of the license rate for the trade name, forecasted revenues and the discount rate applied to present value the after-tax stream of estimated royalties avoided by acquiring the trade name. 

Tangible Asset Valuation: Trucks, containers and equipment are some of the major asset classes subject to revaluation as a result of our acquisitions. The indirect and direct methods of the cost approach and the market approach are used by the Company to value tangible personal property assets. Following is a description of the methodologies for estimating the fair value of the major tangible fixed asset classes: 

•  

The market approach is used for the valuation of trucks. The market approach is based on market conditions and transactions. In the market approach, the assets being valued are compared to recent sales and/or asking prices of comparable properties or assets. In using similar units of comparison, adjustments are made to the comparable assets to account for factors such as condition, capacity, and age. 

•  

The direct method of the cost approach is used in the valuation of containers. In the direct method of the cost approach, replacement cost new (“RCN”) is determined through current cost information obtained from original equipment manufacturers, equipment dealers and vendors, and independent research. 

•  

The cost of reproduction new (“CRN”) for equipment is calculated using the indirect method of the cost approach. Historical equipment costs and dates are used to calculate the current CRN. In the indirect method of the cost approach, trend factors are applied to the historical costs to estimate the CRN of the assets. Time-adjusted trend factors are applied to historical costs using asset category specific cost indices published by industry sources. The CRN is then adjusted for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. 

Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable tangibles of a business acquired. Goodwill is not subject to  

2018 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 60   

PART II 

amortization but is subject to evaluation for impairment annually as of October 1 or when an indicator of impairment exists. 

We used a quantitative approach to assess goodwill for impairment. The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the income approach (including discounted cash flows (“DCF”)) and validated using a market approach with the involvement of a third party valuation specialist. The Company's reporting units are: Domestic Healthcare Compliance Services, Domestic Shred-it, Domestic CRS, Domestic Environmental Solutions, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The income approach uses expected future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts those cash flows to present value. Expected future cash flows are calculated using management assumptions of growth rates, including long-term growth rates, capital expenditures, and cost efficiencies. Future acquisitions are not included in the expected future cash flows. We use a discount rate based on a calculated weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on size, country and company specific risk premiums. The market approach compares the valuation multiples of similar companies to that of the associated reporting unit. We then reconcile the calculated fair values to our market capitalization. The fair value is then compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value is in excess of its carrying value, the related goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge in the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. 

The goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments, and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity in determination of the fair value of the reporting units. Estimating a reporting unit's projected cash flows involves the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors, including long-term growth rates, operating margin, including, selling, general and administrative expense rates, working capital, capital expenditures, allocation of shared or corporate items, among other factors. These estimates are based on internal current operating plans and long-term forecasts for each reporting unit. These projected cash flow estimates are then discounted, which necessitates the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The discount rates selected reflect market-based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit and also include a company specific risk premium. The market value comparisons of fair value require the selection of appropriate peer group companies. In addition, we analyze differences between the sum of the fair value of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums. 

We performed our annual goodwill assessment as of October 1, 2018, and we continued to update our assumptions to reflect certain business and strategic developments during the fourth quarter, which negatively impacted the estimated cash flows of certain of our reporting units and resulted in our decision to also complete an interim assessment as of December 31, 2018. 

The outcome of the goodwill impairment assessments are discussed further above in the Goodwill Impairment section of Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Goodwill Impairment. (For additional information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

A measure of sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit's fair value exceeds their respective carrying value. Subsequent to the impairment charges incurred through December 31, 2018, the amount of fair value in excess of carrying value based on reporting unit specific risk premiums considered during the fourth quarter impairment

PART II 

assessments is as follows: for the Domestic reporting units by no less than ten percent and as much as approximately ninety percent, for the International reporting units, other than Latin America, by no less than twenty five percent and as much as approximately sixty percent.  For the Latin America reporting unit, a future reduction in fair value may result in additional impairment charges after consideration of changes in carrying value at the time of the impairment assessment. We performed sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values as of December 31 2018, noting that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 50 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate would not result in impairments, except for an incremental impairment charge for our Latin America reporting unit of approximately $7 million or $4 million, respectively. Following the impairment charges incurred through December 31, 2018, the Domestic CRS and Latin America reporting units have recorded goodwill, remaining of zero and $20 million, net of accumulated impairment, respectively.  

The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process may significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit. Generally, changes in DCF estimates would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. We believe that the estimated fair value used in measuring the impairment was based on reasonable assumptions but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent judgment in making such estimates. 

Other Identifiable Intangible Assets: Indefinite life intangibles are also not subject to amortization but are assessed for impairment in the same manner as goodwill. Indefinite lived intangibles may be assessed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. The qualitative approach first determines if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value. If no such determination is made, then the impairment test is complete. If, however, it is determined that there is a likely impairment, a quantitative assessment must then be made. One factor in our determination of whether to use the qualitative approach is the time elapsed since the last assessment using the quantitative approach. 

We have determined that our operating permits and certain tradenames have indefinite lives due to our ability to renew them with minimal additional cost, and therefore they are not amortized. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company performed its annual impairment test on indefinite lived intangibles, other than goodwill, using the qualitative approach for certain assets and the quantitative approach for the remaining assets. The calculated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, internal and external processing costs, and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. 

Future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of the assumptions described above may negatively impact future valuations. In future measurements of fair value, adverse changes in assumptions could result in impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets that would require non-cash charges and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results. 

Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives using the straight-line method. Our customer relationships have useful lives from 5 to 25 years based upon the type of customer. We have non-compete covenant intangibles with useful lives from 5 to 14 years. We also have tradename intangibles with useful lives from 4 to 40 years. 

We evaluate the useful life of our intangible assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful life and changes are reflected prospectively as the intangible asset is amortized over the revised remaining useful life. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the  

2018 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 62   

PART II 

Company performed its annual assessment of the useful life of its finite-lived intangibles. The Company updated the useful life of its customer relationship intangibles as a result of analyzing recent quantitative and qualitative observations in the market and factors impacting our business. The change in estimate will be accounted for prospectively. The weighted average remaining life was adjusted from approximately 10.9 to 9.2 years to reflect the new estimated useful lives. We estimate that there will be an approximately 5-10% increase to annual amortization expense. 

Environmental Remediation Liabilities: Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating air, groundwater, surface water, soil contamination, and applicable legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, and the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) and the financial viability of those PRP’s. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we contracted with or owned the site. Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remediation are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. (For additional information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Income Taxes:  We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. 

Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance of $35.3 million was related to foreign net operating losses and tax deductible goodwill that we are not expected to realize. 

We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained

on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2018, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $64.7 million, of which $61.8 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. 

In accordance with SAB 118, the Company calculated, with the involvement of a third party tax specialist its provisional tax impact of the Tax Act on its year end 2017 income tax provision and as a result recognized an income tax (benefit) of ($129.8) million in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. During the allowed measurement period, the Company completed its analysis and recognized adjustments, resulting in a charge of $8.8 million, to the 2017 provisional amount during 2018. 

The Tax Act also establishes global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions that impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on intangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company could elect that its accounting policy will be to recognize deferred taxes for basis differences that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal or to recognize taxes on GILTI as an expense in the period incurred and chose to report on the basis that the taxes on GILTI will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense.

Insured and Self-Insured Claims: We have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our employee benefit, auto/fleet, general liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. The exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, are based on third party actuarial valuations and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss developments significantly differ from our assumptions used. Estimated recoveries associated with our insured claims are recognized as assets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable. 

Stock Based Compensation: We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award or on the fair value of the liabilities incurred. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) for date vesting awards. Performance based awards are recognized consistent with performance metrics and Accounting Standards Codification Section 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation. No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. 

The grant-date fair value of incentive stock options (“ISOs”) and similar instruments are estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available). Option-pricing models (Black Scholes) include assumptions that are evaluated by a third party valuation specialist and evaluated and approved by the Vice President and Treasurer based on historical experience, current company trends and comparative analysis to industry trends. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental

compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. 

Restricted shares (“RSUs”) awarded to an employee and Performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) awarded are measured at its fair value, once the related performance criteria have been established, which is the same amount for which a similarly restricted share would be issued to third parties. A non-vested equity share unit awarded to an employee is measured at its fair value as if it were vested and issued on the grant date. 

Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
