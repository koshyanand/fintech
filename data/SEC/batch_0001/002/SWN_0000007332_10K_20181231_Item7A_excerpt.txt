ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

 ﻿  

 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as service costs and credit risk concentrations. We use fixed price swap agreements, options, basis swaps and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, oil and certain NGLs along with interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures that utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is also overseen by our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings.

 Credit Risk  

 ﻿  

 Our exposure to concentrations of credit risk consists primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our purchasers and their dispersion across geographic areas. However, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, two subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell Plc in aggregate accounted for approximately 10.4% and 10.3%, respectively, of total natural gas, oil and NGL sales. A default on this account could have a material impact on the Company, but we do not believe that there is a material risk of an event of default. During the year ended December 31, 2016, no single third-party purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas, oil and NGL production. See “Commodities Risk” below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading.

Interest Rate Risk  

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 6.68%, and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently have an interest rate swap in effect to mitigate a portion of our exposure to volatility in interest rates. At December 31, 2018, we had a long-term issuer credit rating of Ba2 by Moody’s, a long-term debt rating of BB by S&P and a long-term debt issuer default rating of BB by Fitch Ratings. Any upgrades or downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody’s or S&P could decrease or increase our cost of funds, respectively.

 Commodities Risk  

 ﻿  

 We use over-the-counter fixed price swap agreements and options to protect sales of our production against the inherent risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps) and transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps).  

 ﻿  

 The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for our production. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the production that is financially protected. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major banks and integrated energy companies that management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non-performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. We refer you to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our derivative instruments.
