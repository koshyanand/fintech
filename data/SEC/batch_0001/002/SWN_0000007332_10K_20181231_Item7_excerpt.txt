 OVERVIEW  

 ﻿  

 Background  

 ﻿  

 Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” or “Southwestern”) is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas, oil and NGL exploration, development and production, which we refer to as “E&P.” We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we refer to as “Midstream.” We conduct most of our businesses through subsidiaries, and we currently operate exclusively in the United States.   

 ﻿  

 E&P. Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs, with our ongoing operations focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania, which we refer to as “Northeast Appalachia,” are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale. Our operations in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania, which we refer to as “Southwest Appalachia,” are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs. Collectively, our properties in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are herein referred to as the “Appalachian Basin.” We also have drilling rigs located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and we provide certain oilfield products and services, principally serving our E&P operations though vertical integration.  

 ﻿  

 On August 30, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell 100% of the equity in certain of our subsidiaries that conducted our operations in Arkansas, which were primarily focused on an unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Fayetteville Shale, for $1,865 million, subject to customary adjustments. In early December 2018, we completed the Fayetteville Shale sale, resulting in net proceeds of $1,650 million, following adjustments due primarily to the net cash flows from the economic effective date of July 1, 2018, to the closing date.  

 Midstream. Our marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil, and NGLs produced in our E&P operations. In December 2018, we divested almost all of our gathering assets as part of the Fayetteville Shale sale.  

 ﻿  

 Changes in 2018. At the beginning of 2018, we announced our strategy to reposition the Company through portfolio optimization, balance sheet management and leveraging our technical, commercial and operational expertise to improve margins. We sharpened our focus on developing our high-value, liquids-rich Appalachian basin assets. We strengthened our balance sheet through asset monetization and debt reduction by entering into a new reserve-based credit facility and paying down outstanding debt, which improved our debt maturity profile while preserving financial and operational flexibility. We sold our Fayetteville Shale assets, further reducing our debt, repurchasing shares and earmarking proceeds for our 2019 and 2020 capital investment programs and other general corporate purposes. We made further technological advances in drilling precision and completion optimization that enhanced well productivity and economics, resulting in improved returns, and we focused on identifying and implementing opportunities to lower our overall cost structure. We added to our derivative portfolio, protecting approximately 479 Bcfe and 117 Bcfe of our forecasted 2019 and 2020 production, respectively, from price volatility through the use of commodity derivatives.

Recent Financial and Operating Results  

 ﻿  

 Significant operating and financial highlights for 2018 include:   

 ﻿  

 Total Company  

   ·    Net income attributable to common stock of $535 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, down from a net income attributable to common stock of $816 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a loss on unsettled derivatives of $24 million in 2018 as compared to a gain of $451 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of unsettled derivatives, net income attributable to common stock was up $194 million, or 53%, compared to 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Total debt of approximately $2.3 billion decreased by $2.1 billion, or 47%, compared to 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 E&P  

   ·    E&P segment operating income of $794 million was up 45%, compared to $549 million in 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Total net production of 946 Bcfe, including 702 Bcfe from our Appalachian Basin and 243 Bcf from the Fayetteville Shale, increased 5% from 2017, and was comprised of 85% natural gas and 15% oil and NGLs. 

   ·    Excluding the effect of derivatives, our realized natural gas price of $2.45 per Mcf, realized oil price of $56.79 per barrel and realized NGL price of $17.91 per barrel increased 10%, 32% and 24%, respectively, from 2017. 

   ·    The E&P segment invested $1,231 million in capital drilling 106 wells, completing 119 wells and placing 138 wells to sales. 

 ﻿  

 Outlook  

 ﻿  

 We expect to continue to exercise capital discipline through a fully-funded 2019 capital investment program. We remain committed to our focus on optimizing our portfolio by concentrating our efforts on our highest return assets, looking for opportunities to maximize margins in each core area of our business and further developing our knowledge of our asset base. We believe our industry will continue to face challenges due to the uncertainty of natural gas, oil and NGL prices in the United States, changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment, and other key factors described above under “Risk Factors.”  

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 ﻿  

 The following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations. We evaluate our segments as if they were stand-alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations. Restructuring charges, interest expense, gain (loss) on derivatives, loss on early extinguishment of debt and income tax expense are discussed on a consolidated basis.

E&P  

 ﻿  

 The table below includes the effects of the sale of the E&P assets included in the Fayetteville Shale sale which closed on December 3, 2018.   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes $37 million of restructuring charges, an $18 million loss on the sale of assets and $15 million of non-full cost pool asset impairments. 

 ﻿  

   (2)    Includes $81 million of restructuring and other one-time charges for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

 ﻿  

   (3)    Represents the gain (loss) on settled commodity derivatives and includes $1 million and $5 million amortization of premiums paid related to certain natural gas call options for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

 ﻿  

 Operating Income  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    E&P segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an impairment of natural gas and oil properties of $2.3 billion. Excluding the 2016 impairment, our E&P segment operating income increased $627 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, due to a $673 million increase in revenues, partially offset by a $46 million increase in operating costs. 

 ﻿  

 Revenues  

 ﻿  

 The following illustrate the effects on sales revenues associated with changes in commodity prices and production volumes:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 In addition to the sales revenues detailed above, our E&P segment had $5 million and $4 million of other operating revenues, primarily related to water sales to third-party operators for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Production Volumes  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    The Fayetteville Shale assets and associated reserves were sold on December 3, 2018.  

 ﻿  

   (2)    Approximately 240 Bcfe, 179 Bcfe and 148 Bcfe for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were produced from the Marcellus Shale formation. 

 ﻿  

   ·    Production volumes for our E&P segment increased by 49 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, as increased production volumes from Northeast and Southwest Appalachia more than offset decreased natural gas production volumes in the Fayetteville Shale, which reflects only eleven months of production in 2018 as a result of its sale in December 2018. 

   ·    E&P segment production volumes increased 22 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, as increased natural gas production volumes in Northeast and Southwest Appalachia more than offset decreased production volumes in the Fayetteville Shale. 

 ﻿  

 Commodity Prices  

 ﻿  

 The price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in determining the capital investments we make to develop our properties. Commodity prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict, including increased supplies of natural gas, oil or NGLs due to greater exploration and development activities, weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy sources. These factors impact supply and demand, which in turn determine the sales prices for our production. In addition to these factors, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices, including basis differentials. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environments and adjust the pace of our activities in order to not exceed our fully-funded 2019 capital investment program.

   (1)    Based on last day settlement prices from monthly futures contracts. 

   (2)    This discount includes a basis differential, a heating content adjustment, physical basis sales, third-party transportation charges and fuel charges, and excludes financial basis hedges. 

 ﻿  

 We receive a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to average monthly NYMEX settlement prices based on heating content of the gas, locational basis differentials and transportation and fuel charges. Additionally, we receive a sales price for our oil and NGLs at a difference to average monthly West Texas Intermediate settlement and Mont Belvieu NGL composite prices, respectively, due to a number of factors including product quality, composition and types of NGLs sold, locational basis differentials and transportation and fuel charges.  

 ﻿  

 We regularly enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas, oil and NGL production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials. We refer you to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Annual Report, Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, and our derivative risk factor for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities.

 Lease Operating Expenses  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Lease operating expenses per Mcfe increased $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to increased transportation and processing costs, as our production growth shifted toward the Appalachian Basin. 

 ﻿  

 54  

 Table of Contents  

 Index to Financial Statements   

General and Administrative Expenses  

   ·    General and administrative expenses decreased in 2018, compared to 2017, as a $20 million decrease in costs resulting from the mid-year implementation of cost reductions and decreased personnel costs was partially offset by a $4 million increase in legal settlement charges. 

   ·    On a per Mcfe basis, excluding restructuring and legal settlement charges, general and administrative expenses per Mcfe decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, due to a 10% decrease in expenses and a 5% increase in production volumes. 

   ·    On a per Mcfe basis, excluding restructuring and legal settlement charges, general and administrative expenses per Mcfe remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, as a slight increase in expenses was offset by a 3% increase in production volumes. 

 ﻿  

 Taxes, Other than Income Taxes  

   ·    Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe may vary from period to period due to changes in ad valorem and severance taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Excluding $1 million of restructuring charges in 2018, taxes, other than income taxes, per Mcfe decreased $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an $8 million severance tax refund related to a favorable assessment on deductible expenses in Southwest Appalachia, a $1 million severance tax refund related to a favorable assessment on deductible expenses in the Fayetteville Shale, favorable property tax assessments, and property and sales tax refunds recorded in the first quarter of 2018. 

   ·    On a per Mcfe basis, taxes, other than income taxes, remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as a slight increase in expense was more than offset by an increase in production volumes.  

 ﻿  

 Full Cost Pool Amortization  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs that result from full cost ceiling impairments, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool, and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserve changes. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 See “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization.  

 ﻿  

 Impairments  

 ﻿  

 In accordance with accounting guidance for Property, Plant and Equipment, assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Because the assets outside the full cost pool met the criteria for held for sale accounting in the third quarter of 2018, we determined the carrying value of certain non-full cost pool E&P assets exceeded the fair value less costs to sell. As a result, an impairment charge of $15 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Midstream  

 ﻿  

 The table below reflects the sale of gas gathering assets included in the Fayetteville Shale sale which closed on December 3, 2018, resulting in a net gain and approximately eleven months of gathering activity for the year ended December 31, 2018.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Includes $2 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

 ﻿  

   (2)    Includes $3 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

 ﻿  

 Operating Income  

   ·    Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $155 million of impairments and $2 million of restructuring charges. The impairments were comprised of $145 million related to our gathering assets included in the Fayetteville Shale sale, and $10 million related to other non-core gathering assets. Excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, operating income from our Midstream segment decreased $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to an $83 million decrease in gas gathering revenues and a $1 million decrease in marketing margin, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in operating costs and expenses and a $29 million increase in gain on sale of assets, net. 

   ·    Operating income decreased $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to a $47 million decrease in gas gathering revenues and a $3 million decrease in marketing margin, partially offset by an $18 million decrease in operating costs and expenses and a $6 million gain on the sale of certain compressor equipment. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Margins are driven primarily by volumes marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. Increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices and volumes marketed are largely offset by corresponding changes in marketing purchase expenses. We enter into derivative contracts from time to time with respect to our marketing activities to provide margin protection. For more information about our derivatives and risk management activities, we refer you to Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.  

 ﻿  

 Revenues  

   ·    Revenues from our marketing activities increased $630 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to a 12% increase in the price received for volumes marketed and a 96 Bcfe increase in the volumes marketed.  

   ·    For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our marketing activities increased $676 million, compared to 2016, primarily due to a 30% increase in the price received for volumes marketed and a 5 Bcfe increase in the volumes marketed.

 Operating Costs and Expenses  

   ·    Operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $2 million of restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, operating costs and expenses decreased $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an $18 million decrease in depreciation, an $8 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, a $6 million decrease in gathering operating expenses and a $1 million decrease in taxes other than income taxes. In addition, the sale of our gathering assets in early December 2018 resulted in only approximately eleven months of gathering operations for 2018. 

   ·    Operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $3 million of restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, operating costs and expenses decreased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to reduced compression and personnel costs due to lower activity levels as a result of decreasing volumes gathered in the Fayetteville Shale. 

 ﻿  

 Impairments  

 ﻿  

 In the second quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $10 million related to certain non-core gathering assets. In the third quarter of 2018, the Fayetteville Shale gathering assets were classified as held for sale. As such, we determined the carrying value of our gathering assets held for sale exceeded the fair value less the costs to sell. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $145 million in 2018.  

 ﻿  

 Consolidated  

 ﻿  

 Restructuring Charges  

 ﻿  

 On June 27, 2018, we announced a workforce reduction plan, which resulted primarily from our previously announced study of structural, process and organizational changes to enhance shareholder value and continues with respect to other aspects of our business and activities. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of a portion of equity awards that were cancelled. We recognized $23 million in restructuring charges related to the workforce reduction plan for the year ended December 31, 2018.  

 ﻿  

 In December 2018, we closed the sale of the equity in certain of our subsidiaries that owned and operated our Fayetteville Shale E&P and related midstream gathering assets in Arkansas. As part of this transaction, most employees associated with those assets became employees of the buyer although the employment of some was or will be terminated. All affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of a portion of equity awards that were forfeited. We incurred $12 million in severance costs related to the Fayetteville Shale sale for the year ended December 31, 2018 and have recognized these costs as restructuring charges.  

 ﻿  

 As a result of the Fayetteville Shale sale, we incurred $4 million in charges primarily related to office consolidation and have recognized these costs as restructuring charges.   

 ﻿  

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized total restructuring charges of $39 million, of which $33 million was related to cash severance, including payroll taxes withheld and professional fees. The plans had been substantially implemented as of the end of the year, however, certain employment terminations were delayed into 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded a liability of $5 million related to severance to be paid out in 2019.   

 ﻿  

 In January 2016, we announced a workforce reduction, which was substantially concluded by the end of March 2016. In April 2016, we also partially restructured executive management. Affected employees were offered a severance package that included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, accelerated vesting of outstanding stock-based equity awards. As a result of the workforce reduction and executive management restructuring, we recognized restructuring charges of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Interest Expense  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   ·    Interest expense related to our senior notes increased for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to the higher average interest rates associated with our senior notes due 2026 and 2027, which were issued in September 2017. 

   ·    Interest expense related to our senior notes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, as a decrease in interest expense related to the gradual redemption of our 7.50% Senior Notes due in February 2018, which began in July 2016 and completed in May 2017, was only partially offset by increased interest expense which resulted from the issuance of new senior notes in September 2017. 

   ·    Interest expense related to our credit arrangements decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the extinguishment of our 2016 term loan and entering into our revolving credit facility in April 2018, which decreased our outstanding borrowing amount, and the repayment of our revolving credit facility borrowings with a portion of the net proceeds from the Fayetteville Shale sale. 

   ·    For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense related to our credit arrangements increased, as compared to the same period in 2016, due to increased outstanding borrowings and higher interest rates. 

   ·    Capitalized interest increased $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, and increased as a percentage of gross interest expense due to our increased cost of borrowing. The decreases in capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, were primarily due to the continued evaluation of a portion of our Southwest Appalachia assets.

 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Table of Contents  

 Index to Financial Statements   

   ·    Concurrent with the closing of our revolving credit facility on April 26, 2018, we repaid our $1,191 million 2016 secured term loan balance and recognized a loss on early debt extinguishment of $8 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to the unamortized debt issuance expense.  

   ·    In September 2017, we used the net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion from our September 2017 senior notes offering to repurchase approximately $758 million of our 2020 Senior Notes and to repay the remaining $327 million principal amount outstanding of our 2015 Term Loan. We recognized a loss of $59 million for the redemption of these senior notes which included $53 million of premiums paid. 

   ·    In the first half of 2017, we redeemed the remaining $276 million principal amount outstanding of our 2018 Senior Notes, recognizing a loss of $11 million. 

   ·    During the third quarter of 2016, we used proceeds from our $1,247 million July 2016 equity offering to purchase and retire $700 million of our outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018 and retire $375 million of our $750 million term loan entered into in November 2015. We recognized a loss of $51 million for the redemption of these senior notes, which included $50 million of premiums paid. 

 ﻿  

 Income Taxes  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   ·    The income tax expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased, as compared with 2017, primarily due to state income taxes resulting from the Fayetteville Shale sale partially offset by a benefit recorded related to an increased alternative minimum tax receivable, as well as changes to the overall valuation allowance activity during 2018. 

   ·    The income tax benefits recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from changes in federal tax legislation enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) which will allow us to recover certain alternative minimum tax credit carryovers, along with the expiration of a portion of our uncertain tax provision. 

   ·    Our low effective tax rate is the result of our recognition of a valuation allowance that reduced the deferred tax asset primarily related to our current net operating loss carryforward, as well as changes to the deferred tax rate enacted under the recent Tax Reform. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

 ﻿  

 We refer you to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion about our income taxes.  

 ﻿  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 ﻿  

 We depend on funds generated from our operations, our cash and cash equivalents balance, our revolving credit facility and capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. Although we have financial flexibility with our cash balance and the ability to draw on our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility (less outstanding letters of credit which were approximately $0.1 billion as of December 31, 2018), we continue to be committed to our capital discipline strategy of investing within our cash flow from operations net of changes in working capital, supplemented by a portion of the net proceeds from the Fayetteville Shale sale.

 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, in December 2018, we closed on the Fayetteville Shale sale and received net proceeds of approximately $1,650 million, which included preliminary purchase price adjustments of approximately $215 million primarily related to the net cash flows from the economic effective date to the closing date. From the net proceeds received, $914 million was used to repurchase $900 million of our outstanding senior notes along with related accrued interest and retirement premiums paid, as discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, and through December 31, 2018, $180 million has been used to repurchase approximately 39 million shares of our outstanding common stock. We may use a portion of the remaining net proceeds from the Fayetteville Shale sale to supplement cash flow related to the further development of our liquids-rich Appalachian assets in order to accelerate the path to self-funding and for general corporate purposes. Pending these other uses, a portion of these remaining net proceeds have been used to repay revolving credit facility borrowings until investments are made.

Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the sales prices that we receive for our natural gas and liquids production. Natural gas, oil and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand, which is impacted by many factors. The sales price we receive for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities. Our derivative contracts allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details.   

 ﻿  

 Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to settle the transaction. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities.  

 ﻿  

 Our short-term cash flows are also dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and joint interest owners. We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write-offs for non-collectable amounts. However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and joint interest partners could adversely impact our cash flows.   

 ﻿  

 Due to the above factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. Accordingly, we expect to adjust our discretionary uses of cash depending upon available cash flow. Further, we may from time to time seek to retire, rearrange or amend some or all of our outstanding debt or debt agreements through cash purchases, and/or exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

 Credit Arrangements and Financing Activities  

 ﻿  

 On April 26, 2018, as part of our strategic effort to increase financial flexibility and reduce costs, we replaced our credit facilities (which consisted of a $1,191 million secured term loan and two unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $809 million) with a new revolving credit facility. The 2018 revolving credit facility initially had a maximum borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion and commitments of $2.0 billion and is subject to semiannual borrowing base redeterminations by the lenders in April and October. Borrowings also may not exceed the permitted lien limitations in our senior note indentures. The borrowing base is subject to change based primarily on drilling results, commodity prices, the level of capital investing and operating costs. In October 2018, our borrowing base was reduced from an initial $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion and, upon the closing of the Fayetteville Shale sale in December 2018, was reduced to $2.1 billion with our commitments remaining at $2.0 billion. The permitted lien provisions in the senior note indentures currently limit liens securing indebtedness to the greater of $2.0 billion and 25% of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets. The 2018 revolving credit facility matures in April 2023, and as of December 31, 2018, had no borrowings outstanding. We also have $112 million in letters of credit outstanding but not drawn with banks in our credit facility.   

 ﻿  

 By entering into the 2018 revolving credit facility, we realized certain benefits including:   

   ·    Reduction in debt outstanding and simplification of our capital structure by consolidating the components of the 2016 credit facility into a senior secured revolving credit facility and by terminating our 2013 credit facility (consisting of an unsecured $66 million revolving credit facility).  

   ·    Reduced interest expense due to both the termination of the $1,191 million secured term loan and lower interest margins associated with the 2018 revolving credit facility. 

   ·    Greater access to liquidity by extending the maturity from December 2020 (under the 2016 credit facility) to April 2023 under the 2018 revolving credit facility.  

   ·    Increased financial flexibility by eliminating certain provisions in the 2016 credit facility associated with minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on asset sale proceeds. 

 ﻿  

 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into hedges that, when added to then-existing hedges including hedges put in place as part of the Fayetteville Shale sale that the buyer was obligated to assume at closing of that sale, exceeded a cap on hedges for the month of December 2018 under a covenant under our credit agreement. In conjunction with the closing, the buyer paid for the settlement of the December 2018 hedges it was to assume. The lenders have subsequently waived all matters associated with this default. Otherwise, as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the remaining covenants of our revolving credit facility in all material respects. Although we do not anticipate any future violations of the financial covenants, our ability to comply with these covenants is in part dependent upon the success of our exploration and

development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas and liquids. We refer you to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the covenant requirements of our revolving credit facility.  

 ﻿  

 The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our revolving credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility. Although we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet their obligation to us. We refer you to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our revolving credit facility.  

 ﻿  

 In December 2018, we closed on the Fayetteville Shale sale resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1,650 million, following customary preliminary purchase price adjustments of $215 million primarily related to the net cash flows from the economic effective date to the closing date and certain other working capital adjustments. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase $900 million of our outstanding senior notes.  

 ﻿  

 Because of the focused work on refinancing and repayment of our debt during 2017 and 2018, only $265 million, or 11%, of our outstanding debt balance as of December 31, 2018 will come due prior to 2025, with only $52 million of that coming due in the next three years. We expect to save approximately $80 million in annual debt interest from our 2018 debt reduction efforts.  

 ﻿  

 At February 26, 2019, we had a long-term issuer credit rating of Ba2 by Moody’s, a long-term debt rating of BB by S&P and a long-term issuer default rating of BB by Fitch Ratings. Any upgrades or downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody’s or S&P could decrease or increase our cost of funds, respectively.

Cash Flow from Investing Activities  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    For the year ended December 31, 2017, total E&P capital investing increased $625 million, compared to the same period in 2016, due to a $652 million increase in direct E&P capital investing which was only partially offset by a $27 million decrease in capitalized interest and internal costs. The significant increase in 2017 capital investing resulted from our decision to suspend drilling activity in the first half of 2016 due to an unfavorable commodity price environment. We began increasing activity in the second half of 2016. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    The decrease in capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to the continued evaluation of a portion of our Southwest Appalachia assets acquired in December 2014. 

   ·    Midstream capital investing decreased $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the shift in focus to our core E&P assets. 

   ·    For the year ended December 31, 2017, Midstream capital investing increased $11 million, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the purchase of several leased compressors in 2017 which were subsequently sold to third parties for a net gain of $6 million.

 Included in the transportation charges above are $114 million (potentially due in less than one year) and $107 million (potentially due in one to two years) related to certain agreements that remain in the name of our marketing affiliate but are expected to be paid in full by Flywheel Energy Operating, LLC, the purchaser of the Fayetteville Shale assets. Of these amounts, we may be obligated to reimburse Flywheel Energy for a portion of volumetric shortfalls during 2019 and 2020 (up to $102 million) under these transportation agreements and have currently recorded an $88 million liability as of December 31, 2018.  

 ﻿  

 Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we agreed to purchase firm transportation with pipelines in the Appalachian Basin starting in 2021 and running through 2032 totaling $357 million in total contractual commitments of which the seller has agreed to reimburse us for $133 million of this commitment.  

 ﻿  

   (2)    Interest payments on our senior notes were calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at December 31, 2018. Estimated interest payments on the revolving credit facility were excluded from this table since there was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2018 on our revolving credit facility. Senior note interest rates were based on our credit ratings as of December 31, 2018. 

 ﻿  

   (3)    Operating leases include costs for compressors, drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, aircraft, office space and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2028.  

 ﻿  

   (4)    As of December 31, 2018, our E&P segment had commitments of approximately $4.9 million for compression services associated primarily with our Southwest Appalachia division. 

 ﻿  

   (5)    Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $16 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements. 

 ﻿  

 Liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows related to such liabilities. Also excluded from the table above are future contributions to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. For further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below for additional information.  

 ﻿  

 We refer you to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the terms of our debt.   

 We are subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, employment matters, traffic incidents, pollution, contamination, encroachment on others’ property or nuisance. We accrue for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any additional loss, or range of loss that is reasonably possible, but based on the nature of the claims, management believes that current litigation, claims and   

 64  

 Table of Contents

proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it is possible that adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management’s view may change in the future.  

 ﻿  

 We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

 ﻿  

 The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

 ﻿  

 Natural Gas and Oil Properties  

 ﻿  

 We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized on a country-by-country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at 10% (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Companies using the full cost method are required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves.  

 ﻿  

 Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and related capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2018, we had a total of $1,755 million of costs excluded from our amortization base, all of which related to our properties in the United States. Inclusion of some or all of these costs in our properties in the United States in the future, without adding any associated reserves, could result in ceiling test impairments.  

 ﻿  

 At December 31, 2018, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $3.10 per MMBtu, for West Texas Intermediate oil of $65.56 per barrel and NGLs of $17.64 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials. The net book value of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2018. We had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2018. Although no ceiling test impairment was recorded in 2018, future decreases in commodity prices, increases in costs and/or changes in the balance of costs excluded from amortization and other factors may result in impairments to our natural gas and oil properties.

Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $2.98 per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $47.79 per barrel and NGLs of $14.41 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the net book value of our United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2017. We had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2017.  

 ﻿  

 The net book value of our United States and Canada natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $641 million (net of tax) at March 31, 2016, $297 million (net of tax) at June 30, 2016 and $506 million (net of tax) at September 30, 2016 and resulted in non-cash ceiling test impairments in each of those quarters ended those dates. We had no hedge positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016. Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $2.48 per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $39.25 per barrel and NGLs of $6.74 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the net book value of our United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2016. We had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2016.   

 ﻿  

 A decline in natural gas, oil and NGL prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves. In the past, nearly all of our reserve base was natural gas; therefore changes in oil and NGL prices used did not have as significant an impact as natural gas prices on cash flows and reserve quantities. With the sale of our Fayetteville Shale assets, our reserve base as of December 31, 2018, however, was approximately 68% natural gas, 29% NGLs and 3% oil. Therefore NGL and oil pricing will have a more significant impact on the cash flows and quantity of reserves going forward. Our standardized measure and reserve quantities as of December 31, 2018, were $6.0 billion and 11.9 Tcfe, respectively.   

 ﻿  

 Natural gas, oil and NGL reserves cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of costs that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers, who are not part of the asset management teams, and by our Director of Reserves, who is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Director of Reserves has more than 24 years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the estimation of natural gas and oil reserves, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining us in 2018, our Director of Reserves served in various reservoir engineering roles for EP Energy Company, El Paso Corporation, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, Schlumberger and H.J. Gruy & Associates, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, who has more than 30 years of experience in petroleum engineering including the estimation of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves in multiple basins in the United States, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining Southwestern in 2017, our Chief Operations Officer served in various engineering and leadership roles for EP Energy Corporation, El Paso Corporation, ARCO Oil and Gas Company, Burlington Resources and Peoples Energy Production, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.  

 ﻿  

 We engage NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-002699. Within NSAI, the two technical persons primarily responsible for auditing our proved reserves estimates (1) have over 37 years and over 16 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and petroleum engineering, respectively; (2) have over 27 years and over 16 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, respectively; (3) each has a college degree; (4) each is a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas or a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas; (5) each meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; and (6) each is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. The financial data included in the reserve estimates is also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Our proved reserves estimates, as internally reviewed and audited by NSAI, are submitted for review and approval to our Chief Executive Officer. Finally, upon his approval, NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors, with whom final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests. A copy of NSAI’s report has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.

 Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non-producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for

the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves accounted for 47% of our total reserve base as of December 31, 2018. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties.  Any material change to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of Part I of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors.  

 ﻿  

 In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAI’s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 99% of the present worth of the company’s total proved reserves. NSAI’s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves. The fields included in approximately the top 99% present value as of December 31, 2018, accounted for approximately 99% of our total proved reserves and approximately 100% of our proved undeveloped reserves. In the conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, natural gas, oil and NGL production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. On January 16, 2019, NSAI issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates for the year-ended December 31, 2018 stating that our estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

 Assets and liabilities held for sale are subject to an assessment of fair value which includes many key valuation estimates, inputs and assumptions including but not limited to: production forecasts, pricing, basis differentials, operating and general and administrative expense forecasts, future development costs, discount rate determination and tax inputs.  In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized certain assets and liabilities as held for sale related to the Fayetteville Shale sale requiring a comparison of their respective carrying cost and fair value less costs to sell.  Our full cost pool assets were excluded from held for sale accounting treatment as they are governed by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10. The fair value of our gathering assets to be sold was estimated using an estimated discounted cash flow model along with market assumptions. The assumptions used in the calculation of estimated discounted cash flows included future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of natural gas reserves, operating costs, projections of future rates of production, inflation factors and risk-adjusted discount rates. We believe the assumptions used were reasonable.

 Under full cost accounting rules, sales of oil and gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, shall be accounted for as a reduction of the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center.  For instance, a significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur for sales involving less than 25 percent of the reserve quantities of a given cost center.  Judgments are required around the determination of whether a divestment is deemed significant.  Such judgments include an assessment of the of the reserve quantities sold as compared to total reserve quantities and other qualitative and quantitative assessments of the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.  We did not recognize a gain or loss on the sale of our oil and gas properties as the divestment was deemed not significant.  Please refer to Note 3 – “Divestitures” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further detail.

 Derivatives and Risk Management  

 ﻿  

 We use fixed price swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities and interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. In 2018, 2017 and 2016 we financially protected 77%, 70% and 28% of our natural gas production, respectively, with derivatives. The primary risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for our production. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related transaction that is financially protected.

All derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability as measured at fair value other than transactions for which the normal purchase/normal sale exception is applied. Certain criteria must be satisfied for derivative financial instruments to be designated for hedge accounting. Accounting guidance for qualifying hedges allows an unsettled derivative’s unrealized gains and losses to be recorded in either earnings or as a component of other comprehensive income until settled. In the period of settlement, we recognize the gains and losses from these qualifying hedges in gas sales revenues. The ineffective portion of those fixed price swaps was recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment, or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements, are recorded as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the gain (loss) on derivatives component of the statement of operations reflects the gains and losses on both settled and unsettled derivatives. We calculate gains and losses on settled derivatives as the summation of gains and losses on positions which have settled within the reporting period.   

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018, none of our derivative contracts were designated for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of unsettled derivatives that were not designated for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in gain (loss) on derivatives. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on our derivative position at December 31, 2018.  

 ﻿  

 Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the derivative positions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We refer you to “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our hedging activities.

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

 ﻿  

 We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2018 benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost to be recorded in 2019, the discount rate assumed is 4.35%. This compares to a discount rate of 3.75% and 4.20% for the benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost, respectively, recorded in 2018. For the 2019 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed remains 7.00%, from 2018.  

 ﻿  

 Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded total benefit cost of $9 million in 2018 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Due to the significance of the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return, the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a 0.5% change in those assumptions would have had on our 2018 pension expense:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 As of December 31, 2018, we recognized a liability of $47 million, compared to $59 million at December 31, 2017, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2018, we also made cash payments totaling $13 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  

 ﻿  

 Asset Retirement Obligations   

 ﻿  

 We must plug and abandon our wells when they no longer are producing. An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is recognized as a liability in the period incurred or when it becomes determinable, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The recognition of asset retirement obligations requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rates, all of which are subject to change.

Stock-Based Compensation  

 ﻿  

 We account for stock-based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize an amount equal to the fair value of the stock options and stock-based payment cost in either the consolidated statement of operations or capitalize the cost into natural gas and oil properties or gathering systems included in property and equipment. Costs are capitalized when they are directly related to the acquisition, exploration and development activities of our natural gas and oil properties or directly related to the construction of our gathering systems. We use models to determine fair value of stock-based compensation, which requires significant judgment with respect to forfeitures, volatility and other factors.   

 ﻿  

 Our stock-based compensation is classified as either an equity award or a liability award in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value of an equity-classified award is determined at the grant date and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting life of the award. The fair-value of a liability-classified award is determined on a quarterly basis through the final vesting date and is amortized based on the current fair value of the award and the percentage of vesting period incurred to date.
