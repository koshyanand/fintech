 Consolidated Results of Operations  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017  

 Revenue. Total revenue increased $71.8 million, or 1%, to $7,791.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $7,719.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Redemption. Revenue decreased $259.0 million, or 28%, to $676.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Upon adoption of ASC 606, certain redemption revenue for which we do not control the good or service prior to transferring it to the collector is recorded on a net basis, which reduced both redemption revenue and cost of operations by $283.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $38.3 million in redemption revenue from our short-term loyalty programs due to an increase in the number of active programs in market as compared to the prior year. 

   ·    Finance charges, net. Revenue increased $523.0 million, or 13%, to $4,694.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in average credit card and loan receivables, which impacted revenue by $485.9 million through a combination of recent credit card portfolio acquisitions and new client signings, and an increase in net finance charge yield of approximately 20 basis points, which increased revenue by $37.1 million.

 Cost of operations. Cost of operations decreased $49.0 million, or 1%, to $4,220.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4,269.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net decrease resulted from the following:  

   ·    Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $230.6 million due to a $237.7 million decrease in cost of redemptions. This decrease in cost of redemptions was driven by a $283.4 million decrease related to the adoption of ASC 606 as discussed above, offset in part by the increase in cost of redemptions related to our short-term loyalty programs due to the increase in revenue.  

   ·    Within the Epsilon segment, cost of operations decreased $93.7 million, or 5%, due to a decrease in direct costs associated with a 4% decline in revenue.  

   ·    Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations increased $298.3 million due to $101.6 million in valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card and loan receivables held for sale, a $67.4 million increase in payroll and benefit expenses to support in-house collections and operational initiatives, and higher credit card processing costs attributable to increases in volume.  

 Provision for loan loss. Provision for loan loss decreased $124.1 million, or 11%, to $1,016.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the change in credit card and loan receivables in each respective period, including the impact of the classification of credit card receivables held for sale, offset in part by an increase in net charge-offs.   

 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $6.4 million, or 4%, to $172.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $166.3 million for year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in professional fees, medical benefits and charitable contributions, which were offset in part by a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses realized and a decrease in incentive compensation driven by bonuses in 2017 to our non-executive associates resulting from tax reform benefits.  

 Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization increased $13.0 million, or 7%, to $196.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to additional assets placed into service from capital expenditures.  

 Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $23.3 million, or 7%, to $291.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets, including customer databases and portfolio premiums.  

 Interest expense, net. Total interest expense, net increased $106.2 million, or 19%, to $670.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $564.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to the following:  

   ·    Securitization funding costs. Securitization funding costs increased $63.6 million due to higher average interest rates, which increased funding costs by approximately $36.6 million, and higher average borrowings, which increased funding costs by approximately $27.0 million. 

   ·    Interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits increased $40.6 million due to higher average borrowings, which increased interest expense by approximately $21.8 million, and higher average interest rates, which increased interest expense by approximately $18.8 million. 

   ·    Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net. Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net increased $2.0 million primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in interest expense on term debt and a $14.9 million increase in interest expense on the revolving line of credit due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates due to increases in the LIBOR rate. These increases were offset in part by a $37.4 million decrease in interest expense on senior notes primarily due to the repayment of senior notes in December 2017 and April 2018. 

 Taxes. Income tax expense decreased $31.8 million, or 11%, to $260.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $292.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the reduction in the federal statutory rate pursuant to tax reform enacted in December 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 21.3% as compared to 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, income tax expense in the current year was positively impacted by a tax benefit associated with a foreign restructuring in the current year.

These benefits were offset in part by the negative impact of the Supreme Court’s decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.   

 Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016  

 Revenue. Total revenue increased $581.3 million, or 8%, to $7,719.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $7,138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net increase was due to the following:  

   ·    Services. Revenue increased $107.4 million, or 4%, to $2,612.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in services provided to our Epsilon clients, driven by double-digit growth in the automotive, agency and digital CRM offerings as a result of new client signings and strength in existing client relationships. This increase was offset in part by a $28.6 million decline in Card Services merchant fees as a result of increased royalty payments associated with higher volumes and new clients. 

   ·    Redemption. Revenue decreased $58.3 million, or 6%, to $935.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as our short-term loyalty programs decreased $78.6 million as a result of softness due to the number and timing of campaigns in 2017 as compared to the prior year. Redemption revenue for our coalition loyalty program increased $20.3 million, as the prior year was negatively impacted $284.5 million due to our change in the breakage rate from 26% to 20% in December 2016, offset by a 36% decrease in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed in 2017 as compared to the prior year. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Cost of operations. Cost of operations decreased $6.9 million to $4,269.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4,276.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease resulted from the following:  

   ·    Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $220.4 million due to a 24% decrease in cost of redemptions associated with the decrease in redemption revenue.  

   ·    Within the Epsilon segment, cost of operations increased $121.0 million due to a 9%, or $72.0 million, increase in direct processing expenses associated with the increase in revenue as well as a 5%, or $49.0 million, increase in payroll and benefit expenses, including an increase of $31.1 million associated with incentive compensation expense and commissions as compared to the prior year. 

   ·    Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations increased $89.7 million. Payroll and benefit expenses increased $71.2 million due to an increase in the number of associates to support growth and operational initiatives, and other operating expenses increased $18.5 million as a result of higher credit card processing costs due to increases in volume associated with growth in credit card and loan receivables. 

 Provision for loan loss. Provision for loan loss increased $199.6 million, or 21%, to $1,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $940.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the provision for loan loss was driven by higher principal losses as well as an increase in credit card and loan receivables. The net charge-off rate was 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Delinquency rates were 5.1% of principal credit card and loan receivables at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.8% at December 31, 2016.  

 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $23.1 million, or 16%, to $166.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $143.2 million for year ended December 31, 2016, due to an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses recognized of $7.8 million and a 16% increase in payroll and benefits expense, driven by a $12.0 million increase in bonuses to our non-executive associates resulting from tax reform benefits.

 Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization increased $16.0 million, or 10%, to $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $167.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to additional assets placed into service from capital expenditures.  

 Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $30.5 million, or 9%, to $314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $345.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets at Epsilon and LoyaltyOne.  

 Interest expense, net. Total interest expense, net increased $135.9 million, or 32%, to $564.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $428.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to the following:  

   ·    Securitization funding costs. Securitization funding costs increased $31.0 million due to higher average interest rates, which increased funding costs by approximately $18.1 million, and higher average borrowings, which increased funding costs by approximately $12.9 million. 

   ·    Interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits increased $40.4 million due to higher average borrowings, which increased interest expense by approximately $25.9 million, and higher average interest rates, which increased interest expense by approximately $14.5 million. 

   ·    Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net. Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net increased $64.5 million primarily due to the issuance of new senior notes in October 2016 and March 2017, which increased interest expense by an aggregate of $38.8 million. Additionally, interest expense on term debt increased $19.0 million due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates due to increases in the LIBOR rate, and amortization of debt issuance costs increased $4.8 million. 

 Taxes. Income tax expense decreased $27.0 million, or 8%, to $292.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $319.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 27.0% as compared to 38.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our year-over-year effective tax rate decrease resulted primarily from the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, as the Company was required to write-down the value of our net U.S. deferred tax liability from 35% to 21% as a result of the change in the federal statutory tax rate. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards which are now no longer more likely than not to be utilized as a result of the tax reform legislation. Our 2016 effective tax rate was impacted by the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, particularly the decrease in lower taxed Canadian earnings related to the change in estimate of our breakage rate in December 2016.  

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, plus stock compensation expense, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation and other amortization, and amortization of purchased intangibles.  

 In 2018, adjusted EBITDA excluded costs related to the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Epsilon segment. In 2016, adjusted EBITDA excluded the impact of the cancellation of the AIR MILES Reward Program’s five-year expiry policy on December 1, 2016. In 2015, adjusted EBITDA excluded costs associated with the consent orders with the FDIC, and in 2014, adjusted EBITDA excluded business acquisition costs related to the acquisition of Conversant and the contingent consideration incurred as a result of the earn-out obligation associated with the BrandLoyalty acquisition. These costs, as well as stock compensation expense, were not included in the measurement of segment adjusted EBITDA as the chief operating decision maker did not factor these expenses for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations.  

 Adjusted EBITDA, net is also a non-GAAP financial measure equal to adjusted EBITDA less securitization funding costs, interest expense on deposits and adjusted EBITDA attributable to the non-controlling interest. Effective April 1, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in BrandLoyalty, which increased our ownership percentage to 100%.  

 We use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management, and we believe it provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations. Adjusted 

 33  

 Table of Contents  

EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are each considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net eliminate the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, including certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net also eliminate the non-cash effect of stock compensation expense.  

 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

 The adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

 Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017  

 Revenue. Total revenue increased $71.8 million, or 1%, to $7,791.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $7,719.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:  

   ·    LoyaltyOne. Revenue decreased $235.1 million, or 18%, to $1,068.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606, which negatively impacted revenue by $283.4 million. This decrease was offset in part by a 12% increase in revenue from our short-term loyalty programs primarily due to an increase in the number of active programs in market. 

   ·    Epsilon. Revenue decreased $97.0 million, or 4%, to $2,175.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to declines in agency and site-based display product offerings as compared to the prior year.  

   ·    Card Services. Revenue increased $427.0 million, or 10%, to $4,597.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by a $523.0 million increase in finance charges, net as a result of an 8% increase in average credit card and loan receivables. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in servicing fees of $96.0 million, as merchant fee revenue declined $75.2 million due to increased royalty payments to our retailers associated with higher volumes and new clients, and other servicing fees charged to cardholders declined $19.2 million due in part to a decline in revenue from certain payment protection products. 

 Adjusted EBITDA, net. Adjusted EBITDA, net increased $143.3 million, or 7%, to $2,079.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1,936.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:  

   ·    LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $2.5 million, or 1%, to $254.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of lower margin programs in key markets within our short-term loyalty programs and weakened performance in Asia.  

   ·    Epsilon. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $0.6 million to $475.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the decrease in revenue, offset in part by a favorable revenue mix toward higher margin product offerings in the current year as compared to the prior year. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Corporate/Other. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $4.7 million to a loss of $145.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to an increase in professional fees, medical benefits and charitable contributions, which

were offset by a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses realized and a decrease in incentive compensation driven by bonuses in 2017 to our non-executive associates resulting from tax reform benefits. 

 Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016  

 Revenue. Total revenue increased $581.3 million, or 8%, to $7,719.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $7,138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net increase was due to the following:  

   ·    LoyaltyOne. Revenue decreased $34.4 million, or 3%, to $1,303.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as revenue from our short-term loyalty programs decreased $78.6 million as a result of softness due to the number and timing of campaigns in 2017 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was offset in part by a $44.2 million increase in revenue from our coalition loyalty program, as the prior year was negatively impacted $284.5 million due to our change in the breakage rate from 26% to 20% in December 2016 but offset by a 36% decrease in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed in 2017.  

   ·    Epsilon. Revenue increased $116.9 million, or 5%, to $2,272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 driven by double-digit growth in the automotive, agency and digital CRM offerings from a combination of new clients and strength in existing client relationships.  

   ·    Card Services. Revenue increased $495.6 million, or 13%, to $4,170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by a $532.2 million increase in finance charges, net as a result of an increase in average credit card and loan receivables due to recent portfolio acquisitions and strong cardholder spending. Servicing fees decreased $36.6 million, as merchant fees declined $28.6 million due to increased royalty payments associated with higher volumes and new clients, and other servicing fees declined $8.0 million. 

 Adjusted EBITDA, net. Adjusted EBITDA, net increased $56.5 million, or 3%, to $1,936.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1,880.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net increase was due to the following:  

   ·    LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $52.2 million, or 17%, to $256.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to underperformance of our short-term loyalty programs in the current year as well as a decline in our coalition loyalty program driven by a decrease in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed and our change in the breakage rate. In the prior year, adjusted EBITDA, net was reduced by $5.5 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to the non-controlling interest. Effective April 1, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in BrandLoyalty to bring our ownership percentage to 100%. 

   ·    Epsilon. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $4.5 million, or 1%, to $475.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the restoration of incentive compensation expense in 2017.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Corporate/Other. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $18.4 million to a loss of $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to higher payroll and benefit costs, which included a $12.0 million increase in bonuses to our non-executive associates resulting from tax reform benefits, as well as an increase in charitable contributions and higher net foreign currency exchange losses recognized in the current year. 

 Asset Quality  

 Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of our credit card and loan receivables, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions.   

 Delinquencies. A credit card account is contractually delinquent when we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder’s statement. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged-off, in the month during which an account becomes 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, a message is printed on the credit cardholder’s billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically 

 36  

 Table of Contents  

scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.  

 The following table presents the delinquency trends of our credit card and loan receivables portfolio:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Net Charge-Offs. Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off in each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame.  

 The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs of principal receivables for the period by the average credit card and loan receivables for the period. Average credit card and loan receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the periods indicated. The following table presents our net charge-offs for the periods indicated:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities, our credit agreements and issuances of debt or equity securities, our credit card securitization program and deposits issued by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. In addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current liquidity sources, we continue to seek new funding sources, including our plan to enter the consumer deposit market for Comenity Capital Bank in 2019.  

 Our primary uses of cash are for ongoing business operations, repayments of our debt, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends.  

 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  

 We believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed below will be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.

 Operating Activities. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $2,754.9 million and $2,599.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows of $155.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in profitability.

Cash decreased $231.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we increased funding to the redemption settlement assets as a result of the breakage rate change in December 2016. 

   ·    Credit card and loan receivables. Cash decreased $2,749.6 million and $3,600.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, due to growth in credit card and loan receivables in each respective year. 

   ·    Proceeds from sale of credit card and loan portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received cash consideration of $1,153.5 million from the sale of six credit card portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received cash consideration of $797.7 million from the sale of two credit card and loan portfolios. 

   ·    Payments for acquired businesses, net of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired credit card receivables and the associated accounts and assumed a portion of an existing customer care operation, including a facility sublease agreement and approximately 250 employees, from Signet for cash consideration of approximately $945.6 million.  

   ·    Capital expenditures. Cash paid for capital expenditures was $199.8 million and $225.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures to continue to be approximately 3% of annual revenue. 

 Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $1,217.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and cash provided by financing activities was $4,004.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Significant components of financing activities are as follows:  

   ·    Debt. Cash decreased $317.7 million in net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the early repayment of $500.0 million senior notes due in 2020. Cash increased $355.3 million in net borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the issuance of €400.0 million senior notes due in 2022 and additional term loan and revolving line of credit net borrowings, offset in part by the repayment of $400.0 million senior notes due in 2017. 

   ·    Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities. Cash decreased $1,156.4 million in net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $985.0 million in net repayments under the conduit facilities and $171.4 million in net maturities under the asset-backed term notes. Cash increased $1,852.2 million in net borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to $1,410.0 million in net borrowings under the conduit facilities and $442.2 million in net borrowings under the asset-backed term notes.  

   ·    Deposits. Cash increased $864.1 million and $2,543.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, due to new issuances, offset in part by timing of maturities. 

   ·    Dividends. Cash paid for quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents was $125.2 million and $115.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

   ·    Treasury shares. Cash paid for treasury shares was $443.2 million and $553.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

 Debt  

 Long-term and Other Debt  

 At December 31, 2018, our credit agreement, as amended, provided for a $3,052.6 million term loan, subject to certain repayments, and a $1,572.4 million revolving line of credit. The loans are scheduled to mature on June 14, 2022.  

 As of December 31, 2018, we had $740.0 million outstanding under our revolving line of credit and total availability of $832.4 million. Our total leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 2.3 to 1 at December 31, 2018, as compared to the maximum covenant ratio of 3.5 to 1.   

 In April 2018, we redeemed our $500.0 million outstanding 6.375% senior notes due April 1, 2020 at par plus accrued interest. We funded the redemption with borrowings under our revolving line of credit.  

 The BrandLoyalty credit agreement, as amended in June 2016, provided for a reduction in commitment on each of the uncommitted and committed revolving lines of credit of €25.0 million in August 2018, reducing the total capacity from €125.0 million to €75.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had €37.6 million ($43.2 million) outstanding under the revolving lines of credit in the BrandLoyalty credit agreement.  

 As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.  

 See Note 12, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.  

 Deposits  

 We utilize money market deposits and certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities, including funding for our non-securitized credit card receivables, and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our bank subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank.   

 Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank offer non-maturity deposit programs through contractual arrangements with various financial counterparties. As of December 31, 2018, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank had $3.4 billion in money market deposits outstanding with interest rates ranging from 1.90% to 2.71%. Money market deposits are redeemable on demand by the customer and, as such, have no scheduled maturity date.   

 Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank issue certificates of deposit in denominations of at least $100,000 and $1,000, respectively, in various maturities ranging between January 2019 and December 2023 and with effective annual interest rates ranging from 1.25% to 4.00%. As of December 31, 2018, we had $8.4 billion of certificates of deposit outstanding. Certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements.  

 Securitization Program  

 We sell a majority of the credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank to WFN Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, or Master Trust I, and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III, or Master Trust III, or collectively, the WFN Trusts, as part of our credit card securitization program, which has been in existence since January 1996. We also sell our credit card receivables originated by Comenity Capital Bank to World Financial Capital Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Capital Master Note Trust, or the WFC Trust. These securitization programs are a principal vehicle through which we finance Comenity Bank’s and Comenity Capital Bank’s credit card receivables. Historically, we have used both public and private term asset-backed securitization transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our securitized credit card receivables. Private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset-backed securitization transactions.  

 During the year ended December 31, 2018, Master Trust I issued $1.3 billion of asset-backed term notes with various maturities ranging between February 2021 and October 2021, of which $96.9 million were retained by us and eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, $1.7 billion of asset-backed term notes matured and were repaid, of which $386.2 million were retained by us and eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets.  

 39  

 Table of Contents  

 As of December 31, 2018, the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust had approximately $13.4 billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits, additional receivables and subordinated classes. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust and by the performance of the credit card receivables in these credit card securitization trusts. We have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of securitized credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. However, certain of these commitments are short-term in nature and subject to renewal. There is not a guarantee that these funding sources, when they mature, will be renewed on similar terms or at all as they are dependent on the asset-backed securitization markets at the time.  

 We have access to committed undrawn capacity through three conduit facilities to support the funding of our credit card receivables through Master Trust I, Master Trust III and the WFC Trust. As of December 31, 2018, total capacity under the conduit facilities was $4.5 billion, of which $2.8 billion had been drawn and was included in non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities in the consolidated balance sheets. Borrowings outstanding under each facility bear interest at a margin above LIBOR or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each individual conduit provider. The conduits have varying maturities from November 2019 to September 2020 with variable interest rates ranging from 3.48% to 3.79% as of December 31, 2018.   

 In August 2018, Master Trust I amended its 2009-VFN conduit facility, increasing the capacity from $800.0 million to $1,180.0 million and extending the maturity to September 2020.  

 In August 2018, Master Trust III amended its 2009-VFC conduit facility, decreasing the capacity from $1,680.0 million to $1,300.0 million and extending the maturity to September 2020.  

 The following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of December 31, 2018 for the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust by year:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)    Amount represents borrowing capacity, not outstanding borrowings. 

   (2)    Total amounts do not include $1.8 billion of debt issued by the credit card securitization trusts, which was retained by us and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 

 Early amortization events as defined within each asset-backed securitization transaction are generally driven by asset performance. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that an early amortization event will occur due to asset performance. However, if an early amortization event were declared, the trustee of the particular credit card securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the credit card securitization investors were fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card receivables.  

 See Note 12, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our securitized debt.  

 Stock Repurchase Programs  

 We had an authorized stock repurchase program to acquire up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock through July 31, 2018. At July 31, 2018, $280.3 million of this program expired unused. On July 26, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had $222.8 million remaining under the stock repurchase program.   

 40  

 Table of Contents  

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $443.2 million.  

 See “Stock Repurchase Programs” under Note 15, “Stockholders’ Equity,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.   

 Dividends  

 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.57 per share for a total of $125.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.52 per share for a total of $115.5 million.  

 On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on our common stock, payable on March 19, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2019.  

 Contractual Obligations   

 In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period as of December 31, 2018 are summarized below:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)    The deposits, non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and long-term and other debt represent our estimated debt service obligations, including both principal and interest. Interest was based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018, applied to the contractual repayment period. 

   (2)    ASC 740 obligations do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $293.6 million, of which the timing remains uncertain. 

   (3)    Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. Purchase obligations include sponsor commitments under our AIR MILES Reward Program, minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services. 

 We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments.  

 Inflation and Seasonality  

 Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale, technology and expansion in lower cost jurisdictions in select circumstances, as well as decreases in technology and communication costs, to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses. With respect to seasonality, our revenues, earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the third and fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter as credit card and note receivable balances are paid down.

 Legislative and Regulatory Matters  

 Comenity Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the State of Delaware and the FDIC. Comenity Capital Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the FDIC and the State of Utah. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by these regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are limited in the amounts that they can pay as dividends to us.  

 Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are considered well capitalized. The actual capital ratios and minimum ratios as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In September 2015, each bank entered into a consent order with the FDIC in settlement of the FDIC’s review regarding the marketing, promotion and sale of certain add-on products; these consent orders were terminated in August 2018.  

 In August 2014, the SEC adopted a number of rules that will change the disclosure, reporting and offering process for publicly registered offerings of asset-backed securities, including those offered under our credit card securitization program. A number of rules proposed by the SEC in 2010 and 2011, such as requiring group-level data for the underlying assets in credit card securitizations, were not adopted in 2014 but may be implemented by the SEC in the future with or without modifications. The SEC has also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the exemptions that our credit card securitization trusts rely on in our credit card securitization program to avoid registration as investment companies.  

 Regulations adopted by the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve and certain other federal regulators mandate a minimum five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations issued on and after December 24, 2016, known as Regulation RR. Such risk retention requirements may limit our liquidity by restricting the amount of asset-backed securities we are able to issue or affecting the timing of future issuances of asset-backed securities; we intend to satisfy such risk retention requirements by maintaining a seller’s interest calculated in accordance with Regulation RR.  

 Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates  

 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of 

 42  

 Table of Contents  

our financial condition and operating results. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management’s most subjective judgments. The primary critical accounting estimates are described below.   

 Allowance for Loan Loss.   

 We maintain an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card and loan receivables. The estimate of our allowance for loan loss considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the credit card and loan receivables. While our estimation process includes historical data and analysis, there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results to determine the allowance for loan loss. We use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The considerations in these analyses include past and current credit card and loan performance, seasoning and growth, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. Given the same information, others may reach different reasonable estimates.  

 If we used different assumptions in estimating net charge-offs that could be incurred, the impact to the allowance for loan loss could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 100 basis point change in our estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $176 million in the allowance for loan loss at December 31, 2018, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan loss.  

 Revenue Recognition.   

 We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In that determination, under ASC 606, we follow a five-step model that includes: (1) determination of whether a contract, an agreement between two or more parties that creates legally enforceable rights and obligations, exists; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.  

 We enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price based on either the adjusted market assessment or cost plus a margin approach.   

 Certain of our contracts may provide for variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on either the expected amount or most likely amount to be provided to the customer to determine the transaction price for the contract. The estimation method is consistent for contracts with similar terms and is applied consistently throughout each contract. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available.  

 AIR MILES Reward Program. The AIR MILES Reward Program collects fees from its sponsors based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of redemption and service revenue is deferred. Under certain of our contracts, a portion of the consideration is paid to us upon the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption and therefore, we do not have a redemption obligation related to these contracts.   

 Total consideration from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles is allocated to three performance obligations: redemption, service, and brand, based on a relative standalone selling price basis.   

 The estimated standalone selling price for the redemption and the service performance obligations are based on cost plus a reasonable margin. The estimated standalone selling price of the brand performance obligation is determined using a relief from royalty approach. Accordingly, management determines the estimated standalone selling price by 

 43  

 Table of Contents  

considering multiple inputs and methods, including discounted cash flows and available market data in consideration of applicable margins and royalty rates to utilize. The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and redeemed are factored into the estimates, as management estimates the standalone selling prices and volumes over the term of the respective agreements in order to determine the allocation of consideration to each performance obligation delivered. The redemption performance obligation incorporates the expected number of AIR MILES reward miles to be redeemed, and therefore, the amount of redemption revenue recognized is subject to management’s estimate of breakage, or those AIR MILES reward miles estimated to be unredeemed by the collector base. Additionally, the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile impacts the timing of revenue recognition.  

 Breakage and the life of an AIR MILES reward mile are based on management’s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent factors, such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure.   

 Throughout 2017 and 2018, our estimated breakage rate remained 20%. Our cumulative redemption rate, which represents program to date redemptions divided by program to date issuance, is 69% as of December 31, 2018. We expect the ultimate redemption rate will approximate 80% based on our historical redemption patterns, statistical regression models, and consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable.  

 During 2017, we changed our estimated life of a mile from 42 months to 38 months, which had an impact to revenue of approximately $20 million. Throughout 2018, our estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile remained 38 months. We estimate that a change to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile of one month would impact revenue by approximately $4 million.   

 Any future changes in collector behavior could result in further changes in our estimates of breakage or life of an AIR MILES reward mile.  

 As of December 31, 2018, we had $875.3 million in deferred revenue related to the AIR MILES Reward Program that will be recognized in the future. Further information is provided in Note 3, “Revenue,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Goodwill.  

 We test goodwill for impairment annually, as of July 31, or when events and circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we must estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. As of December 31, 2018, we had goodwill of approximately $3.8 billion. The following table presents the December 31, 2018 goodwill by reporting unit as well as the percentage by which fair value of the reporting units exceeded carrying value as of the 2018 annual impairment test:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We estimated the fair value of the reporting units using both an income- and market-based approach. Our income-based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's estimates of forecasted cash flows, with those cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. The valuation includes assumptions related to revenue growth and profit performance, capital expenditures, the discount rate and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our tests for goodwill impairment. The market-based approach involves an analysis of market multiples of revenues and earnings to a group of comparable public companies and recent transactions, if any, involving comparable companies. While the guideline companies in the market-based valuation method have comparability to the reporting units, they may not fully reflect the market share, product portfolio and operations of the reporting units. In addition, we also consult independent valuation experts in applying these valuation techniques.  

 44  

 Table of Contents  

 We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market-based valuation approach.   

 As with all assumptions, there is an inherent level of uncertainty and actual results, to the extent they differ from those assumptions, could have a material impact on fair value. For example, a reduction in customer demand would impact our assumed growth rate resulting in a reduced fair value, or multiples for similar type reporting units could deteriorate due to changes in technology or a downturn in economic conditions. Potential events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value. The loss of a major customer or program could have a significant impact on the future cash flows of the reporting unit(s).   

 We do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.   

 Income Taxes.   

 We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 740, “Income Taxes.” The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time. Changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. See Note 18, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding ASC 740.  

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

 See “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” under Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of certain accounting standards that we have recently adopted and certain accounting standards that we have not yet been required to adopt and may be applicable to our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
