ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids (NGL). Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.

Overview of 2018 Results

Apache’s mission is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders. Apache is focused on rigorous portfolio management, disciplined financial structure, and optimization of returns. The Company primarily focused its 2018 capital program on developing Alpine High, building associated Alpine High infrastructure, and increasing production and performance in its other Permian Basin plays.

Apache’s U.S. assets are complemented by its international assets in Egypt and the North Sea, each of which adds to the Company’s deep inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generates cash flows in excess of current capital investments, facilitating the Company’s ability to develop Alpine High while maintaining financial flexibility.

In November 2018 the Company completed a transaction with Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corp. to create a publicly traded, pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by Apache’s gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High with ownership or options for participation in five joint venture pipelines. This strategic transaction facilitates funding the capital intensive midstream infrastructure and enhances the allocation of Apache’s capital to further development of the vast Alpine High upstream resource base, while maintaining control and a significant stake in the contributed assets. For further information regarding this transaction, please see “Operational Highlights” below, and also refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

During 2018, Apache reported net income attributable to common stock of $40 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $3.41 per share in 2017. The 2018 results include asset impairments of $511 million as the Company continues to redirect capital from non-core assets and a $94 million charge for early extinguishment of debt. These charges directly impact comparability to the prior year and partially offset realized benefits from higher average crude oil and NGL prices and production. Additionally, 2017 results were materially benefited from a $627 million gain on asset sales.

Daily production in 2018 averaged 466 Mboe/d, an increase of 2 percent from 2017. Excluding asset divestitures, Apache’s worldwide equivalent daily production increased 9 percent, driven primarily by activity in the Permian Basin. Realized oil prices in 2018 were considerably higher than the previous year, particularly Dated Brent, which has provided increased operating cash flow to reinvest in the Company’s core development areas.

Apache generated $3.8 billion in cash from operating activities in 2018, up $1.3 billion from the prior year, $628 million of cash proceeds from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in its Alpine High midstream assets, and an additional $138 million of cash proceeds from non-core asset and leasehold divestments. Apache ended the year with $714 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $954 million from year-end 2017. Apache continuously monitors changes in its operating environment and has the ability, with its dynamic capital allocation process, to adjust the Company’s capital investment program to levels commensurate with cash from operating activities and to maximize value for Apache’s shareholders over the long term. During the year, the Company took several steps to improve its debt portfolio, issuing $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and concurrently repurchasing $731 million in aggregate principal amount of certain outstanding notes. These transactions extended debt maturities, reduced the Company’s cost of debt, modernized its standard indenture terms, and, in conjunction with the repayment of $550 million of debt that matured during 2018, reduced debt by $281 million from 2017 year-end levels. In late 2018, the Company re-initiated share repurchase activity under its existing authorization and repurchased over 7.8 million shares. Since the inception of the program in 2013, the Company has purchased approximately 40 million shares through the end of 2018. The Company also obtained authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors to purchase an additional 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock.

Operational Highlights

Key operational highlights for the year include:

United States

•U.S. onshore production averaged 256 Mboe/d, up 28 percent relative to 2017, reflecting the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp-up at Alpine High.

•The Permian region averaged 17 operated rigs during the year, drilling 284 gross wells. Approximately 43 percent of the region’s production is crude oil and 21 percent is NGLs. Combined, this represents 44 percent of Apache’s worldwide liquids production for 2018. The region averaged 211 Mboe/d and contributed $2.7 billion of revenues during 2018. Fourth-quarter 2018 production increased 33 percent from the comparative 2017 quarter, a reflection of the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp-up at Alpine High.

•In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the previously announced agreement with Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corp. (KAAC) and its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Subsequent to the transaction, KAAC was renamed to Altus Midstream Company (ALTM).

◦Upon closing of the transaction, KAAC contributed approximately $628 million of cash, net of transaction expenses, into Altus Midstream LP. The cash will primarily be used to fund future development of the Alpine High midstream assets.

◦In exchange for the contribution of its Alpine High midstream assets, Apache received an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in Altus. 

◦Altus owns gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream contracts to service Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. Altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transportation services. Additionally, Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries have equity ownership in third-party pipeline projects and hold options to purchase equity ownerships in other pipeline projects in the region.

International[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The North Sea region averaged 3 rigs during 2018, drilling 10 gross wells. During the year, the region averaged production of 56 Mboe/d and contributed $1.3 billion of revenues. Production declined 3 percent from 2017, primarily the result of natural decline offset by a development well coming online at the Callater field and initial production at Garten during the fourth quarter of 2018.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

Over Apache’s 60-year history, the Company has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize Apache’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, Apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance Apache’s portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of Apache’s operations in Canada and Australia. These divestments include:

•U.S. and North Sea Divestitures During 2018, in addition to the Altus transaction discussed above, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the U.S. and North Sea regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of approximately $138 million.

•Canadian Operations On June 30, 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian assets at Midale and House Mountain for total cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. In August of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its remaining Canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million. 

 29

•U.S. Leasehold Divestitures During 2017, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the Permian and Midcontinent/Gulf Coast regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $798 million.

•North Sea Gathering Transportation and Processing (GTP) Facility In November 2017, Apache completed the sale of its 30.28 percent interest in the SAGE gas plant and its 60.56 percent interest in the Beryl pipeline in the North Sea to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited. A refundable deposit of $134 million was received in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with this transaction, and was recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In November 2017, Apache completed the sale and the liability related to the refundable deposit was released. No additional proceeds were received.

For detailed information regarding Apache’s acquisitions and divestitures, please refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Crude Oil Prices

A substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for 2018 were up 27 percent compared to 2017, a direct result of the rising benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in 2018 averaged $65.30 per barrel.

Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.

Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NGL Prices

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

Crude Oil Revenues

2018 vs. 2017 Crude oil revenues for 2018 totaled $5.8 billion, a $1.2 billion increase from the 2017 total of $4.6 billion, primarily a result of 27 percent higher average realized prices. Average daily production in 2018 was 245.4 Mb/d, with prices averaging $65.30 per barrel. Crude oil accounted for 80 percent of Apache’s 2018 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of its worldwide production.

Worldwide crude oil production increased 1.1 Mb/d compared to 2017, primarily the result of the drilling program in the Permian region offset by the Canada divestitures and natural decline. 

2017 vs. 2016 Crude oil revenues for 2017 totaled $4.6 billion, a $426 million increase from the 2016 total of $4.2 billion. An 11 percent decrease in average daily production reduced 2017 revenues by $559 million compared to 2016, while 24 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $985 million. Average daily production in 2017 was 244.3 Mb/d, with prices averaging $51.46 per barrel. Crude oil accounted for 78 percent of Apache’s 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of its worldwide production.

Worldwide crude oil production decreased 31.0 Mb/d compared to 2016, primarily the result of the Canada divestitures and natural decline.

Natural Gas Revenues

2018 vs. 2017 Natural gas revenues for 2018 totaled $919 million, a $40 million decrease from the 2017 total of $959 million. A 1 percent increase in average production increased 2018 revenues by $7 million compared to 2017, while 5 percent lower average realized prices decreased revenues by $47 million. Average daily production in 2018 was 966 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $2.61 per Mcf. Natural gas accounted for 12 percent of Apache’s 2018 oil and gas production revenues and 34 percent of its worldwide production.

Worldwide gas production increased 8.0 MMcf/d compared to 2017, primarily the result of the Alpine High development partially offset by the Canada divestitures and natural decline. 

2017 vs. 2016 Natural gas revenues for 2017 totaled $959 million, an $8 million decrease from the 2016 total of $967 million. A 13 percent decrease in average production reduced 2017 revenues by $148 million compared to 2016, while 14 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $140 million. Average daily production in 2017 was 958 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $2.74 per Mcf. Natural gas accounted for 16 percent of Apache’s 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 35 percent of its worldwide production.

Worldwide gas production decreased 145.0 MMcf/d compared to 2016, primarily the result of the Canada divestitures, maintenance activities in the North Sea, and natural decline.

NGL Revenues

2018 vs. 2017 NGL revenues for 2018 totaled $583 million, a $253 million increase from 2017. An 11 percent increase in average production increased 2018 revenues by $59 million compared to 2017, while 59 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $194 million. Average daily production in 2018 was 59.6 Mb/d, with prices averaging $26.87 per barrel. NGLs accounted for nearly 8 percent of Apache’s 2018 oil and gas production revenues and 13 percent of its worldwide production.

2017 vs. 2016 NGL revenues for 2017 totaled $330 million, a $102 million increase from 2016. A 15 percent decrease in average production reduced 2017 revenues by $58 million compared to 2016, while 70 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $160 million. Average daily production in 2017 was 53.5 Mb/d, with prices averaging $16.90 per barrel. NGLs accounted for nearly 6 percent of Apache’s 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 12 percent of its worldwide production.

 34

Altus Revenues

Apache is the largest single owner of the voting common stock of ALTM, and has an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus. Altus generates revenue primarily by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transportation services. Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play, which commenced production in May 2017. The amount and pace of upstream development activity by Apache of its Alpine High play will impact Altus’s aggregate gathering and processing volumes over time. Additionally, other producers are also developing oil and gas plays in surrounding areas that are expected to provide attractive opportunities to enter into third-party processing and gathering agreements.

During 2018 and 2017, midstream services revenues totaling $77 million and $15 million, respectively, were generated through fee-based contractual arrangements with Apache and eliminated upon consolidation. Altus did not generate any services revenues in 2016.

Operating Expenses

The table below presents a comparison of the Company’s expenses on an absolute dollar basis. The Company’s discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt and ALTM. Operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in Australia.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)

LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed more than half of Apache’s 2018 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.

During 2018, LOE increased $55 million, or 4 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2017. On a per-unit basis, LOE increased $0.19, or 2 percent compared to 2017, from $8.28 per boe to $8.47 per boe. The increase in both absolute dollar basis and per-unit basis is primarily a result of rising costs commensurate with higher commodity prices realized during 2018. During 2017, LOE decreased $110 million, or 7 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2016. On a per-unit basis, LOE increased $0.43, or 5 percent, compared to 2016. The per-barrel increase during 2017 is primarily the result of declines in production combined with generally rising costs commensurate with higher commodity prices realized during 2017. 

 35

Gathering, Transmission, and Processing

Gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) expenses include upstream transmission costs paid to a third-party carrier and to Altus, as well as costs associated with gas processing. GTP expenses also include midstream operating costs incurred by Altus. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs. 2017 GTP costs increased $153 million from 2017. Upstream transmission and processing costs increased from $1.16 per boe in 2017 to $2.16 per boe in 2018. The increase is primarily the result of the reclassification of certain transportation charges from revenues to GTP expense as a result of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting rules effective January 1, 2018, as well as the ramp-up of midstream operations at Alpine High, partially offset by Apache’s exit from Canada.

2017 vs. 2016 GTP costs decreased $5 million from 2016. The decrease was directly related to the Canadian divestitures that closed in August 2017.

Taxes Other Than Income

Taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the U.S. and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. We are also subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes.

2018 vs. 2017 Taxes other than income totaled $215 million, an increase of $64 million from 2017. The increase is primarily a result of severance taxes being impacted by higher production in the Permian region and higher commodity prices during 2018 compared to 2017.

2017 vs. 2016 Taxes other than income totaled $151 million in 2017, an increase of $25 million from 2016. The increase is primarily a result of higher commodity prices during 2017 compared to 2016.

Exploration Expense

Exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs. 2017 Unproved leasehold impairments decreased $32 million and dry hole expense decreased $46 million compared to 2017, primarily related to higher exploratory well success rates compared to the prior year. Delay rentals and other exploration lease maintenance costs trended higher in 2018 to preserve key acreage holdings, reflecting the increase in “Exploration overhead and other.”

 36

2017 vs. 2016 Unproved leasehold impairments decreased $26 million compared to 2016, primarily a result of stabilized commodity and leasehold prices during 2017. Dry hole expense increased $102 million compared to 2016, primarily related to unsuccessful international offshore exploration.

General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses

2018 vs. 2017 G&A expenses increased $36 million, or 9 percent, from 2017. The increase in G&A expense was primarily related to higher incentive and stock-based compensation in 2018 compared to 2017, slightly offset by the Canadian divestitures during 2017.

2017 vs. 2016 G&A expenses decreased $15 million, or 4 percent, from 2016. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily related to lower incentive compensation in 2017 compared to 2016, and the Canadian divestitures.

Transaction, Reorganization, and Separation Costs

Apache recorded $28 million, $16 million and $39 million of expenses during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily related to company reorganization, including separation costs, investment banking fees and other associated costs. The charges for 2018 include $22 million for consulting and legal fees related to divestitures and the Altus transaction and $6 million related to employee separation and other reorganization efforts.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)

2018 vs. 2017 Oil and gas property DD&A expense of $2.3 billion in 2018 increased $129 million compared to 2017. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate increased $0.55 per boe in 2018 compared to 2017, from $12.78 to $13.33. The primary factor driving higher absolute dollar expense was an increase in capital spending primarily in the Permian and Alpine High regions as a result of drilling and development activity. The increase on an absolute dollar basis was partially offset by the sale of Apache’s Canadian operations. GTP depreciation increased $10 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily a result of capital spending on Altus infrastructure. Other asset depreciation decreased $14 million compared to 2017 as a result of the Canadian divestiture.

2017 vs. 2016 Oil and gas property DD&A expense of $2.1 billion in 2017 decreased $324 million compared to 2016. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased $0.14 to $12.78 per boe in 2017 compared to 2016. The primary factor driving lower absolute dollar expense was a decrease in production volumes from the comparative prior-year periods. Other asset depreciation decreased $18 million compared to 2016 primarily related to Canadian divestitures.

Impairments

During 2018, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $511 million in connection with fair value assessments, including $328 million for oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. and Egypt, $56 million impairment of a gathering and processing facility in Oklahoma, $113 million for the impairment of an equity method investment based on a negotiated sales price, a $10 million impairment on the carrying values of the associated capitalized exploratory well costs related to the sale of unproved properties in the North Sea, and $4 million for inventory write-downs.

During 2017, the Company recorded asset impairments in connection with fair value assessments totaling $8 million for a U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the North Sea.

During 2016, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.1 billion in connection with fair value assessments, including $486 million for the impairment of the recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset, $427 million impairments of oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. and Canada, $135 million impairments of certain GTP facilities in the North Sea, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. 

 37

The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for 2018, 2017, and 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financing Costs, Net

Financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 vs. 2017 Net financing costs increased $81 million from 2017. The increase is primarily related to a $94 million loss on extinguishment of debt, an increase of $3 million in interest income, a decrease of $7 million in capitalized interest, and a decrease of $16 million in interest expense.

2017 vs. 2016 Net financing costs decreased $20 million from 2016. The decrease is primarily related to an increase of $11 million in interest income, an increase of $3 million in capitalized interest, and a decrease of $7 million in interest expense.

Provision for Income Taxes

The 2018 income tax expense totaled $672 million. During 2018, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) and an increase in the Company’s valuation allowance.

On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. In addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the Act move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. As a result of the enacted legislation, taxpayers were required to include in taxable income for the tax year ending December 31, 2017, the pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder. In 2017, the Company recorded a $419 million provisional deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings required under the Act.

Also on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which provides guidance for the application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, for the income tax effects of the Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the Act. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional $103 million deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This deferred tax expense combined with the provisional amount recorded in 2017 were fully offset by available foreign tax credits. The Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the Act in the fourth quarter of 2018.

 38

The 2017 income tax benefit totaled $585 million. During 2017, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the decrease in deferred taxes associated with its investments in foreign subsidiaries, gains on the sale of oil and gas properties, the increase in the Company’s valuation allowance, and a decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate causing a remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax asset.

The 2016 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $442 million. During 2016, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties, non-cash impairments of the Company’s PRT decommissioning asset, the impact of the change in U.K. statutory income tax rate, and an increase in the amount of valuation allowances on U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets. 

In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016, which provides income tax relief to Exploration and Production (E&P) companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of the Supplementary Charge from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the enacted legislation in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $238 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2015, U.K. deferred income tax liability.

Apache recorded a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Apache will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its U.S. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance. 

For additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to Note 8—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Capital and Operational Outlook 

Apache currently plans to invest $2.4 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities in 2019, of which 70 to 75 percent will be allocated within the United States. Apache’s planned upstream capital investment excludes a one-third noncontrolling interest of capital investment in Egypt for its share of operations. Apache’s $2.4 billion upstream investment plan represents an approximately 22 percent reduction compared to 2018 levels, as well as a significant reduction from the Company’s previous 2019 investment guidance. The revised capital outlook was in response to the rapid fourth quarter 2018 decline in oil prices and Apache’s decision to lower its U.S. rig count. With this and other activity reductions, Apache believes the current upstream capital spending for the first quarter of 2019 will underpin its efforts to achieve the full-year capital target.

Despite the significant decrease in planned capital spending, production growth will continue as the Company benefits from productivity and efficiency gains in its core areas. Apache projects fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 production growth rates of 6 to 10 percent, adjusted for the noncontrolling interest in Egypt and tax volumes. The Company expects 12 to 16 percent growth for its U.S. regions. Approximately five percent growth is expected to be Permian Basin oil, which is driven by a continued focus in Apache’s core Wildfire, Powell and Azalea development fields. As the result of reduced rig activity in the Alpine High play, the Company’s new 2019 Alpine High production volume outlook is 85 to 90 Mboe per day on average for the year. Apache’s drilling focus will shift away from dry gas drilling to a higher percentage of rich gas development, primarily in the Northern flank of the field. With expected cryogenic processing capacity being brought on-line throughout the second half of 2019, the Company believes significant uplift in cash margins should be realized.

Over the same time period, forecasts show a shallow decline rate for the international regions given planned investment levels. Egypt and the North Sea operations, however, are anticipated to continue generating cash flow in excess of capital investments. The North Sea will maintain a similar activity set to the prior year. Egypt activity will focus on advancing a large-scale seismic shoot and prospect identification program. The region will also be drilling exploration and delineation wells in each of its new concession areas, thereby establishing a foundation for potential growth.

Assuming WTI oil prices in the $50 to $55 per barrel range, Apache anticipates an upstream capital program of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020 and 2021. Management believes this investment level is capable of generating continued production growth, with the U.S. as the primary driver.

Apache also anticipates additional investments in the continued capital development of the assets of Altus of approximately $325 million in 2019, approximately $185 million in 2020, and approximately $200 million in 2021. The investment will primarily be directed toward the construction of additional gathering, compression, processing, and transmission facilities, including three forecasted cryogenic processing plants expected to be in service during 2019 with combined nameplate capacity of approximately 600 MMcf/d. Additional capacity will be added over the next several years to facilitate production increases from Alpine High and potential third-party volumes. Cash from the Altus transaction and future ALTM and/or Altus Midstream LP financing activities are expected to fund future development of the Altus assets.

 39

Additionally, Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries obtained the right, but not the obligation, to exercise options to acquire equity interests in five separate joint venture pipelines (Pipeline Options). The option to enter into a 15 percent ownership stake in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC (GCX) natural gas pipeline was exercised in December 2018 for $91 million. Apache anticipates Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries to exercise the remaining four Pipeline Options in 2019 and early 2020. Assuming each Pipeline Option is exercised, approximately $1.6 billion of total capital spending by Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries is estimated for the exercise of these remaining options and the associated capital requirements expected to be incurred until the associated pipelines are in service. This includes approximately $1.3 billion in 2019 and approximately $340 million in 2020. The following table provides additional information regarding the exercise of the Pipeline Options:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the EPIC Option was exercised on February 1, 2019 and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.

(2)Upon exercise of the Permian Highway Pipeline Option, Altus Midstream LP may acquire an additional 1 percent interest in GCX.

(3)Estimated exercise price represents Altus Midstream LP’s proportionate share of capital expenditures made with respect to the applicable project prior to such exercise, plus financing charges associated with such capital expenditures (exercise price). There are no costs associated with exercising the Options other than the exercise price. However, Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries will be required to fund its pro rata share of capital expenditures after the exercise date.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. We may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.

Apache’s operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact Apache’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. These changes potentially impact Apache’s liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short term.

Apache’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of Apache’s drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically. Changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves.

Apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the Company, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including Apache’s capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table presents the sources and uses of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents for the years presented:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.

Net Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2018 totaled $3.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from 2017. The increase primarily reflects higher commodity prices during 2018 compared to 2017.

For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Altus Transaction and Asset Divestitures

 In November 2018, Apache and KAAC completed a previously announced transaction to create a pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation. Upon close, KAAC changed its name to Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) and contributed approximately $628 million of cash, net of transaction expenses, into its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP. Apache contributed its Alpine High midstream assets into Altus Midstream LP in exchange for an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in ALTM and Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus. Cash from the Altus transaction and future ALTM and/or Altus Midstream LP financing activities are expected to fund future development of the Altus assets.

 41

Also during 2018, 2017, and 2016, Apache recorded proceeds from divestitures totaling $138 million, $1.4 billion, and $134 million, respectively. For information regarding the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures, please see Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Fixed-Rate Debt Borrowings

 In August 2018, Apache closed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.375% notes due October 15, 2028. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes of $992 million were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in September 2018, and for general corporate purposes.

Capital Expenditures and Equity Interest

During 2018, 2017, and 2016, capital spending for exploration and development (E&D) activities totaled $3.2 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. Apache’s E&D capital spending was focused primarily in its North American onshore regions. Apache’s investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) facilities totaled $581 million, $530 million, and $158 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 

GTP expenditures over the past three years are nearly all comprised of investments in midstream infrastructure for the Alpine High play, which were subsequently contributed to Altus Midstream LP upon closing of the Altus transaction.

Apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions for cash totaling $133 million, $178 million, and $181 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Acquisition investments continued to focus on adding new leasehold positions to our North American onshore portfolio.

On December 19, 2018, Altus Midstream LP exercised its option to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC (GCX), a Delaware limited liability company, for total cash consideration of $91 million. GCX is a long-haul natural gas pipeline that is expected to be operational and in-service in the fourth quarter of 2019. Apache will consolidate this joint venture equity interest through ALTM. 

Payments on Fixed-Rate Debt 

In August 2018, the Company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $731 million aggregate principal amount of notes for approximately $828 million, which included principal, the discount to par, and an early tender premium totaling $820 million, as well as accrued and unpaid interest of $8 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $94 million on extinguishment of debt, including $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount, in connection with the note purchases. Apache also made repayments of current year note maturities totaling $550 million during 2018.

Dividends

The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 54 consecutive years through 2018. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. Common stock dividends paid during 2018 totaled $382 million, compared with $380 million in 2017 and $379 million in 2016.

Egypt Noncontrolling Interest

Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas business in Egypt. Apache made cash distributions totaling $345 million, $265 million, and $293 million to Sinopec in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Shares Repurchased

In 2013 and 2014, Apache’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company initiated the buyback program on June 10, 2013, and through December 31, 2018, had repurchased a total of 40 million shares at an average price of $79.18 per share. During 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $38.99 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million additional shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.

Liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash and Cash Equivalents

At December 31, 2018, Apache had $714 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $450 million was held by Altus. The majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Debt

At December 31, 2018, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled $8.2 billion, of which, $150 million matures in 2019, $393 million matures in 2021, $687 million matures in 2022, and the remaining matures in years 2023 through 2096. At December 31, 2018, $150 million of 7.625% senior notes due July 1, 2019 is classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet.

On August 23, 2018, Apache closed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.375% notes due October 15, 2028. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes of $992 million were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in September 2018, and for general corporate purposes.

In August 2017, the Company assumed the obligations of Apache Finance Canada Corporation (AFCC) in respect of $300 million 7.75% notes due in 2029, which AFCC issued and the Company guaranteed pursuant to the governing indenture. The assumption was permitted by the indenture and effected pursuant to a supplemental indenture thereto. As a result of the assumption, the Company is the obligor under the notes and indenture, and AFCC is released from its obligations thereunder. The $300 million 7.75% notes historically have been included in the Company’s long-term debt; accordingly, the assumption did not change the Company’s long-term debt or total debt.

Available Credit Facilities

In March 2018, Apache entered into a revolving credit facility that matures in March 2023 (subject to Apache’s two, one-year extension options) with commitments totaling $4.0 billion. Apache can increase commitments up to $5.0 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. The facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to $3.0 billion, of which $2.08 billion was committed as of December 31, 2018. The facility is for general corporate purposes and committed borrowing capacity fully supports Apache’s commercial paper program. Letters of credit are available for security needs, including in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018, letters of credit aggregating approximately £112.5 million and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. In February 2019, £109.4 million of these outstanding letters of credit no longer were required and were terminated.

At Apache’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2018 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. Apache also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon Apache’s senior long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2018, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent. A commission is payable quarterly to lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR margin then in effect. Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.

The financial covenants of the 2018 credit facility require Apache to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2018, Apache’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 30 percent.

 43

The 2018 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of Apache and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. Apache also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of Apache’s consolidated net tangible assets, or approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In November 2018, Altus Midstream LP, an indirectly controlled subsidiary of Apache, entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in November 2023 (subject to Altus Midstream LP’s two, one-year extension options). The agreement for this facility provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of $450 million until (i) the consolidated net income of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement, for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds $175 million on an annualized basis and (ii) Altus Midstream LP has raised at least $250 million of additional capital (such period, the “Initial Period”). Following the Initial Period, the aggregate commitments equal $800 million. All aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to $100 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $100 million. After the Initial Period, Altus Midstream LP may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under this facility.

The Altus Midstream LP credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by Apache or any of Apache’s other subsidiaries. 

There are no clauses in either the agreement for Apache’s 2018 credit facility or for Altus Midstream LP’s 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. These agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if Apache or Altus Midstream LP, as applicable, undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. Each of Apache and Altus Midstream LP was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of December 31, 2018.

There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to Apache or Altus Midstream LP will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.

Commercial Paper Program

As of December 31, 2018, Apache has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates Apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under Apache’s 2018 $4.0 billion committed credit facility. If Apache is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, Apache’s 2018 committed credit facility, which matures in 2023, is available as a 100 percent backstop. As of December 31, 2018, Apache had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in “Contractual Obligations” in this Item 7. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.

 44

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)This table does not include the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 6 and 10, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(3)Payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells net of amounts billed to partners will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense. 

(4)Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Includes amounts related to firm transportation capacity on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project), expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the Permian Highway Pipeline Project, expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2020 (refer to Delivery Commitments disclosure in Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding fixed sales contracts related to these pipelines). Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.

(5)Amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities.

As further described above under “Capital and Operational Outlook,” Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise options to acquire equity interest in third-party joint venture pipelines. Upon exercising each individual option, Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries may be required to fund future capital expenditures for its equity interest share in the development of the pipeline as referenced. In December 2018, Altus Midstream LP exercised its option for a 15 percent equity interest in the GCX Pipeline and estimates it will incur approximately $175 million of additional capital contributions during 2019 for its associated interest with the remaining construction costs.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $4 million for environmental remediation and approximately $35 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

In addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of our Gulf of Mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

 45

With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While requirements under the NTL have not yet been fully implemented by BOEM, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.

Insurance Program

We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.

Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. Coverage for Gulf of Mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.

Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to Apache’s interest. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) reinsures OPIC. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to Apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.

Apache has an additional insurance policy with OPIC, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC.

Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apache’s most critical accounting policies.

Reserves Estimates

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.

 46

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.

Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.

When estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must apply various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, the Company prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in “Reserve Estimates” of this Item 7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.

Oil and Gas Exploration Costs

Apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.

 47

Under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. We discount the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. 

To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.

Although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.

Over the past several years, the Company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices, which impacted our future development plans and operating cash flows. As such, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities in 2018 and 2016. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.

Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.
