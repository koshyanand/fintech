ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit ratings, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.

Risks Related to our Business

Our operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.

Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons, including the risks discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. Events such as a delay in product development or a revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a particular period to be below our expectations. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to the timing of charges that we may take. We have recorded, or may be required to record, charges that include development milestone and license payments under collaboration and license agreements, amortization of acquired intangibles and other acquisition related charges, and impairment charges. Several other factors, including government rebates, distributor buying patterns and government tender timing, impact the dollar value of product sales recorded in any particular quarter.

Our revenues are also subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operation in the period in which we incur those gains or losses. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts, a combination of foreign currency put and call options, and occasionally purchased put options to manage foreign currency risk, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuation among our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency and other hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from hedge ineffectiveness or from the termination of a hedge arrangement. For more information, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained elsewhere in this report.

We are dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, and VIDAZA®.

Our business is largely dependent on the commercial success of REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, and VIDAZA®. REVLIMID® currently accounts for over half of our total revenue. As new products, such as POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and OTEZLA®, have obtained regulatory approval and gained market acceptance, our dependence on REVLIMID® has decreased, a trend that we expect to continue. A significant decline in REVLIMID® net revenue, in the absence of offsetting increases in revenue from our other marketed products, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The success of these products depends on acceptance by regulators, key opinion leaders, physicians, and patients as effective drugs with certain advantages over other therapies. A number of factors, as discussed in greater detail below, may adversely impact the degree of acceptance of these products, including their efficacy, safety, price and benefits over competing products, as well as the reimbursement policies of third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. 

If unexpected adverse events are reported in connection with the use of any of these products, physician and patient acceptance of the product could deteriorate and the commercial success of such product could be adversely affected. We are required to report to the FDA or similar bodies in other countries events associated with our products relating to death or serious injury. Adverse events could result in additional regulatory controls, such as the imposition of costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling which could limit the indications or patient population for a product or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. THALOMID® is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug during pregnancy could result in significant deformities. REVLIMID® and POMALYST®/IMNOVID® are also considered toxic to the human fetus and their respective labels contain warnings against use which could result in embryo-fetal exposure. While we have restricted distribution systems for THALOMID®, REVLIMID®, and POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, and endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential known adverse events, including pregnancy risks, we cannot ensure that all such warnings and recommendations will be complied with or that adverse events resulting from non-compliance will not occur.

Our future commercial success depends on gaining regulatory approval for products in development, and obtaining approvals for our current products for additional indications.

The testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products require regulatory approvals, including approval from the FDA and similar bodies in other countries. Our future growth would be negatively impacted if we fail to obtain timely, or at all, requisite regulatory approvals in the United States and internationally for products in development and approvals for our existing products for additional indications.

The principal risks to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals are as follows:

•In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials may not lead to regulatory approval;

•Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process if the clinical or other data fails to demonstrate compliance with a regulatory agency’s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;

•Delays in the acceptance, review and approval of products by the FDA may result from government shutdowns due to the failure by Congress to enact regular appropriations;

•Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations or legislation;

•Even if a product is approved, the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated uses or the patient population for which the product may be marketed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and profitability of the product;

•After a product is approved, the FDA or similar bodies in other countries may withdraw or modify an approval in a significant manner or request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product due to a number of reasons, including safety concerns, adverse events and side effects;

17

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental and non-governmental organizations can reduce the use of our approved products;

•Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to continuing and ongoing review by regulatory agencies, and the discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to comply with manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on the manufacture, sale or use of a product or its withdrawal from the market; and

•Changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations or legislation could impose restrictions on the sale or marketing of our approved products.

If we fail to comply with laws or government regulations or policies our business could be adversely affected.

The discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our REMS program), marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive laws and government regulations and policies. In addition, individual states, acting through their attorneys general, are increasingly seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations regarding the promotion and sale of our products, appropriate distribution of our products under our restricted distribution systems, off-label promotion and the promotion of unapproved products, government agencies may bring enforcement actions against us or private litigants may assert claims on behalf of the government against us that could inhibit our commercial capabilities and/or result in significant damage awards and penalties.

Other matters that may be the subject of governmental or regulatory action which could adversely affect our business include laws, regulations and policies governing:

•protection of the environment, privacy, healthcare reimbursement programs, and competition;

•parallel importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries; and

•mandated disclosures of clinical trial or other data, such as the EMA’s policy on publication of clinical data.

Sales of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and reimbursement for our products by governmental and other third-party payers are reduced or terminated.

Sales of our current and future products depend, in large part, on the conditions under which our products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations (HCMOs), or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers. 

The influence of HCMOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through a few large HCMOs as a result of industry consolidation. One objective of HCMOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. HCMOs typically use formularies (lists of approved medicines available to members of a particular HCMO), clinical protocols, volume purchasing, long-term contracts and other methods to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers. Due to their lower cost generally, generic medicines are typically placed in preferred tiers of HCMO formularies. Additionally, many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. Exclusion of our products from a formulary or HCMO-implemented restrictions on the use of our products can significantly impact drug usage in the HCMO patient population, and consequently our revenues.

Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of patients’ healthcare costs. These health care management organizations and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, seeking to implement cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Our products continue to be subject to increasing price and reimbursement pressure due to price controls imposed by governments in many countries; increased difficulty in obtaining and maintaining satisfactory drug reimbursement rates; and the tendency of governments and private health care providers to favor generic pharmaceuticals. In addition, governmental and private third-party payers and purchasers of our products may restrict access to formularies or otherwise discourage use of our products. Limitations on patient access to our drugs, adoption 

18

of price controls and cost-containment measures could adversely affect our business. In addition, our operating results may also be affected by distributors seeking to take advantage of price differences among various markets by buying our products in low cost markets for resale in higher cost markets.

Federal and state legislation may affect our pricing policies and government reimbursement of our products which may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.

In the U.S. there have been and are likely to continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments (e.g., the President's American Patients First Blueprint and related regulatory proposals) related to drug pricing and reimbursement at both the federal and state level that could impact our profitability. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA, were signed into law in March 2010, and are referred to collectively as the Healthcare Reform Acts. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in December 2018, a U.S. district court held that the ACA was unconstitutional, although the ruling is stayed pending the appeals process. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which includes a provision that entered into effect on January 1, 2019, that repeals the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA, and we expect the Trump Administration and Congress may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.

Moreover, changes could be made to governmental healthcare and insurance reimbursement programs that could significantly impact the profitability of our products. Building from the President’s American Patients First Blueprint, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in October 2018, seeking comments on possible changes to certain Medicare Part B reimbursement mechanisms. Notably, one such proposal would introduce international reference pricing for pharmaceuticals in setting reimbursement for those medicines. As these proposals are just at the beginning of the regulatory process, we cannot predict what the final rules (if any) will be, or the impacts on our products.

Additionally, the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, in general and specialty drugs in particular, have received the attention of U.S. policymakers, state legislators and others. In January 2019, as part of an inquiry sent to twelve companies representing many of the most significant Part D drugs, we received a letter from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (“Committee”) inquiring into certain matters relating to the pricing and commercialization practices for REVLIMID®, as well as other information relating to company operations. We are cooperating with the Committee to respond; however, at this time, we cannot predict the impact of this request or the increased policy focus on the pricing or reimbursement of our products or pharmaceutical products generally. Other committees in the House or Senate have held hearings or announced plans to consider a variety of legislative initiatives relating to pricing and access for pharmaceutical products.

The Healthcare Reform Acts, among other things, made significant changes to the Medicaid rebate program by increasing the minimum rebates that manufacturers like us are required to pay. These changes also expanded the government’s 340B drug discount program by expanding the category of entities qualified to participate in the program and benefit from its deeply discounted drug pricing. The Healthcare Reform Acts also obligate the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers the 340B program, to update the agreement that each manufacturer must sign to participate in the 340B program to require each manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug product available to any other purchaser at any price, and to report the ceiling prices for its drugs to the government. HRSA issued this update in late 2016, and we signed an amendment to our agreement on December 29, 2016. 

Furthermore, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to, among other things, allow some states to exclude coverage for some prescription drugs under Medicaid. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures could be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.

HRSA also issued proposed regulations to implement an administrative dispute resolution (ADR) process for certain disputes arising under the 340B program, including (1) claims by covered entities that they have been overcharged for covered outpatient drugs by manufacturers; and (2) claims by manufacturers, after a manufacturer has conducted an audit, that a covered entity has violated the prohibition on diversion of covered outpatient drugs to ineligible patients or duplicate discounts. The exact timing 

19

and content of final action on these matters is uncertain at this time. Depending on their final form, these actions could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways that may have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, in early 2016, HRSA finalized a regulation regarding the 340B pricing methodology and providing guidelines for when civil monetary penalties may be issued for “knowing and intentional” manufacturer overcharges of 340B covered entities. The effective date of this regulation was January 1, 2019. Following the effective date, manufacturers who are found to have knowingly and intentionally overcharged 340B covered entities could be subject to significant monetary penalties. Such findings could also result in negative publicity that could harm the manufacturer’s reputation or cause business disruption.

Over the course of the past few years, we have received inquiries from HRSA regarding our limited distribution networks for REVLIMID®, POMALYST®, and THALOMID® and our compliance with the 340B program. We have cooperated fully in responding to those inquiries and believe that we have complied with applicable legal requirements. 

If we are ultimately required to change our sales or pricing practices with regard to the distribution of these drugs under the 340B program, or if we were required to pay penalties under the applicable regulations, there would be an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. 

Our ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United States depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations.

Many existing and potential customers for our products become members of group purchasing organizations (GPOs). GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO’s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the GPO for the duration of that contractual arrangement. Our failure to enter into or renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could adversely affect our sales.

Our long-term success depends, in part, on intellectual property protection.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. There can be no assurance that if claims of any of our owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third parties (through, for example, litigation or post grant review in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or EPO), a court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will ultimately determine, after all opportunities for appeal have been exhausted, that our patent claims are valid and enforceable. If a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease using such products or processes, be subject to significant liabilities to such third party and/or be required to obtain license rights from such third party. Lawsuits involving patent claims are costly and could affect our results of operations, result in significant expense and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. For more information on challenges to certain of our patents and settlement of certain of these challenges, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

In addition, we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by third-party patent rights, provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or be circumvented, opposed, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or infringed by others.

Our intellectual property rights may be affected by certain provisions of the America Invents Act (AIA) enacted in 2011. For example, under the AIA, members of the public may seek to challenge an issued patent by petitioning the USPTO to institute a post grant proceeding, such as a Post Grant Review (PGR) or Inter Partes Review (IPR). Once a post grant proceeding is instituted, the USPTO may find grounds to revoke the challenged patent or specific claims therein. For more information with respect to IPRs, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report. A similar procedure (known as a patent opposition) has existed in Europe for many years and we have defended our European patents in certain of those proceedings. We cannot predict whether any other Celgene patents will ever become the subject of a post grant proceeding or patent opposition. If a significant product patent is successfully challenged in a post grant proceeding or patent opposition, it may be revoked, which would have a serious negative impact on our ability to maintain exclusivity in the market-place for our commercial products affected by such revocation and could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.

On October 2, 2014, the EMA adopted its clinical transparency policy, "Policy on Publication of Clinical Data for Medicinal Products for Human Use" (Clinical Data Policy), which became effective on January 1, 2015. In general, under the Clinical Data 

20

Policy, clinical data is not deemed to be commercially confidential data. Therefore, there is a risk that unpublished proprietary information, including trade secrets that are incorporated into a marketing application before the EMA may be made publicly available. It is difficult to predict how any public disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential and proprietary information made available under the Clinical Data Policy may adversely impact our patent rights and our competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Also, procedures for obtaining patents and the degree of protection against the use of a patented invention by others vary from country to country. There can be no assurance that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to or recognized by the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country.

The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.

We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. Despite precautions taken by us, there can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection, that they will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our proprietary and trade secret technologies will not otherwise become known to others or found to be non-proprietary.

We receive confidential and proprietary information from collaborators, prospective licensees and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees’ former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims, which can result in significant costs if we are found to have improperly used the confidential or proprietary information of others. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of personnel and resources.

Our products may face competition from lower cost generic or follow-on products.

Manufacturers of generic drugs are seeking to compete with our drugs and present a significant challenge to us. Those manufacturers may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents in court, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation. If any of our owned or licensed patents are infringed or challenged, we may not be successful in enforcing or defending those intellectual property rights and, as a result, may not be able to develop or market the relevant product exclusively, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales of that product. In addition, manufacturers of innovative drugs as well as generic drug manufacturers may be able to design their products around our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. For more information concerning certain pending proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights and settlements of certain challenges, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, or upon the “at-risk” launch by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products, we can quickly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product. In addition, as additional competitors enter the market, our patented products may face increased competition or pricing pressure.

Orphan exclusivity and regulatory data protection for REVLIMID®’s multiple myeloma indication in Europe expired in June 2017. The regulatory marketing protection for REVLIMID® in Europe expired in June 2018. Notwithstanding that our intellectual property rights for REVLIMID® in the major European markets are due to remain in force through at least 2022, we expect that some generic drug companies may attempt to market a generic version of REVLIMID® in such European markets before this time. We have recently been made aware of various generic drug manufacturers receiving regulatory clearance for generic versions of REVLIMID® in some European countries. Although we are confident in the strength of our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for generic drug companies to successfully challenge our rights and launch their generic versions of REVLIMID® into the market prior to the expiration of our intellectual property rights in Europe for REVLIMID®.

21

Certain novel approaches to the treatment of diseases, such as CAR T cell therapy, may present significant challenges and risks for us.

The development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases, such as our acquisition in the first quarter of 2018 of Juno’s CAR T cell immunotherapy and related technologies, presents many new challenges and risks due to the unique nature of genetic modification of patient cells ex vivo using certain viruses to reengineer these cells to ultimately treat diseases, including obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies that have very limited experience with the development of cellular therapies involving genetic modification of patient cells; developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes, while limiting contamination, for engineering a patient’s cells ex vivo and infusing genetically modified cells back into the patient; developing processes for the safe administration of cellular therapies, including long-term follow-up for patients receiving cellular therapies; and sourcing additional clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our potential CAR T products. The use of reengineered cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by the regulatory, patient or medical communities. Further, we may not be able to satisfactorily establish the safety and efficacy or the reliability of these therapies or demonstrate the potential advantages and side effects compared to existing and future cellular therapies. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For instance, in February 2019, CMS issued a proposed coverage decision memo on CAR T cells that would apply to the entire Medicare program that, if finalized as drafted, includes requirements such as patient enrollment in a registry and certain capabilities required of the site to be eligible for Medicare payment for CAR T cell therapy. Furthermore, certain payment models could impact the interest of appropriate treatment sites in administering CAR T cell therapies, thereby limiting patient access. The CMS has opened a national coverage analysis on CAR T cells and may impose coverage limitations on such cellular therapies. These coverage limitations would apply to the entire Medicare program and could include, among other things, a requirement for patients to be enrolled in a registry in order for the provider to be paid for CAR T cell therapy. To date, only a few products that involve the genetic modification of patient cells have been approved for commercial sale. Moreover, the safety profiles of cellular therapies may adversely influence public perception and may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if approved, of physicians and payors to subscribe to these novel treatment approaches. If we fail to overcome these and other challenges, or if significant adverse events are reported from similar therapies, our development of these novel treatment approaches may be hampered or delayed, which could adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to this therapeutic program.

Our business operates in an extremely competitive environment.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including, but not limited to:

•Hematology and Oncology: AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Roche/Genentech, Sanofi and Takeda; and

•Inflammation and Immunology: AbbVie, Amgen, Biogen, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and UCB S.A.

Some of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have, enabling them, among other things, to make greater research and development investments. We also experience competition in drug development from universities and other research institutions, and we compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change, and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made and become more widely known. The development of products or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are developing could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.

A decline in general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations.

Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on third-party payers. As a result of global credit and financial market conditions, these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. For information about receivable balances relating to government-owned or -controlled hospitals in European countries, see Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained elsewhere in this report.

In addition, due to tightened global credit, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business, including portions of our product manufacturing, clinical development of future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials and supply of raw materials. If 

22

such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business could be adversely affected.

We may be required to modify our business practices, pay fines and significant expenses or experience other losses due to governmental investigations or other enforcement activities.

We may become subject to litigation or governmental investigations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions that may arise from the conduct of our business. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities.

While the ultimate outcomes of investigations and legal proceedings are difficult to predict, adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters could result in, among other things:

•significant damage awards, fines, penalties or other payments, and administrative remedies, such as exclusion and/or debarment from government programs, or other rulings that preclude us from operating our business in a certain manner;

•changes and additional costs to our business operations to avoid risks associated with such litigation or investigations;

•product recalls;

•reputational damage and decreased demand for our products; and

•expenditure of significant time and resources that would otherwise be available for operating our business.

For more information relating to governmental investigations and other legal proceedings and recent settlements of legal proceedings, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

The development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we are currently developing.

Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources, extensive research, development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. This process takes many years of effort without any assurance of ultimate success. Our product development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many reasons, including: 

•the failure of the product candidate in preclinical or clinical studies; 

•adverse patient reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns; 

•insufficient clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority of the product candidate; 

•our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner; 

•our failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, the facilities or the process used to manufacture the product candidate;

•changes in the regulatory environment, including pricing and reimbursement, that make development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer attractive; 

•the failure to obtain or maintain satisfactory drug reimbursement rates by governmental or third-party payers; and

•the development of a competitive product or therapy.

If a product were to fail to be approved or if sales fail to materialize for a newly approved product, we may incur losses related to the write-down of inventory, impairment of property, plant and equipment dedicated to the product or expenses related to restructuring.

23

Disruptions of our manufacturing and distribution operations could significantly interrupt our production and distribution capabilities.

We have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our products and we have contracted with third parties to provide other manufacturing, finishing, and packaging services. Any of those manufacturing processes could be partially or completely disrupted by fire, contamination, natural disaster, terrorist attack or governmental action. A disruption could lead to substantial production delays and the need to establish alternative manufacturing sources for the affected products requiring additional regulatory approvals. In the interim, our finished goods inventories may be insufficient to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis. Further, our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur.

In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental regulations define standards for manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distributing and storing pharmaceutical products. Our failure to comply, or the failure of our contract manufacturers and distributors to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.

We have contracted with various distributors to distribute most of our branded products. If our distributors fail to perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time, our revenue could be adversely affected.

We have limited experience manufacturing CAR T cell immunotherapies, and our processes may be more difficult or more expensive than the approaches taken by our current and future competitors. We cannot be sure that the manufacturing processes employed by us will result in CAR T cell immunotherapies that will be safe and effective. Our ability to source supplies for materials used to manufacture our CAR T cell immunotherapies and to develop consistent and reliable manufacturing processes and distribution networks with an attractive cost of goods could impact future anticipated revenue and gross profit for our CAR T cell immunotherapies. In addition, we may face challenges with sourcing supplies for clinical and, if approved commercial manufacturing. Logistical and shipment delays and other factors not in our control could prevent or delay the delivery of our product candidates to patients. Additionally, we are required to maintain a complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material as such material moves through the manufacturing process, and failure to maintain such chain of identity and custody could result in adverse patient outcomes, loss of product or regulatory remedial action, which could adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to this therapeutic program.

The consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions could increase competitive and pricing pressures.

We sell our pharmaceutical products in the United States primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted pharmacies. These wholesale customers comprise a significant part of our distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation. As a result, a smaller number of large wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains control a significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee-for-service arrangements and their purchases may exceed customer demand, resulting in increased returns or reduced wholesaler purchases in later periods.

Risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation.

We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including employment, anti-corruption, environmental, competition and privacy laws. Such improper actions, particularly with respect to foreign healthcare professionals and government officials, could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties, adversely impact our ability to conduct business in certain markets, negatively affect our results of operations and damage our reputation.

We are subject to a variety of risks related to the conduct and expansion of our business internationally, particularly in emerging markets.

As our operations expand globally, we are subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign markets, particularly in emerging markets. Those risks include:

•increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs; 

24

•longer payment and reimbursement cycles;

•difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; 

•local marketing and promotional challenges;

•lack of consistency, and unexpected changes, in foreign regulatory requirements and practices;

•increased risk of governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations;

•increased exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 

•the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards;

•operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices;

•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations;

•import and export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers; 

•weak or no protection of intellectual property rights; 

•possible enactment of laws regarding the management of and access to data and public networks and websites;

•possible future limitations on foreign-owned businesses;

•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and 

•other factors beyond our control, including political, social and economic instability, popular uprisings, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general.

As we continue to expand our business into multiple international markets, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and strategic initiatives.

We may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we acquire, including the acquisitions of Impact Biomedicines, Inc. and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. in the first quarter of 2018, and we may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions. Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquired businesses will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner. Our integration of acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including:

•demands on management related to the increase in our size after an acquisition;

•the diversion of management’s attention from daily operations to the integration of acquired businesses and personnel;

•higher than anticipated integration costs;

•failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;

•difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;

•difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and

•difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls, including internal control over financial reporting, and related procedures and policies.

In addition, we may not be able to realize the projected benefits of corporate strategic initiatives we may pursue in the future.

25

We may not be able to continue to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, manufacturing and commercial talent.

The success of our business depends, in large part, on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical, manufacturing, commercial and other professional personnel, and competition for these types of personnel is intense. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.

Risks associated with using hazardous materials in our business could subject us to significant liability.

We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development, manufacturing and other business activities. If an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for remediation obligations, damages and fines that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage.

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and investigative demands in the ordinary course of our business, the ultimate outcome of which may result in significant expense, payments and penalties.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings that include patent, product liability, consumer, commercial, antitrust and other claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future be subject to adverse judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such judgments are received or settlements occur. For more information regarding settlement of certain legal proceedings, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Our activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the False Claims Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as anti-kickback and false claims laws, and similar laws in international jurisdictions. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities, as well as by consumers, third-party payers, stockholders and others. There can be no assurance that existing or future proceedings will not result in significant expense, civil payments, fines or other adverse consequences. For more information relating to governmental investigations and other legal proceedings and recent settlements of legal proceedings, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Product liability claims could result in significant damage awards or settlements. Such claims can also be accompanied by consumer fraud claims or claims by third-party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of our products. In addition, adverse determinations or settlements of product liability claims may result in suspension or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization or changes to our product labeling, including restrictions on therapeutic indications, inclusion of new contra-indications, warnings or precautions, which would have a material adverse effect on sales of such product. We have historically purchased product liability coverage from third-party carriers for a portion of our potential liability. Such insurance has become increasingly difficult and costly to obtain. In this context and in light of the strength of our balance sheet we now self-insure these risks beginning in 2016. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcome, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm our reputation and can impact the demand for our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover under any existing third-party insurance policy or that such coverage will be adequate to fully cover all risks or damage awards or settlements. Additionally, if we are unable to meet our self-insurance obligations for claims that are more than we estimated or reserved for that require substantial expenditures, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations.

Changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include interpretations of existing tax laws, the 

26

accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. See ‘Liquidity and Capital Resources’ within Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as well as Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our revenue growth, increase our costs and cause our profitability to decline.

We collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results. We utilize foreign currency forward contracts, a combination of foreign currency put and call options, and occasionally purchased put options, all of which are derivative instruments, to manage foreign currency risk. We use these derivative instruments to hedge certain forecasted transactions, manage exchange rate volatility in the translation of foreign earnings and reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. The use of these derivative instruments is intended to mitigate a portion of the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost, but generally would not fully offset any change in operating results as a consequence of fluctuations in foreign currencies. Any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained elsewhere in this report.

We may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting obligations.

As we continue to expand at a rapid pace, the development of new and/or improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority. During this expansion period, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting. Such misstatements may result in litigation and/or negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock.

Impairment charges or write downs in our books and changes in accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

The value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. Also, if any of our strategic equity investments decline in value, we may be required to write down such investments. In addition, new or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results.

The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.

The market for our shares of common stock may fluctuate significantly. The following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:

•results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our marketed products;

•fluctuations in our commercial and operating results;

•announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors;

•market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular;

•changes or anticipated changes in laws and governmental regulations, including changes in tax, healthcare, environmental, competition and patent laws;

•new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;

•public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting;

•patent or proprietary rights developments;

•changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for our products;

27

•the outcome of litigation involving our products, processes or intellectual property;

•the existence and outcome of governmental investigations and proceedings;

•regulatory actions that may impact our products or potential products;

•disruptions in our manufacturing processes or supply chain;

•failure of our collaboration partners to successfully develop potential drug candidates;

•competition; and

•investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product acquisitions.

In addition, a market downturn in general and/or in the biopharmaceutical sector in particular, may adversely affect the market price of our securities, which may not necessarily reflect the actual or perceived value of our Company.

Our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.

We have incurred various forms of indebtedness, including senior notes, commercial paper and a senior unsecured credit facility. Our ability to pay interest and principal amounts when due, comply with debt covenants or repurchase the senior notes if a change of control occurs, will depend upon, among other things, continued commercial success of our products and other factors that affect our future financial and operating performance, including prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond our control.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the debt service requirements under our debt instruments, we may be forced to take remedial actions such as:

•restructuring or refinancing our debt;

•seeking additional debt or equity capital;

•reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, including research and development expenditures; or

•selling assets, businesses, products or other potential revenue streams.

Such measures might not be successful and might not enable us to service our debt obligations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all.

A breakdown or breach of our information technology systems and cyber security efforts could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business.

We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown and unauthorized intrusion. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue. We continuously monitor our data, information technology systems (and those of our third-party providers where appropriate) and our personnel's usage of these systems to reduce these risks and potential threats. However, cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties.

28

The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.

Third parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.

We have certain charter and by-law provisions that may deter a third party from acquiring us and may impede the stockholders’ ability to remove and replace our management or board of directors.

Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Additionally, our by-laws contain provisions intended to strengthen the board’s position in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders’ ability to remove and replace our management and/or board of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer of our common stock.

In addition to the risks relating to our common stock, holders of our CVRs are subject to additional risks.

On October 15, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (Abraxis) and in connection with our acquisition, contingent value rights (Abraxis CVRs) were issued entitling each holder of an Abraxis CVR to a pro rata portion of certain net sales payments if certain specified conditions are satisfied. In addition to the risks relating to our common stock, Abraxis CVR holders are subject to additional risks, including:

•an active public market for the Abraxis CVRs may not continue to exist or the Abraxis CVRs may trade at low volumes, both of which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Abraxis CVRs;

•if the net sales targets specified in the Abraxis CVR Agreement are not achieved within the time periods specified, no payment will be made and the Abraxis CVRs will expire valueless;

•since the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Abraxis CVRs is unclear, any part of an Abraxis CVR payment could be treated as ordinary income and the tax thereon may be required to be paid prior to the receipt of the Abraxis CVR payment;

•any payments in respect of the Abraxis CVRs are subordinated to the right of payment of certain of our other indebtedness;

•we may under certain circumstances redeem the Abraxis CVRs; and

•upon expiration of our obligations under the Abraxis CVR Agreement to continue to commercialize ABRAXANE® or any of the other Abraxis pipeline products, we may discontinue such efforts, which would have an adverse effect on the value of the Abraxis CVRs.

Risks Related to our Proposed Acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb

Our proposed acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.

On January 2, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger agreement”), with Bristol-Myers Squibb and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb (which we refer to as the “merger sub”). Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, merger sub will merge with and into Celgene (the “merger”) and Celgene will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Celgene common stock, other than excluded stock or dissenting stock, will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive (i) $50.00 in cash without interest thereon, (ii) one share of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock, and (iii) one Contingent Value Right (Bristol-Myers Squibb CVR), which will entitle the holder to receive a payment for the achievement of future regulatory milestones. 

29

Completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, a number of which are not within our or Bristol-Myers Squibb’s control, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the merger. These conditions include, among other things: (i) adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, (ii) approval of the stock issuance by the stockholders of Bristol-Myers Squibb, (iii) approval for the listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) of the shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock and Bristol-Myers Squibb CVRs to be issued in the merger, (iv) absence of any injunction or order that prohibits completion of the transaction, (v) accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality qualifications, (vi) performance in all material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the merger and (vii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before the SEC. 

In addition, completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of approvals under the antitrust laws of certain specified foreign jurisdictions. The governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the merger, including other potential transactions in the health care industry or other industries. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the merger. As a condition to authorization of the merger or related transactions, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s business after completion of the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb is not required, and we are not permitted without Bristol-Myers Squibb’s consent, to take any actions or agree to any terms or conditions that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or results of operations of Celgene, Bristol-Myers Squibb and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the completion of the merger.

We can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the merger are not within either our or Bristol-Myers Squibb’s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.

If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the merger agreement or Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders failing to approve the stock issuance, we will remain an independent public company. Our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

•we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of our common stock and other securities, and from our customers, collaborators, suppliers, regulators and employees;

•we may be required to pay Bristol-Myers Squibb a termination fee of $2.2 billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances;

•we will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs incurred in connection with the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, including certain fees and expenses of Bristol-Myers Squibb, subject to a cap of $40 million, in connection with our fee reimbursement obligation; 

•the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Bristol-Myers Squibb, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and

•matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.

30

In addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce our performance obligations under the merger agreement.

If any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results, ratings, stock prices and/or note prices.

If the merger agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Bristol-Myers Squibb.

If the merger agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $2.2 billion and certain expenses to Bristol-Myers Squibb. If the merger agreement is terminated under such circumstances, the termination fee we may be required to pay under the merger agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the merger agreement could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial results, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.

Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, and because of the uncertainty of the fair market value of, and the ultimate realization on, the Bristol-Myers Squibb CVRs, our stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the merger.

Upon completion of the merger, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $50.00 in cash without interest thereon, one share of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock and one Bristol-Myers Squibb CVR. Because the exchange ratio of one share of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock is fixed, the value of the share consideration will depend on the market price of shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock at the time the merger is completed. The market price of shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this report until the date the merger is completed, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. There is also uncertainty regarding the fair market value of the Bristol-Myers Squibb CVRs and whether any payment will ultimately be realized on the Bristol-Myers Squibb CVRs. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in Bristol-Myers Squibb’s and Celgene’s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the merger, and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the merger and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond our control. 

While the merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, customers, collaborators or suppliers.

The definitive merger agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we are subject to a variety of specified restrictions. Unless we obtain Bristol-Myers Squibb’s prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and except (i) as required or expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) as required by applicable law or (iii) as set forth in the confidential disclosure schedule delivered by Celgene to Bristol-Myers Squibb, we may not, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of our common stock outside of our equity incentive plans, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property (subject to certain exceptions, including without limitation, acquisitions up to a specified individual amount and an aggregate limitation), dispose of businesses or assets, enter into material contracts or make certain additional capital expenditures. We may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the merger agreement delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management believes they may be advisable. The pendency of the proposed merger may also divert management’s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations.

Our employees, customers, collaborators and suppliers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the merger. In connection with the pending merger, it is possible that some customers, collaborators, suppliers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the merger. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows and/or our stock price.

31

Lawsuits have been filed against us and Bristol-Myers Squibb and other lawsuits may be filed against us and/or Bristol-Myers Squibb challenging the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the proposed acquisition from being completed.

Between February 4, 2019 and February 20, 2019, six putative class actions and three individual actions were filed against us, our board of directors, and in four cases, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and/or Burgundy Merger Sub, Inc. Three complaints, Bernstein v. Celgene Corporation, et al., 2:19-cv-04804; Lowinger v. Celgene Corporation, et al., 2:19-cv-04752; and Wang v. Celgene Corporation, et al., 2:19-cv-04865, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Three complaints, Gerold v. Celgene Corporation, et al., 1:19-cv-00233-UNA; Sbriglio v. Celgene Corporation, et al., 1:19-cv-00277-UNA; and Grayson v. Celgene Corporation, et al., No. 1:19-cv-00332, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Two complaints, Rogers v. Celgene Corporation, et al., 1:19-cv-01275; and Woods v. Celgene Corporation, et al., No. 1:19-cv-01597, were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. One complaint, Ciavarella v. Alles, No. 2019-0133-AGB, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The federal complaints generally allege that defendants prepared and filed a false or misleading registration statement regarding the proposed merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Specifically, the federal complaints allege that the registration statement misstated or omitted material information regarding the parties’ financial projections and the analyses performed by the parties’ financial advisors. Some of the federal complaints also allege that the registration statement misstated or omitted material information regarding potential conflicts of interest faced by Celgene directors and executives. The federal complaints further allege that our board of directors and/or Bristol-Myers Squibb are liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of Celgene under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The federal complaints seek, among other relief, injunctive relief to prevent consummation of the merger until the alleged disclosure violations are cured, damages in the event the merger is consummated, and an award of attorney’s fees. The Ciavarella complaint alleges that Celgene’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to maximize the value of Celgene and that Bristol-Myers Squibb aided and abetted those breaches. It seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent consummation of the merger, damages in the event the merger is consummated, and an award of attorney’s fees.

In addition, a complaint, Landers, et al. v. Caforio, et al., No. 2019-0125-AGB, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Landers is styled as a putative class action on behalf of Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders and names members of the Bristol-Myers Squibb board of directors as defendants, alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose material information about the merger.

Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the definitive merger agreement, the registration statement and/or the proposed acquisition of us by Bristol-Myers Squibb may be filed in the future.

One of the conditions to completion of the proposed acquisition is the absence of any applicable injunction or other order being in effect that prohibits completion of the proposed acquisition. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction, then such order may prevent the proposed acquisition from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.

We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the merger.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees may have an adverse effect on our business. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to attract or retain employees in the past.

Additional information on these risks

Additional information concerning these risks, uncertainties and assumptions can be found in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 39 of our joint proxy statement/prospectus filed February 22, 2019 with the SEC.
