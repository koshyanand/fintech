Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. All references to years in this MD&A represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted.

Management Overview

Our revenues are primarily derived by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions, clinical content, hardware, devices and services that give health care providers and other stakeholders secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real or near-real time, helping them to improve quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of health care.

Our core strategy is to create organic growth by investing in research and development ("R&D") to create solutions and tech enabled services for the health care industry. This strategy has driven strong growth over the long-term, as reflected in five- and ten-year compound annual revenue growth rates of 13% and 12%, respectively. This growth has also created an important strategic footprint in health care, with Cerner® solutions in more than 27,500 contracted provider facilities worldwide, including hospitals, physician practices, laboratories, ambulatory centers, behavioral health centers, cardiac facilities, radiology clinics, surgery centers, extended care facilities, retail pharmacies, and employer sites. Selling additional solutions and services back into this client base is an important element of our future revenue growth. We are also focused on driving growth by strategically aligning with health care providers that have not yet selected a supplier and by displacing competitors in health care settings that are looking to replace their current suppliers. We may also supplement organic growth with acquisitions or strategic investments.

We expect to drive growth through solutions and tech-enabled services that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate and expand our reach into health care. Examples of these include our CareAware® health care device architecture and devices, Cerner ITWorksSM services, revenue cycle solutions and services, and HealtheIntent® population health solutions and services. Finally, we continue to believe there is significant opportunity for growth outside of the United States, with many non-U.S. markets focused on health care information technology as part of their strategy to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care.

Beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth, we are also focused on earnings growth. Similar to our history of growing revenue, our net earnings have increased at compound annual rates of 10% and 13% over the most recent five- and ten-year periods, respectively. We expect to drive earnings growth as we continue to grow our revenue. We also have opportunities to expand our operating margins over time. In the near term, we expect growth in non-cash expenses, such as amortization and depreciation, and a mix of lower margin revenue associated with some of our rapidly growing services businesses will limit our margin expansion. Longer-term, we expect to generate margin expansion as the growth rate of non-cash expenses slows, we achieve economies of scale and efficiencies in our services businesses, control general and administrative expenses, and get more contributions to our growth from solutions on our HealtheIntent platform, which we expect to be accretive to our overall margins.

We are also focused on continuing to deliver strong levels of cash flow, which we expect to accomplish by continuing to grow earnings and prudently managing capital expenditures.

Results Overview

Bookings, which reflects the value of executed contracts for software, hardware, professional services and managed services, was $6.72 billion in 2018, which is an increase of 6% compared to $6.32 billion in 2017.

Revenues for 2018 increased 4% to $5.37 billion, compared to $5.14 billion in 2017. The increase in revenue reflects ongoing demand from new and existing clients for Cerner's solutions and services driven by their needs to keep up with regulatory requirements, adapt to changing reimbursement models, and deliver safer and more efficient care.

Net earnings for 2018 decreased 27% to $630 million, compared to $867 million in 2017. Diluted earnings per share decreased 26% to $1.89 in 2018, compared to $2.57 in 2017. The overall decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share was 

27
primarily a result of increased operating expenses, which includes the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and a $45 million pre-tax charge to provide an allowance against certain disputed client receivables. Additionally, we had a lower effective tax rate in 2017, stemming from certain U.S. income tax reform enacted in December 2017.

We had cash collections of receivables of $5.49 billion in 2018 compared to $5.44 billion in 2017. Days sales outstanding was 79 days for the 2018 fourth quarter compared to 82 days for the 2018 third quarter and 72 days for the 2017 fourth quarter. Operating cash flows for 2018 were $1.45 billion compared to $1.31 billion in 2017.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance as further discussed in Note (2) of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The impact of applying this new guidance (versus prior U.S. GAAP) increased 2018 revenues and earnings before income taxes by $207 million and $101 million, respectively. This impact is primarily driven by certain new contracts in 2018 where we made commitments for specified upgrades. Under the new revenue guidance, we are required to estimate stand-alone selling price when allocating transaction consideration to performance obligations, such as specified upgrades. Under prior U.S. GAAP, we could not establish vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for specified upgrades, which would have delayed the revenue recognition on the entire contract until the upgrades were delivered.

Health Care Information Technology Market Outlook

We have provided an assessment of the health care information technology market under "Health Care and Health Care IT Industry" in Part I, Item 1 "Business," which is incorporated herein by reference.

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues & Backlog

Revenues increased 4% to $5.37 billion in 2018, as compared to $5.14 billion in 2017. The growth in revenues includes a $220 million increase in professional services revenue, driven by increased contributions from Cerner ITWorks and revenue cycle services. Refer to Note (2) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues disaggregated by our business models.

28
Backlog, which reflects contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized as revenue, was $15.25 billion as of December 29, 2018, of which we expect to recognize approximately 29% as revenue over the next 12 months. In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance as further discussed in Note (2) of the notes to consolidated financial statements. In connection with the adoption of such guidance, we modified our calculation of backlog as previously determined under Regulation S-K to represent the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) to conform to the new revenue recognition guidance. Backlog amounts disclosed prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance have not been adjusted, and are not comparable to, the current period presentation.

We believe that backlog may not necessarily be a comprehensive indicator of future revenue as certain of our arrangements may be canceled (or conversely renewed) at our clients' option, thus contract consideration related to such cancellable periods has been excluded from our calculation of backlog. However, historically our experience has been that such cancellation provisions are rarely exercised. We expect to recognize approximately $525 million of revenue over the next 12 months under currently executed contracts related to such cancellable periods, which is not included in our calculation of backlog.

Costs of Revenue

Costs of revenue as a percent of revenues were 17% in both 2018 and 2017.

Costs of revenue include the cost of reimbursed travel expense, sales commissions, third party consulting services and subscription content and computer hardware, devices and sublicensed software purchased from manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, devices, maintenance, support, and services) carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. Costs of revenue does not include the costs of our client service personnel who are responsible for delivering our service offerings. Such costs are included in sales and client service expense.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased 10% to $3.65 billion in 2018, as compared to $3.33 billion in 2017.

salaries and benefits for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, transaction gains or losses on foreign currency, expense for share-based payments, acquisition costs and related adjustments. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased expense associated with share-based payment awards.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operations by Segment

We have two operating segments: Domestic and Global. The Domestic segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures associated with business activity in the United States. The Global segment primarily includes revenue contributions and expenditures linked to business activity in Aruba, Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, England, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. Refer to Note (17) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our reportable segments.

The following table presents a summary of our operating segment information for the years ended 2018 and 2017:

Other, net

Operating results not attributed to an operating segment include expenses such as software development, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs and related adjustments, share-based compensation expense, and certain amortization and depreciation. These expenses increased 10% from 2017 to 2018. The increase is primarily due to increased software development expenses, including increased amortization of capitalized software costs resulting from releases of new and enhanced solutions over the last four quarters.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016

Revenues

Revenues increased 7% to $5.14 billion in 2017, as compared to $4.80 billion in 2016. The growth in revenues includes a $147 million increase in professional services revenue, driven by growth in implementation and consulting activities. Refer to Note (2) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues disaggregated by our business models.

Costs of Revenue

Costs of revenue as a percent of revenues were 17% in 2017, compared to 16% in 2016. The marginally higher costs of revenue as a percent of revenues was primarily due to higher third-party costs associated with technology resale.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased 7% to $3.33 billion in 2017, as compared to $3.11 billion in 2016.

These expenses decreased 2% from 2016 to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to 2016 containing $36 million of expenses associated with a voluntary separation plan. Refer to Note (1) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding our 2016 voluntary separation plan.

33
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of our revenues, our cash collections from our clients and the amount we invest in software development, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and in recent years, our share repurchase programs.

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits with original maturities of less than 90 days, and short-term investments. At the end of 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $374 million and short-term investments of $401 million, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $371 million and short-term investments of $435 million at the end of 2017.

We maintain a $100 million multi-year revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2020. The facility provides an unsecured revolving line of credit for working capital purposes, along with a letter of credit facility. We have the ability to increase the maximum capacity to $200 million at any time during the facility's term, subject to lender participation. As of the end of 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility; however, we had $30 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced our available borrowing capacity to $70 million. Refer to Note (9) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our credit facility.

We believe that our present cash position, together with cash generated from operations, short-term investments and, if necessary, our available line of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2019.

The following table summarizes our cash flows in 2018, 2017 and 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash from Operating Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash flow from operations increased $146 million in 2018 compared to 2017, due primarily to net refunds of taxes. Cash flow from operations increased $62 million in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to an increase in cash impacting earnings, partially offset by an increase in cash used to fund working capital requirements. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received total client cash collections of $5.49 billion, $5.44 billion and $5.18 billion, respectively. Days sales outstanding was 79 days in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to 82 days for the 2018 third quarter and 72 days for the 2017 fourth quarter. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. We expect these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows.

34
Cash from Investing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of capital spending and short-term investment activities.

Our capital spending in 2018 was driven by capitalized equipment purchases primarily to support growth in our managed services business, investments in a cloud infrastructure to support cloud-based solutions, building and improvement purchases to support our facilities requirements and capitalized spending to support our ongoing software development initiatives. Capital purchases in 2018 were higher than 2017 levels, primarily driven by an increase in spending to support our facilities requirements, including commencement of construction on the next two phases of our Innovations Campus (office space development located in Kansas City, Missouri); along with increased capital purchases to support the growth in our managed services business. Total capital spending is expected to increase more than $75 million in 2019, primarily driven by spending to support our facilities requirements, including the continued construction of our Innovations Campus.

Short-term investment activity historically consists of the investment of cash generated by our business in excess of what is necessary to fund operations. Our 2016 and 2018 activity is impacted by higher levels of excess cash being used to repurchase shares of our common stock, as discussed further below. Additionally, on July 27, 2018 we acquired a minority interest in Essence Group Holdings Corporation for cash consideration of $266 million. Refer to Note (4) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this investment. We expect to continue seeking and completing strategic acquisitions or investments that are complementary to our business.

Cash from Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In March 2018, we repaid our $75 million floating rate Series 2015-C Notes due February 15, 2022. Refer to Note (9) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our outstanding indebtedness.

Cash inflows from stock option exercises are dependent on a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, grant activity under our stock option and equity plans, and overall market volatility. We expect net cash inflows from stock option exercises to continue in 2019 based on the number of exercisable options at the end of 2018 and our current stock price. Refer to Note (14) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock option and equity plans.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of our common stock for total consideration of $644 million, 2.7 million shares of our common stock for total consideration of $173 million, and 13.7 million shares of our common stock for total consideration of $700 million, respectively. At the end of 2018, $283 million remains available for repurchase under our current repurchase program. We may continue to repurchase shares under this program in 2019, which will be dependent on a number of factors, including the price of our common stock. Although we may continue to repurchase shares, there is no assurance that we will repurchase up to the full amount remaining under the program. Refer to Note (14) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our share repurchase program.

35
Subject to declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company plans to initiate a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, with the first payment expected in the third quarter of 2019. Future dividends will be subject to the determination, declaration and discretion of the Board of Directors and compliance with our covenants under our credit facility. The Company anticipates that the cash used for future dividends and share repurchases will come primarily from cash from operations.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow increased $62 million in 2018, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash from operations, partially offset by increased capital purchases. Free cash flow increased $179 million in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash from operations, along with reduced capital purchases.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management along with GAAP results to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities reduced by capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. The table above sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities, which we believe is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow. The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results, and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. We believe free cash flow is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational and economic performance, because free cash flow takes into account certain capital expenditures necessary to operate our business.

36
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The following table represents a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2018, except short-term purchase order commitments arising in the ordinary course of business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) At the end of 2018, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were $19 million.

We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K. The effects of inflation on our business during 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not significant.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note (1) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.

Critical Accounting Policies

We believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving our judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, and income taxes. These accounting policies and our procedures related to these accounting policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this MD&A. In addition, Note (1), Note (2), and Note (12) of the notes to consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of our accounting policies for these areas.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09, as amended, replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. This new guidance requires a significant amount of judgments and estimates in implementing its five-step process to be followed in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and related disclosures. Refer to Note (2) of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding significant judgments involved in our application of ASU 2014-09.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design, which is when we determine that technological feasibility has been established. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release, and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value.

Net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product. Because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates, a significant reduction 

37
in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs. If we missed our estimates of net future revenues by 10%, the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired.

Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. We are amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The five-year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon our forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs. Historically, use of our software programs by our clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more.

We expect that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the HCIT market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

Income Taxes

We make a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income taxes. These assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate as well as current tax regulations. Accruals are established for estimates of tax effects for certain transactions, business structures and future projected profitability of our businesses based on our interpretation of existing facts and circumstances. If these assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances, the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.

We have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure contained herein.
