ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.

EOG realized net income of $3,419 million during 2018 as compared to net income of $2,583 million for 2017. At December 31, 2018, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,928 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 401 MMBoe from December 31, 2017. During 2018, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 330 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 424 billion cubic feet or 71 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2017.

Operations

Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2018.

United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.

During 2018, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 77% of United States production during 2018 and 2017. During 2018, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its successor, Heritage Petroleum Company Limited. In 2018, EOG conducted an ocean bottom nodal seismic survey in the SECC Block and the Pelican Field and continued to process and review the initial data. 

Other International.  In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG entered 2018 with two drilled uncompleted wells and completed both wells. In addition, EOG drilled five natural gas wells and completed one of those wells in 2018 as part of the continuing development of the Bajiaochang Field, which natural gas is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina. 

In the U.K., EOG produced crude oil from its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy development project. EOG completed the sale of all of its interest in EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited during the fourth quarter of 2018. EOG no longer has any presence in the U.K.

EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.

Capital Structure

One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 24% at December 31, 2018 and 28% at December 31, 2017. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. 

On October 1, 2018, EOG repaid upon maturity the $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018. 

During 2018, EOG funded $6.6 billion ($411 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $350 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $438 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $63 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of $227 million from the sale of assets.

Total anticipated 2019 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges. The majority of 2019 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.

Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities.

Results of Operations

The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.

Operating Revenues and Other

During 2018, operating revenues increased $6,067 million, or 54%, to $17,275 million from $11,208 million in 2017. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $4,039 million, or 51%, to $11,946 million in 2018 from $7,907 million in 2017. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2018 were approximately 89% of total wellhead revenues compared to 88% in 2017. During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million compared to net gains of $20 million in 2017. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $1,932 million during 2018, to $5,230 million from $3,298 million in 2017. Net gains on asset dispositions of $175 million in 2018 were primarily as a result of exchanges of producing properties and acreage in Texas and sales of producing properties and acreage in the United Kingdom, Texas and the Rocky Mountain area compared to net losses on asset dispositions of $99 million in 2017.

31

Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina operations. The United Kingdom operations were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Argentina operations were sold in the third quarter of 2016.

(3)Dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable. Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements).

(4)Includes a positive revenue adjustment of $0.44 per Mcf related to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue From Contracts with Customers" (ASU 2014-09) (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, EOG presents natural gas processing fees related to certain processing and marketing agreements as Gathering and Processing Costs, instead of as a deduction to Natural Gas revenues.

(5)Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.

32

2018 compared to 2017. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2018 increased $3,261 million, or 52%, to $9,517 million from $6,256 million in 2017, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($2,088 million) and an increase in production ($1,173 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2018 increased 28% to $65.21 per barrel compared to $50.91 per barrel in 2017. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2018 increased 19% to 400 MBbld as compared to 337 MBbld in 2017. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.

NGL revenues in 2018 increased $398 million, or 55%, to $1,127 million from $729 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production ($229 million) and a higher composite average wellhead NGL price ($169 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGL price increased 18% to $26.60 per barrel in 2018 compared to $22.61 per barrel in 2017. NGL production in 2018 increased 31% to 116 MBbld as compared to 88 MBbld in 2017. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.

Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2018 increased $380 million, or 41%, to $1,302 million from $922 million in 2017, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($282 million) and an increase in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($98 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 28% to $2.92 per Mcf in 2018 compared to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017. This increase in composite wellhead natural gas prices includes a positive revenue adjustment of $0.44 per Mcf related to the adoption of ASU 2014-09. Natural gas deliveries in 2018 increased 11% to 1,219 MMcfd as compared to 1,103 MMcfd in 2017. The increase in production was primarily due to increased production in the United States (158 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Trinidad (47 MMcfd). The increased production in the United States was due primarily to increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and higher volumes in the Marcellus Shale. The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2017.

During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $259 million. During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. 

Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.

Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2018 increased $59 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities.

2017 compared to 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2017 increased $1,939 million, or 45%, to $6,256 million from $4,317 million in 2016, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,124 million) and an increase in production ($815 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2017 increased 22% to $50.91 per barrel compared to $41.76 per barrel in 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2017 increased 19% to 337 MBbld as compared to 283 MBbld in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area.

NGL revenues in 2017 increased $292 million, or 67%, to $729 million from $437 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead NGL price ($257 million) and an increase in production ($35 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGL price increased 55% to $22.61 per barrel in 2017 compared to $14.63 per barrel in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by decreased production in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in this region.

33

Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2017 increased $180 million, or 24%, to $922 million from $742 million in 2016, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($227 million), partially offset by a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($47 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 32% to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017 compared to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016. Natural gas deliveries in 2017 decreased 6% to 1,103 MMcfd as compared to 1,175 MMcfd in 2016. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (45 MMcfd) and Trinidad (27 MMcfd). The decreased production in the United States was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in these regions, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and from the 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and other affiliated entities (collectively, the Yates Entities). The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2016.

During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million.

Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2017 increased $9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher margins on natural gas and NGL marketing activities ($16 million), partially offset by lower margins on sand sales ($9 million).

Operating and Other Expenses

2018 compared to 2017. During 2018, operating expenses of $12,806 million were $2,524 million higher than the $10,282 million incurred during 2017.  The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.

The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2018 compared to 2017 are set forth below. See "Operating Revenues and Other" above for a discussion of production volumes.

Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.

Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 

34

Lease and well expenses of $1,283 million in 2018 increased $238 million from $1,045 million in 2017 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($171 million), higher workover expenditures ($44 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($41 million), all in the United States, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the United Kingdom ($18 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.

Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.

Transportation costs of $747 million in 2018 increased $7 million from $740 million in 2017 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($116 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Barnett Shale ($52 million), the Eagle Ford ($31 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($25 million).

DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. 

DD&A expenses in 2018 increased $26 million to $3,435 million from $3,409 million in 2017. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2018 were $24 million higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($647 million) and the United Kingdom ($21 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($625 million) and a decrease in production in Trinidad ($16 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.

G&A expenses of $427 million in 2018 decreased $7 million from $434 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased professional, legal and other services ($24 million); partially offset by increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations ($15 million) and increased information systems costs ($10 million).

Net interest expense of $245 million in 2018 was $29 million lower than 2017 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($25 million) and the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in October 2018 ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($3 million). 

Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets and beginning January 1, 2018, natural gas processing fees from third parties. EOG pays third parties to process a portion of its natural gas production to extract NGLs. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion related to EOG's adoption of ASU 2014-09.

Gathering and processing costs increased $288 million to $437 million in 2018 compared to $149 million in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 ($204 million) and increased operating costs in the Permian Basin ($32 million), the United Kingdom ($28 million) and the Eagle Ford ($25 million).

Exploration costs of $149 million in 2018 increased $4 million from $145 million in 2017 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million), partially offset by decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad ($5 million).

35

Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.

The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2018 and 2017. 

Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.

Taxes other than income in 2018 increased $227 million to $772 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) in 2017. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($190 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and an increase in ad valorem/property taxes ($33 million), both in the United States.

Other income, net, was $17 million in 2018 compared to other income, net, of $9 million in 2017. The increase of $8 million in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation expense ($12 million) and an increase in interest income ($4 million); partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses ($15 million).

EOG recognized an income tax provision of $822 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017, primarily due to the absence of certain 2017 tax benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and higher pretax income. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit in 2017 of approximately $2.2 billion. The net effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 19% from (291%) in the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the TCJA tax benefits.

36

2017 compared to 2016. During 2017, operating expenses of $10,282 million were $1,406 million higher than the $8,876 million incurred during 2016.  The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.

The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2017 compared to 2016 are set forth below. See "Operating Revenues and Other" above for a discussion of production volumes.

Lease and well expenses of $1,045 million in 2017 increased $118 million from $927 million in 2016 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($71 million) and the United Kingdom ($30 million) and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($21 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.

Transportation costs of $740 million in 2017 decreased $24 million from $764 million in 2016 primarily due to divestitures in the Barnett Shale and Upper Gulf Coast ($85 million) and decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($8 million) and the United Kingdom ($8 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production in the Permian Basin ($47 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($20 million) and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($13 million).

DD&A expenses in 2017 decreased $144 million to $3,409 million from $3,553 million in 2016. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2017 were $141 million lower than in 2016 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($449 million) and Trinidad ($19 million) and a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($16 million) and Trinidad ($11 million), partially offset by an increase in production in the United States ($354 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.

G&A expenses of $434 million in 2017 increased $39 million from $395 million in 2016 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($45 million) and increased professional, legal and other services ($30 million), partially offset by 2016 employee related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements ($42 million).

Net interest expense of $274 million in 2017 was $8 million lower than 2016 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($4 million). 

Gathering and processing costs increased $26 million to $149 million in 2017 compared to $123 million in 2016 due to increased activities in the Permian Basin ($12 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million).

Exploration costs of $145 million in 2017 increased $20 million from $125 million in 2016 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad.

37

The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.

Taxes other than income in 2017 increased $195 million to $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) in 2016. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($171 million) and in ad valorem/property taxes ($18 million), both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States.

Other income, net, was $9 million in 2017 compared to other expense, net, of $51 million in 2016. The increase of $60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 ($49 million) and interest income ($5 million).

EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured, resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion. Due largely to this tax rate reduction, the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to (291)% from 30% in the prior year. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Cash Flow

The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; repayments of debt; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.

2018 compared to 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities of $7,769 million in 2018 increased $3,504 million from $4,265 million in 2017 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($4,039 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($758 million) and a favorable change in the cash paid for income taxes ($113 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($746 million) and an unfavorable change in the net cash paid for the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($266 million).

Net cash used in investing activities of $6,170 million in 2018 increased by $2,183 million from $3,987 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,888 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($211 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($64 million).

Net cash used in financing activities of $839 million in 2018 included cash dividend payments ($438 million), repayments of long-term debt ($350 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2018 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million).

2017 compared to 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,265 million in 2017 increased $1,906 million from $2,359 million in 2016 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,411 million) and a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($30 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($362 million), an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($228 million), an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($23 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($10 million).

Net cash used in investing activities of $3,987 million in 2017 increased by $2,734 million from $1,253 million in 2016 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,461 million); a decrease in proceeds from asset sales ($892 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($246 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($80 million).

Net cash used in financing activities of $1,036 million in 2017 included repayments of long-term debt ($600 million), cash dividend payments ($387 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million). 

Total Expenditures

The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Leasehold acquisitions included $291 million and $256 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $3,115 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.

(2)Property acquisitions included $71 million and $26 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $735 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.

(3)Other property, plant and equipment included $49 million of non-cash additions in 2018 primarily related to a capital lease transaction in the Permian Basin and $17 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.

Exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million for 2018 were $1,966 million higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($1,932 million) and Other International ($11 million), increased leasehold acquisitions ($61 million), increased property acquisitions ($51 million) and increased facility expenditures ($50 million), partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in Trinidad ($140 million). The 2018 exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million included $5,546 million in development drilling and facilities, $656 million in exploration, $124 million in property acquisitions and $24 million in capitalized interest. The 2017 exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million included $3,661 million in development drilling and facilities, $623 million in exploration, $73 million in property acquisitions and $27 million in capitalized interest. The 2016 exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million included $3,351 million in exploration, $2,334 million in development drilling and facilities, $749 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. 

39

The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.

Derivative Transactions

Commodity Derivative Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Midland, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Midland Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Midland Differential basis swap contracts through February 19, 2019. The weighted average price differential expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) represents the amount of reduction to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) covered by the basis swap contracts.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EOG has also entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Cushing, Oklahoma (Gulf Coast Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Gulf Coast Differential basis swap contracts through February 19, 2019. The weighted average price differential expressed in $/Bbl represents the amount of addition to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in Bbld covered by the basis swap contracts.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

40

On November 20, 2018, EOG entered into crude oil price swap contracts for the period December 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, with notional volumes of 134,000 Bbld at an average price of $53.75 per Bbl. These contracts offset the crude oil price swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of 134,000 Bbld at an average price of $60.04 per Bbl. The net cash EOG received for settling these contracts was $26.1 million. The offsetting contracts are excluded from the above table.

Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas price swap contracts through February 19, 2019, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EOG has sold call options which establish a ceiling price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the call option contracts. The call options require that EOG pay the difference between the call option strike price and either the average or last business day NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price for the contract month (Henry Hub Index Price) in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is above the call option strike price. 

In addition, EOG has purchased put options which establish a floor price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the put option contracts. The put options grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the put option strike price and the Henry Hub Index Price in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is below the put option strike price. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas call and put option contracts through February 19, 2019, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtud and prices expressed in $/MMBtu.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financing

EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 24% at December 31, 2018, compared to 28% at December 31, 2017. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, EOG had outstanding $6,040 million and $6,390 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,027 million and $6,602 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.

During 2018, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2018 was $208 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2018. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $8 million during the year 2018. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.

41

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, (in thousands): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). These amounts are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.

(2)This table does not include the liability for commitments to purchase fixed quantities of crude oil and natural gas. The amounts are excluded because they are variable and based on future commodity prices. At December 31, 2018, EOG is committed to purchase 3.6 MMBbls of crude oil and 15 Bcf of natural gas in 2019.

(3)Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2018. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.

(4)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

During 2018, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, China and Canada and, through November 2018, the U.K. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2018 was the British pound. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Outlook 

Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2019 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 19, 2019, the average 2019 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $57.15 per barrel and $2.89 per MMBtu, respectively, representing a decrease of 12% for crude oil and a decrease of 6% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2018. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.

Based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity (exclusive of basis swaps) in 2019 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $133 million for net income and $173 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. Based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2019 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $29 million for net income and $37 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 19, 2019, see "Derivative Transactions" above.

Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs.

The total anticipated 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.

Operations.  In 2019, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2018 levels. In 2019, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies

EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and "Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."

Oil and Gas Exploration Costs

EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties

The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.

Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.

Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.

44

Impairments

Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.

When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. 

Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2018, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $107.95 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment. Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.

Stock-Based Compensation

In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility in the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production, capital expenditures, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," “aims,” "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate returns, replace or increase drilling locations, reduce or otherwise control operating costs and capital expenditures, generate cash flows, pay down or refinance indebtedness or pay and/or increase dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration or extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
