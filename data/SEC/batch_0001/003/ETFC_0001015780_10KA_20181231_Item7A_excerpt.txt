ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The following discussion about market risk includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Risk Factors in this report.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk is related primarily to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Managing interest rate risk is essential to profitability. The primary objective of the management of interest rate risk is to control exposure to interest rates within the Board-approved limits and with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our general strategies to manage interest rate risk include balancing variable-rate and fixed-rate assets and liabilities and utilizing derivatives to help manage exposures to changes in interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk requires management to make complex assumptions regarding maturities, market interest rates and customer behavior. Changes in interest rates, including the following, could impact interest income and expense:

•Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may re-price at different times or by different amounts, creating a mismatch.

•The yield curve may steepen, flatten or otherwise change shape, which could affect the spread between short- and long-term rates. Widening or narrowing spreads could impact net interest income.

•Market interest rates may influence prepayments, resulting in maturity mismatches. In addition, prepayments could impact yields as premiums and discounts amortize.

Exposure to interest rate risk is dependent upon the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives. The differing risk characteristics of each product are managed to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2018, 93% of our total assets were interest-earning assets and we had no securities classified as trading.

At December 31, 2018, 65% of total assets were available-for-sale and held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities and residential real estate loans. The values of these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The inverse is true in a falling rate environment.

When real estate loans or mortgage-backed securities are prepaid, unamortized premiums and/or discounts are recognized immediately in interest income. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, these adjustments to income would impact anticipated yields. The Company reviews estimates of the impact of changing market rates on prepayments. This information is incorporated into our interest rate risk management strategy.

Our liability structure consists of two central sources of funding: deposits and customer payables, both of which re-price at management’s discretion. We may utilize securities lending and wholesale funding sources as needed for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements.

Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. See Note 8—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information about our use of derivative contracts.

Scenario Analysis

Scenario analysis is an advanced approach to estimating interest rate risk exposure. The Company monitors interest rate risk using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) approach and the Earnings-at-Risk (EAR) approach.

Under the EVE approach, the present value of expected cash flows of all existing interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, derivatives and forward commitments are estimated and combined to produce an EVE figure. The change in EVE is a long-term sensitivity measure of interest rate risk. The approach values only the current balance sheet in which the most significant assumptions are the prepayment rates of the loan portfolio and mortgage-backed securities and the repricing of deposits. This approach does not incorporate assumptions related to business growth, or liquidation and re-investment of instruments. This approach provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels because changes in EVE indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows. The sensitivity of this value to changes in interest rates is then determined by applying alternative interest rate scenarios. The change in EVE amounts fluctuate based on instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates primarily due to the change in timing of cash flows, which considers prepayment estimates, in the Company’s residential loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios.

EAR is a short-term sensitivity measure of interest rate risk and illustrates the impact of alternative interest rate scenarios on net interest income, including corporate interest expense, over a twelve month time frame. In measuring the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates, we assume instantaneous parallel interest rate shocks applied to the forward curve. In addition, we assume that cash flows from loan payoffs are reinvested in mortgage-backed securities, we exclude revenue from off-balance sheet customer cash and we assume no balance sheet growth.

The following table presents the sensitivity of EVE and EAR at the consolidated E*TRADE Financial level (dollars in millions):

(1)These scenario analyses assume a balance sheet size as of the dates indicated. Any changes in size would cause the amounts to vary.

We actively manage interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets, liabilities and derivatives to optimize our position. For example, a 100 basis points increase in

rates may not result in a change in value as indicated above. We compare the instantaneous parallel interest rate changes in EVE and EAR to the established limits set by the Board of Directors in order to assess interest rate risk. In the event that the percentage change in EVE or EAR exceeds the Board limits, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer must all be promptly notified in writing and decide upon a plan of remediation. In addition, the Board of Directors must be notified of the exception and the planned resolution. At December 31, 2018, the EVE and EAR percentage changes were within our Board limits.

Market Risk

Equity Securities Risk

We are indirectly exposed to equity securities risk in connection with securities collateralizing margin receivables and amounts borrowed under our E*TRADE Line of Credit product, as well as risk related to our securities lending and borrowing activities. We manage risk on margin and line of credit lending by requiring customers to maintain collateral in compliance with internal and, as applicable, regulatory guidelines. We monitor required margin levels daily and require our customers to deposit additional collateral, or to reduce positions, when necessary. We continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration, large orders or positions, and other activities that indicate increased risk to us. We manage risks associated with our securities lending and borrowing activities by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, by monitoring the market value of securities loaned and collateral values for securities borrowed on a daily basis and requiring additional cash as collateral for securities loaned or return of collateral for securities borrowed when necessary, and by participating in a risk-sharing program offered through the Options Clearing Corporation.

Non-Agency Debt Securities Risk

We have recently expanded our enterprise RAS and updated our investment policies to permit investments in high-credit quality non-agency securities that include asset-backed securities. While these investments would represent senior classes in the securitization exposures, we may be exposed to a higher level of credit risk in the future as we purchase such investments.
