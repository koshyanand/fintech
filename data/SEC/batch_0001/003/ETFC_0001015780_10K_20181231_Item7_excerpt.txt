ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

OVERVIEW

E*TRADE is a financial services company that provides brokerage and related products and services for traders, investors, stock plan administrators and participants, and RIAs. For additional information related to our business activities see Part 1. Item 1. Business.

Financial Performance

Our net revenue is generated primarily from net interest income, commissions and fees and service charges:

•Net interest income is largely impacted by the size of our balance sheet, our balance sheet mix, and average yields on our assets and liabilities. Net interest income is driven primarily from interest earned on investment securities, margin receivables, and our legacy loan portfolio, less interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, customer payables, corporate debt and other borrowings.

•Commissions revenue is generated by customer trades and is largely impacted by trade volume, trade type, and commission rates.

•Fees and service charges revenue is primarily impacted by order flow revenue, fees earned on off-balance sheet customer cash and other assets, advisor management and custody fees, and mutual fund service fees.

Our net revenue is offset by non-interest expenses, the largest of which are compensation and benefits and advertising and market development.

Significant Events

Declared first ever quarterly dividend on common stock

In October 2018, our Board of Directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on November 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 30, 2018. On January 23, 2019 the Company declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of $0.14 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 1, 2019.

Completed prior $1 billion share repurchase program and approved new $1 billion program

During 2018, we completed repurchases under the prior $1 billion share repurchase program and our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. We utilized $1.1 billion to repurchase 21.3 million shares at an average price of $53.49 during the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, $499 million remained available for additional purchase.

The following table presents significant components of the consolidated statement of income (dollars in millions except per share amounts):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net income increased 71% to $1.1 billion, or $3.88 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 11% to $614 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Net income available to common shareholders was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflects payments of $36 million in preferred stock dividends, compared to $589 million in 2017 which reflects payments of $25 million in preferred stock dividends. No preferred stock dividends were paid during the year ended December 31, 2016.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The increase in net income from 2016 to 2017 was primarily driven by higher interest income due to a larger balance sheet, an improvement in net interest margin, as well as higher fees and service charges revenue. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $168 million benefit for loan losses, which was partially offset by $27 million of pre-tax costs primarily incurred in connection with the OptionsHouse integration and preparation for the incremental regulatory and reporting requirements that our balance sheet growth required, and a $58 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt. The year ended December 31, 2017 also included a $58 million income tax expense related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets due to tax reform and the new statutory federal income tax rate.

(1)Calculated by dividing net income by average total shareholders’ equity. As described in the Earnings Overview section below, the Company's return on common equity corporate metric is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity, which excludes preferred stock.

(2)Calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by basic earnings per share.

Average interest-earning assets increased 13% to $60.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The fluctuation in interest-earning assets is generally driven by changes in interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and customer payables. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 12% to $56.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was driven by higher sweep deposits during 2018 and deposits assumed as part of the acquisition of TCA and retail brokerage accounts from Capital One, partially offset by customer net buying of $13.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net buying of $9.2 billion during the same period in 2017.

Net interest margin increased 29 basis points to 3.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Net interest margin is driven by the mix of average asset and liability balances and the interest rates earned or paid on those balances. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017 is due to higher interest rates earned on higher margin receivables and investment securities balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of our higher yielding legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio. Additionally, funding costs increased primarily due to increased rates paid on deposits, customer payables, and broker-related payables during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Average interest-earning assets increased 23% to $53.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 23% to $50.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher deposits as a result of transferring customer cash held by third parties to our balance sheet.

Commissions

Commissions revenue increased 13% to $498 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and decreased by less than 1% to $441 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The primary factors that affect commissions revenue are DARTs, average commission per trade and the number of trading days.

DARTs volume increased 32% to 282,243 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 31% to 214,284 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly driven by market sentiment along with the higher volatility of the equity markets. Derivative DARTs volume increased 39% to 90,811 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 54% to 65,264 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016.

Average commission per trade decreased 14% to $7.07 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and decreased 23% to $8.23 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Average commission per trade is impacted by trade mix and differing commission rates on various trade types (e.g. equities, derivatives, stock plan and mutual funds). Average commission per trade for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was also impacted by reduced commission rates implemented in March 2017 as well as the continued migration of customers to lower active trader commission pricing.

Fees and Service Charges

The following table presents the significant components of fees and service charges (dollars in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes revenue earned on average customer cash held by third parties based on the federal funds rate or LIBOR plus a negotiated spread or other contractual arrangements with the third party institutions.

Fees and service charges increased 17% to $431 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 38% to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by increased order flow revenue due to higher trade volume as well as increased advisor management and custody fees as a result of the acquisition of TCA and higher balances in our Managed Portfolios. The increase in 2018 was partially offset by decreased money market funds and sweep deposits revenue driven by lower customer cash balances held by third parties as a result of transferring cash onto our balance sheet during 2018. The impact of the lower balances was partially offset by a higher yield of approximately 140 basis points, 90 basis points and 40 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Gains on Securities and Other, Net

Provision (Benefit) for Loan Losses

We recognized a benefit for loan losses of $86 million, $168 million and $149 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The timing and magnitude of the provision (benefit) for loan losses is affected by many factors that could result in variability. These benefits reflected better than expected performance of our portfolio as well as recoveries in excess of prior expectations, including sales of charged-off loans and recoveries of previous charge-offs that were not included in our loss estimates. For additional information on management's estimate of the allowance for loan losses, see Note 7—Loans Receivable, Net.

Non-Interest Expense

The following table presents the significant components of non-interest expense (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expense increased 14% to $621 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 9% to $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The expense increase in 2018 was primarily driven by a 12% increase in headcount as a result of the TCA acquisition and to support the onboarding of the retail brokerage accounts from Capital One, as well as other growth in our business. The expense increase in 2017 was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation reflecting improved overall Company performance.

Advertising and Market Development

Advertising and market development expense increased 20% to $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 27% to $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These planned increases were primarily due to higher media and brand production spend resulting from our increased focus on accelerating the growth of our business by increasing engagement across new and existing customers.

Amortization of Other Intangibles

Amortization of other intangibles expense increased 33% to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 57% to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase during 2018 was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisition of retail brokerage accounts from Capital One and the TCA acquisition. The increase during 2017 was due to the addition of other intangible assets recognized in connection with the OptionsHouse acquisition. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring for additional information.

Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Activities

Restructuring and acquisition-related activities decreased 53% to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, and decreased 57% to $15 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. Restructuring and acquisition-related expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily includes costs incurred in connection with the restructuring of our regulatory and enterprise risk management functions due to bank regulatory reform and the closing of the TCA acquisition. The restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to the integration of OptionsHouse.

Losses on Early Extinguishment of Debt

Losses on early extinguishment of debt were $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

•During the third quarter of 2018, we used the net proceeds from the June 2018 issuance of Senior Notes to redeem all $413 million of our outstanding TRUPs. In connection with the redemption, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4 million. 

•During the third quarter of 2017, we issued $600 million of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2022 and $400 million of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds, along with existing corporate cash, to redeem our outstanding $540 million of 5.375% Senior Notes and $460 million of 4.625% Senior Notes, which resulted in a $58 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.

Operating Margin

Operating margin was 49% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 45% and 43% for the same period in 2017 and 2016. Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure, was 47% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 40% and 35% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

•The effective tax rate of 26% for the year ended December 31, 2018 included the new statutory federal income tax rate of 21% which was effective January 1, 2018 as well as a slight benefit related to the remeasurement of certain net state deferred tax assets and the accounting for employee share-based compensation.

•The effective tax rate of 42% for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that was enacted on December 22, 2017. This resulted in a reduction in the value of our net federal deferred tax assets using the new statutory federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. As a result, we recognized $58 million of additional tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate also includes the impact of adopting amended accounting guidance for employee share-based compensation. 

•The effective tax rate of 34% for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by a $25 million tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances against certain state deferred tax assets.

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW

The following table presents the significant components of the consolidated balance sheet (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes balance sheet line items property and equipment, net and other assets. Other assets includes certain deferred tax assets due to a presentation change beginning January 1, 2018. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

Cash and Equivalents

Cash and equivalents increased 151% to $2.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash and equivalents will fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including, among other drivers, liquidity needs at the parent, customer activity at our regulated subsidiaries, and the timing of investments at E*TRADE Bank. For additional information on our use of cash and equivalents, see MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources and the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Table of Contents 

Segregated Cash

Cash segregated under federal or other regulations increased 16% to $1.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. The level of segregated cash is driven largely by customer payables and securities lending balances we hold as liabilities compared with the amount of margin receivables and securities borrowed balances we hold as assets. The excess represents customer cash that we are required by our regulators to segregate for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $400 million and $800 million, respectively, of reverse repurchase agreements between E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Bank, representing investments that were also segregated under federal or other regulations by E*TRADE Securities, were eliminated in consolidation.

Investment Securities

The following table presents the significant components of investment securities (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Consists of investments in a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) related mutual fund. At December 31, 2018, these equity securities are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of the adoption of amended accounting guidance related to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

Securities represented 69% and 70% of total assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We classify debt securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity based on our investment strategy and management’s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the debt securities until maturity. 

During the year ended December 31, 2018 securities with a carrying value of $4.7 billion and related unrealized pre-tax gain of $7 million were transferred from held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale securities as part of a one-time transition election for early adopting the new derivatives and hedge accounting guidance. In addition, securities with a fair value of $1.2 billion were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity pursuant to an evaluation of our investment strategy and an assessment by management about our intent and ability to hold those particular securities until maturity.

See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6—Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Securities and Note 16—Shareholders' Equity for additional information.

Margin Receivables 

Margin receivables increased 5% to $9.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. Market valuation of customer assets and market sentiment are economic factors that impact the margin receivables balance. The margin receivables balance as of December 31, 2018 was 8% lower than the $10.4 billion average margin receivables balance for the year ended 2018. The ending margin receivables balance also included the impact of the acquisition of retail brokerage accounts from Capital One in November 2018, which included $127 million of margin receivables. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring for additional information.

Loans Receivable, Net

The following table presents the significant components of loans receivable, net (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Percentage not meaningful.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loans receivable, net decreased 21% to $2.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect the remaining legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio to continue its run-off for the foreseeable future. As our portfolio has seasoned and substantially all interest-only loans have converted to amortizing, we continue to assess underlying performance, the economic environment, and the value of the portfolio in the marketplace. While it is our intention to continue to hold these loans, if the markets improve or our assessment changes, our strategy could change. For additional information on management's estimate of the allowance for loan losses, see Note 7—Loans Receivable, Net.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Securities borrowed decreased 81% to $140 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by a lower demand for securities to cover customer short positions during the period.

Securities loaned decreased 35% to $887 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by lower funding requirements at E*TRADE Securities and lower demand for securities from our counterparties. For additional information on E*TRADE Securities liquidity, see MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net

Goodwill and other intangibles, net increased 12% to $3.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by the addition of goodwill and other intangibles in connection with the acquisition of TCA and retail brokerage accounts from Capital One. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring for additional information.

Deposits

The following table presents the significant components of deposits (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Deposits represented 78% and 76% of total liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in deposits during 2018 was driven by higher sweep deposits, the launch of our premium savings product, and deposits assumed as part of the acquisition of TCA and retail brokerage accounts from Capital One. The increase was partially offset by significant customer net buying of $13.6 billion during 2018. Refer

Brokerage Related Cash

The majority of the deposits balance, specifically sweep deposits, is included in brokerage related cash, which is reported as a customer activity metric. The following table presents the significant components of total brokerage related cash (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)Customer cash held by third parties is maintained at unaffiliated financial institutions. Customer cash held by third parties is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and is not immediately available for liquidity purposes.

We offer the following sweep deposit account programs to our brokerage customers:

•Extended insurance sweep deposit account (ESDA) program

•Retirement sweep deposit account (RSDA) program for retirement plan customers launched in the second quarter of 2018

•Cash balance program offered by E*TRADE Savings Bank for uninvested cash held in eligible custodial accounts as part of the Advisor Services offering launched in connection with the TCA acquisition

The programs utilize our bank subsidiaries, in combination with additional third party program banks, as applicable, to allow customers the ability to have aggregate deposits they hold in the programs insured up to $1,250,000 for each category of legal ownership depending on the program. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 99% of sweep deposits were in these programs. Sweep deposits on balance sheet are held at bank subsidiaries and are included in the deposits line item on our consolidated balance sheet.

Other Borrowings

Other borrowings are summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We had no other borrowings at December 31, 2018 as compared to $910 million of other borrowings at December 31, 2017. The decrease in other borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2018 was due 

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 50

Table of Contents 

primarily to the redemption of our TRUPs during the third quarter, and a decrease in the need for additional short-term borrowings to cover liquidity needs as a result of the on-boarding of deposits associated with the acquisition of retail brokerage accounts from Capital One and customer net selling at the end of the fourth quarter. See MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information on liquidity and funding sources and Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring and Note 13—Other Borrowings for additional information about transactional activity.

Corporate Debt

Corporate debt increased 42% to $1.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018, as we issued Senior Notes in June 2018 and used the net proceeds from the issuance to redeem our TRUPs. See Note 14—Corporate Debt and Note 21—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We have established liquidity and capital policies to support the successful execution of our business strategy, while maintaining ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and especially important for E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities. The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our corporate, banking and broker-dealer liquidity needs under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets.

Liquidity

Our liquidity needs are primarily driven by capital needs at E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities, interest due on our corporate debt, dividend payments on our preferred stock as well as planned capital returns to holders of our common stock. Our banking and brokerage subsidiaries' liquidity needs are driven primarily by the level and volatility of our customer activity. Management maintains a set of liquidity sources and monitors certain business trends and market metrics closely in an effort to ensure we have sufficient liquidity. Potential loans by E*TRADE Bank to the parent company or the parent company's other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization, capital and other requirements. 

Parent Company Liquidity

The parent company's primary source of liquidity is corporate cash. Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents; see the consolidated statement of cash flows for information on cash and equivalents activity. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company and subsidiaries, excluding bank, broker-dealer, and FCM subsidiaries that require regulatory approval or notification prior to the payment of certain dividends to the parent company. Corporate cash includes the parent company's deposits placed with E*TRADE Bank. E*TRADE Bank may use these deposits for investment purposes; however, these investments are not included in consolidated cash and equivalents.

We believe corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Corporate cash is monitored as part of our liquidity risk management. Our current corporate cash minimum target is $300 million and covers approximately 18 months of parent company fixed costs, which includes preferred stock dividends, debt service and other overhead costs. The Company maintains $300 million of additional liquidity through an unsecured committed revolving credit facility. The parent has the ability to borrow against the credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility. Dividends from our operating subsidiaries, including E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities, are additional sources of corporate cash. Subject to regulatory approval or notification, capital generated by these subsidiaries could be distributed to the parent company to the extent 

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 51

Table of Contents 

the excess capital levels exceed both regulatory capital requirements and internal capital thresholds. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries maintained excess regulatory capital over internal thresholds and paid dividends of $1.1 billion to the parent company during 2018.

Corporate cash can fluctuate in any given quarter and is impacted primarily by the following:

•Dividends from and investments in subsidiaries

•Corporate debt activity, including issuances, paydowns and debt service costs

•Reimbursements from subsidiaries for the use of the parent company's deferred tax assets

•Share repurchases

•Acquisitions and other investments

•Parent company overhead less reimbursements through cost sharing arrangements with subsidiaries

•Common stock dividends

•Non-cumulative preferred stock dividends

The following table presents a reconciliation of consolidated cash and equivalents to corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Corporate cash includes the parent company's deposits placed with E*TRADE Bank. E*TRADE Bank may use these deposits for investment purposes; however, these investments are not included in consolidated cash and equivalents.

Corporate cash decreased $150 million to $391 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the following:

•$610 million and $495 million of net dividends received from E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Bank, respectively

•$375 million received from corporate debt activity which includes $417 million in net debt issuance proceeds partially offset by $42 million in debt service costs

•$1.1 billion used for share repurchases

•$429 million used for investments in subsidiaries which includes $413 million to redeem the TRUPs 

E*TRADE Bank Liquidity

E*TRADE Bank, including its subsidiary E*TRADE Savings Bank, relies on bank cash and deposits for liquidity needs. Management believes that within deposits, sweep deposits are of particular importance as they are a stable source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank. The vast majority of E*TRADE Bank's liquidity is invested in securities backed by the US government or its agencies, representing highly liquid securities with low credit risk.

We may also utilize wholesale funding sources for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. In addition, we can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements, although it is not viewed as a primary source of funding. At December 31, 2018, E*TRADE Bank had $6.5 billion and $1.0 billion in collateralized borrowing capacity with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, respectively.

E*TRADE Securities Liquidity

E*TRADE Securities relies on customer payables, securities lending, and internal and external lines of credit to provide liquidity and to fund margin lending. At December 31, 2018, E*TRADE Securities' external liquidity lines totaled approximately $1.3 billion and included the following:

•A 364-day, $600 million senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, with a maturity date in June 2019

•Secured committed lines of credit with two unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $175 million, with maturity dates in June 2019[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 53

Table of Contents 

•Secured uncommitted lines of credit with several unaffiliated banks, aggregating to $375 million with no maturity date

The revolving credit facility contains certain covenants, including maintenance covenants related to E*TRADE Securities' minimum consolidated tangible net worth and regulatory net capital ratio with which the Company was in compliance at December 31, 2018. There were no outstanding balances for any of these lines at December 31, 2018. E*TRADE Securities also maintains lines of credit with the parent company and E*TRADE Bank.

Capital Resources

The Company seeks to manage capital levels in support of our business strategy of generating and effectively deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders, governed by the Company's risk management framework. For additional information on our bank and brokerage capital requirements, refer to Note 19—Regulatory Requirements.

Bank Capital Requirements

At December 31, 2018, our regulatory capital ratios for E*TRADE Financial were above the minimum ratios required to be "well capitalized." E*TRADE Financial's current internal Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold is 6.5%. For additional information on bank regulatory requirements and phase-in periods, refer to Part I. Item 1.

The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.

Broker-Dealer and FCM Capital Requirements

Our broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements determined by their respective regulators. At December 31, 2018, these subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements. We continue to assess our ability to distribute excess net capital to the parent while maintaining adequate capital at the broker-dealer and FCM subsidiaries. For additional information on our broker-dealer and FCM capital requirements, refer to Note 19—Regulatory Requirements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on these arrangements, refer to Note 21—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)Includes annual interest payments.

(2)Includes future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases, including a sale-leaseback that is accounted for as a financing, with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year, net of sublease proceeds.

(3)Includes material purchase obligations for goods and services covered by non-cancelable contracts and obligations through the contractual termination date for cancelable contracts. Includes contracts through the termination date, even if the contract is renewable.

(4)Includes annual interest based on the contractual features of each security, using market rates at December 31, 2018. Interest rates are assumed to remain at current levels over the life of all adjustable rate instruments.

(5)Does not include sweep deposits, savings deposits, money market or checking deposits as there are no stated maturity dates and/or scheduled contractual payments.

The Company also had $67 million in unfunded contingent investment commitments to partnerships, companies and other similar entities, including tax credit partnerships and community development entities, which are not required to be consolidated, at December 31, 2018. Additional information related to commitments and contingent liabilities is detailed in Note 21—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The identification, mitigation and management of existing and potential risks is critical to effective enterprise risk management. There are certain risks inherent to our industry (e.g. execution of transactions) and certain risks that will surface through the conduct of our business operations. We seek to monitor and manage our significant risk exposures by operating under a set of Board-approved limits and by monitoring certain risk indicators. Our governance framework is designed to comply with applicable requirements and requires regular reporting on metrics and significant risks and exposures to senior management and the Board of Directors.

We have a Board-approved Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that is provided to all employees. The RAS specifies significant risk exposures and addresses the Company's tolerance of those risks, which are categorized as follows, with further information provided below:

•Credit Risk—the risk of loss arising from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its credit obligations

•Liquidity Risk—the potential inability to meet in a timely and cost-effective manner contractual and contingent financial obligations, either on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due

•Market Risk—the risk that asset values or income streams will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 57

Table of Contents 

•Operational Risk—the risk of losses or near misses due to failure of people, processes, and systems, or damage to physical assets

•Information Technology (IT) Risk—the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, influence, and adoption of technology within the Company

•Data Risk—the risk of impairment to or loss of data assets through ineffective governance over the creation, usage, quality, inventory, storage, security and disposal of data assets

•Strategic Risk—the risk of loss of market size, market share, or margin in our business, leading to lost revenues and potentially significant reductions to net income and/or market value

•Reputational Risk—the potential that negative perceptions regarding our conduct or business practices or capacity to conduct business will adversely affect valuation, profitability, operations, or the customer base, or require costly litigation or other measures

•Legal Risk—the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws or ethical standards, as well as uncertainties surrounding the interpretation or application of laws

•Regulatory and Compliance Risk—the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, regulations, applicable guidance, and internal policies, as well as risk associated with ambiguous, changing, or untested rules governing certain regulated products or activities

We are also subject to other risks that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. For additional information see Part I. Item 1A.— Risk Factors.

We manage risk through a governance structure of risk committees, which consist of members of senior management, to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our stated risk profile and consistent with the RAS. A variety of methodologies and measures are used to monitor, quantify, assess and forecast risk. Measurement criteria, methodologies and calculations are reviewed periodically to ensure that risks are represented appropriately. Certain risks are described in the RAS and related policies which establish processes and limits. The RAS and these policies are reviewed, challenged, and approved by certain risk committees and/or the Board of Directors, where applicable, at least annually.

The Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), which consists of independent members of the Board of Directors, reviews, challenges and approves the RAS and certain risk policies each year, receives regular reports on the status of certain limits and Key Risk Indicators and discusses certain key risks. In addition to this Board-level committee, various management committees and subcommittees throughout the Company aid in the identification, measurement and management of risks, including but not limited to:

•Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC)—the ERMC is the senior-most risk management committee and has primary responsibility for approving risk limits and monitoring risk management activities. The ERMC also resolves issues escalated by the other risk management committees and in certain instances approves exceptions to risk policies.

•Asset Liability Committee (ALCO)—the ALCO has primary responsibility for monitoring of market, interest rate, and liquidity risk, and approves related risk limits or recommends related risk limits to be approved by the ERMC.

•Credit Committee—the Credit Committee has responsibility for monitoring credit risks, including risks arising from margin lending activities, and approving risk limits or recommending related risk limits to be approved by the ERMC.

•Operational Risk and Control Committee (ORCC)—the ORCC has responsibility for the oversight and management of the operational risks in all business lines, legal entities, and departments, including the development and reporting of key operational risk metrics. The ORCC has oversight of operational risk management in the existing enterprise risk categories, including: transactions execution risk, 

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 58

Table of Contents 

information security (e.g. cyber security) and other security risks, legal and regulatory risks, systems and information technology risks, and employment risks.

•Technology Risk Committee (TRC)—the TRC provides oversight to ensure that all information security objectives and requirements are met and that policies, programs and plans are implemented.

•Data Governance Committee (DGC)—the DGC is responsible for setting a vision for a clearly defined data governance framework for the Company.

Credit Risk Management

We are exposed to credit risk in the following areas:

•We hold credit risk exposure in our legacy loan portfolio.

•We offer securities-based lending products and margin loans to our customers which leads to the risk of credit losses in the event a customer's assets decline due to adverse market conditions, leaving the account with an unsecured debit that the customer is not able or willing to cover. 

•We engage in financial transactions with counterparties, which expose us to counterparty credit losses or collateral losses in the event a counterparty cannot meet its obligations. These financial transactions include our invested cash, securities lending, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and derivatives portfolios, as well as the settlement of trades.

•We have recently expanded our enterprise RAS and updated our investment policies to permit investments in high-credit quality non-agency securities that include asset-backed securities. We may be exposed to a higher level of credit risk in the future as we purchase such investments.

•There is a risk of deterioration in market value of the Company’s Real Estate Owned (REO) portfolio, in the event of declining property values. Such deterioration will likely coincide with an increase in REO balances driven by incremental defaults in the Company's mortgage and home equity portfolios.

Credit risk is monitored by the Credit Committee. The Credit Committee's objective is to evaluate current and expected credit performance of our loans, investments, borrowers and counterparties relative to market conditions and the probable impact on our financial performance. It establishes credit risk guidelines in accordance with our strategic objectives and existing policies, and reviews investment and lending activities with credit risk to ensure consistency with those established guidelines. These reviews involve an analysis of portfolio balances, delinquencies, losses, recoveries, default management and collateral liquidation performance, as well as any credit risk mitigation efforts relating to the portfolios. In addition, the Credit Committee reviews and approves credit related counterparties engaged in financial transactions with us. The Credit Committee is responsible for corporate governance and oversight with regard to margin risk. The Credit Committee identifies, monitors and mitigates where necessary market, operational and credit risks related to our margin lending activities. 

Loss Mitigation on the Loan Portfolio

Our credit risk team manages the mitigation of credit risk within the loan portfolio. We continue to have loan modification programs that were established to minimize potential losses in the mortgage portfolios by targeting borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, these programs were utilized to modify $15 million and $19 million, respectively, of one- to four-family loans, and $5 million and $15 million, respectively, of home equity loans. These modifications were classified as TDRs. We also process minor modifications on certain loans in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. Minor modifications resulting in an insignificant delay in the timing of payments are not considered economic concessions and therefore are not classified as TDRs. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $7 million and $10 million, respectively, of mortgage loans with minor modifications that were not considered TDRs. We currently do not have any active loan modification programs for consumer loans. 

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 59

Table of Contents 

Currently, our entire mortgage loan portfolio is serviced by third parties. To reduce vendor, operational and regulatory risks, we have assessed our servicing relationships and, where appropriate, consolidated providers or transferred certain mortgage loans to servicers that specialize in managing troubled assets. At December 31, 2018, $1.3 billion gross unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans were held at servicers that specialize in managing troubled assets. We believe this initiative has improved and will continue to improve the credit performance of the loans transferred compared to the expected credit performance of these same loans if they had not been transferred. 

Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is monitored by the ALCO, the ERMC and the ROC. We have in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies as well as contingency funding plans that are intended to maintain our flexibility to address liquidity events specific to us or the market in general. See MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.

Market Risk Management

Market risk is monitored by the Credit Committee, the ALCO, the ERMC and the ROC. The ALCO monitors current and expected market conditions and their probable impact on the Company and provides oversight for interest rate risk. Risks associated with the margin portfolio are reviewed monthly by the Credit Committee. See Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our market risks.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ORCC, the ERMC and the ROC. Operational risk exists in most areas of the Company from processing a transaction to customer service. We are also exposed to fraud risk from unauthorized use of customer and corporate funds and resources. We monitor customer transactions and use scoring tools which prevent a significant number of fraudulent transactions on a daily basis. However, new techniques and strategies are constantly being developed by perpetrators to commit fraud. In order to minimize this threat, we offer our customers various security measures, including a token based multi-factor verification system.

The failure of a third party vendor to adequately meet its responsibilities, which could result in financial loss and impact our reputation, is another significant operational risk. We have a Vendor Management Committee that reports to the ORCC and monitors our vendor relationships. The vendor risk identification process includes reviews of contracts, financial soundness of providers, information security, business continuity and risk management scoring.

Information Technology Risk Management

IT risk is reviewed, challenged and monitored by the TRC, the ORCC, the ERMC and the ROC. The Company faces a wide variety of IT risks, including but not limited to: 

•Cyber and Information Security Risk, which is the potential for misuse, disclosure, loss of, or damage to Company information (including customer data) and information systems that may adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the Company’s information resources 

•Data processing risk, which is the risk of system, communication, application errors or failures, or erroneously executed data extraction, transfer, and load processes that result in data corruption or data loss

•Disaster recovery risk, which is the risk of an incident and lack of planning for incidents that result in unplanned system outages, unavailability, or delay in business continuity

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 60

Table of Contents 

•Change management risk caused by undetected errors or vulnerabilities as a result of a planned or unplanned change to information systems or data that result in ineffective information systems

•IT operations risk which are issues with network, database, application, or infrastructure systems that result in loss of revenue or productivity

Data Risk

Data risk is reviewed, challenged and monitored by the DGC, the ERMC, and the ROC. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks that:

Strategic Risk Management

Strategic risk is reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. These risks include, but are not limited to:

•An ill-defined strategy

•Failure to implement the defined strategy

•Lack of appropriate reaction mechanisms to adapt to changes in the business or regulatory environment

Reputational Risk Management

Reputational risks are reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. Reputational risk can manifest itself in all areas of our business often due to negative publicity associated with other risk types. There is particular reputational risk from many factors including, but not limited to:

•Business disruption, system failures, security breaches, identity theft, vendor, or other cyber related events

•Impact of investigations and lawsuits (with or without merit)

•Publication of regulatory findings

•Conflicts of interest

•Unethical behavior of any employee of the Company or members of the Boards of Directors

•Failure of controls supporting the accuracy of financial reports and disclosures

•Errors in public communication

Legal Risk Management

Legal risks are reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. The following areas of legal risk are particularly pertinent:

•Investigations as a result of alleged or actual business practices, changes in laws or regulatory expectations

•Threatened or actual lawsuits as a result of business disputes as well as alleged or actual business practices

•Failure to take appropriate measures to protect assets (for example, intellectual property) owned by the institution that could lead to a loss in franchise value

•Failure to comply with applicable broker-dealer, securities and banking laws, either domestically or internationally, exposing the Company to disciplinary actions, monetary or other penalties, or restrictions that could significantly harm its business

Regulatory and Compliance Risk Management

Regulatory and Compliance risks are reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. Regulatory and compliance risk exposes the Company to fines, civil money penalties, diminished reputation, reduced franchise value, limited business opportunities and reduced expansion potential. The following areas of regulatory and compliance risk are particularly pertinent: 

•Extensive government regulation, including broker-dealer, banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices.

•Changes in regulation may have a material impact on our operations. In addition, if we are unable to meet these new requirements, the Company could face negative regulatory consequences, which could have a material negative effect on our business.

•Failure to comply with regulations, either domestically or internationally, could subject us to disciplinary actions, monetary or other penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its credit obligations. Our mortgage loan portfolio represents our most significant credit risk exposure.

One- to Four-Family Interest-Only Loans

One- to four-family loans include loans with a five to ten year interest-only period, followed by an amortizing period ranging from 20 to 25 years. At December 31, 2018, nearly 100% of these loans were amortizing.

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 62

Table of Contents 

Home Equity Loans

The home equity loan portfolio consists of home equity installment loans (HEILs) and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and is primarily second lien loans on residential real estate properties that have a higher level of credit risk than first lien mortgage loans. Approximately 9% of the home equity loan portfolio was in the first lien position and we held both the first and second lien positions in less than 1% of the home equity loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. The home equity loan portfolio consists of approximately 17% of HEILs and approximately 83% of HELOCs at December 31, 2018. HEILs are primarily fixed rate and fixed term, fully amortizing loans that do not offer the option of an interest-only payment. The majority of HELOCs had an interest-only draw period at origination and converted to amortizing loans at the end of the draw period, which typically ranged from five to ten years. At December 31, 2018, nearly 100% of the HELOC portfolio had converted from the interest-only draw period.

Securities

We focus primarily on security type and credit rating to monitor credit risk in our securities portfolios. We consider securities backed by the US government or its agencies to have low credit risk as the long-term debt rating of the US government is AA+ by S&P and Aaa by Moody’s at December 31, 2018. The amortized cost of these securities accounted for over 99% of our total securities portfolio at December 31, 2018. We review the remaining debt securities that were not backed by the US government or its agencies according to their credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s where available. At December 31, 2018, all municipal bonds in our securities portfolio were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of "Baa3" or higher, or an S&P rating of “BBB-“ or higher). 

We have recently expanded our enterprise RAS and updated our investment policies to permit investments in high-credit quality non-agency securities that include asset-backed securities. The categories of non-agency securities currently under consideration include asset-backed securities collateralized by credit cards or automobile loans, as well as commercial mortgage-backed securities. While these investments would represent senior classes in the securitization exposures, we may be exposed to a higher level of credit risk in the future as we purchase such investments.

SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented. 

Critical Accounting Estimates

We believe that certain accounting estimates are critical because they require complex and subjective judgments by management. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, we perform ongoing evaluations of the loan portfolio and loss assumptions. For loans that are not TDRs, we establish a general allowance and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment. For modified loans accounted for as TDRs that are valued using the discounted cash flow model, we establish a specific allowance by estimating losses, including economic concessions to borrowers, over the estimated remaining life of these loans. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7—Loans Receivable, Net for additional information on the allowance methodology and the quantitative and qualitative factors considered in determination of the allowance for loan losses.

Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We recognized a benefit to provision for loan losses of $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The benefit recognized reflected better than expected performance of our portfolio as well as recoveries in excess of prior expectations, including sales of charged-off loans and recoveries of previous charge-offs that were not included in our loss estimates. These benefits also reflected enhancements to our allowance for loan loss modeling approach during the periods presented. For example, approximately $70 million of benefit was recognized resulting from default assumptions revised during the second quarter of 2017 based on the sustained outperformance of converted mortgage loans that were previously interest-only and had been amortizing for 12 months or longer. No such enhancements were made during the year ended December 31, 2018.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in the quantitative and qualitative factors might impact the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods. In addition, the timing and magnitude of recoveries, including recoveries of previous charge-offs that were not included in our loss estimates, could also impact our results from operations. Our underlying assumptions and judgments could prove to be inaccurate, which could materially impact our regulatory capital position and results of operations in future periods.

Valuation and Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

Goodwill is recognized as a result of business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis as of November 30 and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a significant

deterioration in the operating environment. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10—Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net for additional information on the valuation and impairment policies governing goodwill and acquired intangible assets. 

The valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets requires significant judgment and estimates by management. For example, the valuation of certain finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Capital One and TCA transactions were performed using the multi-period excess earnings method, a discounted cash flow method, which required management estimates of future earnings and cash flows. The useful life of the finite lived intangible assets was determined based on management's estimate of the period over which those intangible assets are expected to provide economic benefit to the Company. Management also applies judgment in conducting impairment testing for goodwill and finite lived intangible assets, including estimates of fair value based on the income or market approach and estimates required to determine the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets. 

If our estimates of fair value change due to future events differing significantly from the forecasts used to determine fair value, changes in our business or other factors, the Company may recognize an impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If the Company's publicly traded equity were to experience a significant decrease in market capitalization, goodwill would be tested for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives therefore changes in the estimated useful lives could result in the recognition of an impairment or a change in the remaining life of these assets.

Income Taxes

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we calculate income tax expense (benefit) based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain positions to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized and recognize valuation allowances based on our estimates of the amount that is not realizable. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative metrics and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. 

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of the tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the Company's results of operations. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15—Income Taxes for additional information about the Company's income taxes.

Interest Rates and Interest Differential

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates (rate). The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the current year’s average daily balance, with the remaining change applied to volume (dollars in millions):

Nonperforming Assets

We classify loans as nonperforming when they are no longer accruing interest, which includes loans that are 90 days and greater past due, TDRs that are on nonaccrual status for all classes of loans (including loans in bankruptcy) and certain junior liens that have a delinquent senior lien. The following table presents comparative data for nonperforming loans and assets for the past five years (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $12 million of interest income on loans that were nonperforming at December 31, 2018. If our nonperforming loans at December 31, 2018 had been performing in accordance with their terms, we would have recorded additional interest income of approximately $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018 there were no commitments to lend additional funds to any of these borrowers.

Borrowings

Deposits represent our most significant and stable source of funding. In addition, we have utilized wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances and repurchase agreements.

E*TRADE 2018 10-K | Page 71

Table of Contents 

We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. The FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances based on the security of pledged mortgage loans and other assets—principally agency-backed securities—provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. 

We are also able to raise funds by entering into agreements to repurchase the same or similar securities. The counterparties to these agreements hold the securities in custody. We account for repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed- and variable-rate debt securities. We may also participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s term investment option and treasury, tax and loan borrowing programs. We may use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.
