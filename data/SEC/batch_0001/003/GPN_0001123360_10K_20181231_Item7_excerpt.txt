ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "Item 6 - Selected Financial Data" and "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "Item 1A - Risk Factors." See "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" located above "Item 1 - Business." 

General

We are a leading worldwide provider of payment technology and software solutions delivering innovative services to our customers globally. Our technologies, services and employee expertise enable us to provide a broad range of solutions that allow our customers to accept various payment types and operate their businesses more efficiently. We distribute our services across a variety of channels in 32 countries throughout North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Brazil and operate in three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. 

We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company in 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payment technology services business since 1967. Since our spin-off, we have expanded in existing markets and into new markets internationally by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures, including recent acquisitions of technology-enabled and software-driven businesses. In April 2016, we merged with Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. ("Heartland"), which significantly expanded our small and medium-sized enterprise distribution, merchant base and vertical reach in the United States. 

We provide payment technology and software solutions to customers globally. Our payment technology solutions are similar around the world in that we enable our customers to accept card, electronic, check and digital-based payments. Our comprehensive offerings include, but are not limited to, authorization services, settlement and funding services, customer support and help-desk functions, chargeback resolution, terminal rental, sales and deployment, payment security services, consolidated billing and statements and on-line reporting.

In addition, we offer a wide array of enterprise software solutions that streamline business operations to customers in numerous vertical markets. We also provide a variety of value-added services, including analytic and engagement tools, payroll services and reporting that assist our customers with driving demand and operating their businesses more efficiently. 

The majority of our revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on the card type or the vertical. We also earn software subscription and licensing fees, as well as other fees based on specific value-added services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions.

Our primary business model is to actively market and provide our payment services, enterprise software solutions and other value-added services directly to our customers through a variety of distribution channels. We offer high-touch services that provide our customers with reliable and secure solutions coupled with high quality and responsive support services. Through our direct sales force worldwide, as well as bank partnerships, which we generally refer to as "direct distribution," we offer our payment technology services, software and other value-added solutions directly to customers in the markets we serve. In addition, we also provide certain of our services through a wholesale distribution channel where we do not maintain the face-to-face relationship with the customer. As we continue to grow and control our direct distribution by adding new channels and partners, including expanding our ownership of additional enterprise software solutions in select vertical markets, our wholesale distribution channel has become a smaller portion of our business. 

We seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. We also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and the Latin America region. 

31
In general, our business has not experienced pronounced seasonality. However, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the merchant portfolio. 

In 2016, we changed our fiscal year end from May 31 to December 31. As a result, the period consisting of the seven months ended December 31, 2016 is considered the "2016 fiscal transition period." When our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period are compared to our financial results for the prior-year periods, the results compare the twelve-month period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 to the twelve-month period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and compare the seven-month period from June 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 to the seven-month period from June 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and the seven months ended December 31, 2015 are unaudited.

Segment Information

For a description of our reportable segments see "Note 16—Segment Information" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Executive Overview

As more fully described in "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 3—Revenues" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we adopted a new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018 that results in revenue being presented net of certain fees that we pay to third parties, including payment networks. This change in presentation affected our reported revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 by the same amount and had no effect on operating income.

We experienced strong business and financial performance around the world during the year ended December 31, 2018. Highlights related to our financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2018 and for the year then ended include the following:

Emerging Trends

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result, certain large payment technology companies, including us, have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures. We expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures. 

We believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies. As a result, we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies; however, we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to increase materially from our current level of spending as a result of this.

We also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. We expect industries such as education, government and healthcare, as well as recurring payments and business-to-business payments, to continue to see transactions migrate to electronic-based solutions. We anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future.

Recent Acquisitions

On October 17, 2018, we acquired SICOM Systems, Inc. ("SICOM") for total purchase consideration of approximately $409 million, which we funded with cash on hand and by drawing on our Revolving Credit Facility (described in "Note 8—Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). SICOM is a provider of end-to-end enterprise, cloud-based software solutions and other technologies to quick service restaurants and food service management companies. 

On September 4, 2018, we acquired AdvancedMD, Inc. ("AdvancedMD") for total purchase consideration of approximately $707 million, which we funded with cash on hand and by drawing on our Revolving Credit Facility. AdvancedMD is a provider of cloud-based enterprise software solutions to small-to-medium sized ambulatory care physician practices in the United States. 

On September 1, 2017, we acquired the communities and sports divisions of Athlaction Topco, LLC ("ACTIVE Network") for total purchase consideration of $1.2 billion, consisting of approximately $600 million in cash and 6.4 million shares of our common stock. We funded the cash consideration primarily by drawing on our Revolving Credit Facility. ACTIVE Network delivers cloud-based enterprise software, including payment technology solutions, to event organizers in the communities and health and fitness vertical markets. 

These acquisitions align with our technology-enabled, software driven strategy and add enterprise software businesses operating in existing vertical markets that we serve and additional vertical markets that we believe offer attractive growth fundamentals. See "Note 2—Acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other acquisitions.

Results of Operations

Revenues

As more fully described in "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 3—Revenues" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we adopted a new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018 that results in revenue being presented net of certain fees that we pay to third parties, including payment networks. This change in presentation affected our reported revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 by the same amount and had no effect on operating income.

33
The majority of our revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type or the vertical. We also earn software subscription and licensing fees, as well as other fees based on specific value-added services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions. These revenues depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.

We provide payment technology and software solutions to customers and fund settlement either directly, in markets where we have direct membership with the payment networks, or through our relationship with a member financial institution in markets where we are sponsored. Revenues are recognized in the amount of customer billing net of interchange fees and, beginning in 2018, payment network fees. We market our services through a variety of sales channels, including a direct sales force, trade associations, agent and enterprise software providers and referral arrangements with value-added resellers ("VARs"), which we generally refer to as "direct distribution." We also sell services through our ISO channel, where the ISO receives a share of the customer profitability in the form of a monthly residual payment, which is reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 

Operating Expenses

Cost of Service

Cost of service consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; the cost of transaction processing systems, including third-party services; the cost of network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets and provisions for operating losses. For periods prior to 2018, payment network fees were included in cost of service.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, customer support functions other than those supporting revenue, administrative employees and management; acquisition and integration expenses; amortization of capitalized customer acquisition costs; residuals paid to ISOs; fees paid to VARs, independent contractors and other third parties; other selling expenses; occupancy costs of leased space directly related to these functions; share-based compensation expense and advertising costs.

Operating Income and Operating Margin

For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to "operating income," which is calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenues. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption "Corporate." Similarly, we refer to "operating margin" regarding segment operations, which is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenues.

(1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding.

(2) As more fully described in "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 3—Revenues" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we adopted a new revenue accounting standard on January 1, 2018 that results in revenue being presented net of certain fees that we pay to third parties, including payment networks. This change in presentation affected our reported revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 by the same amount and had no effect on operating income; however, the change in presentation did have the effect of increasing our operating margin, which is calculated by dividing operating income by revenue.

(3) Revenues, operating expenses, operating income and operating margin reflect the effect of acquired businesses from the respective dates of acquisition. For further discussion, see "Note 2—Acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(4) During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating loss for Corporate included acquisition and integration expenses of $56.1 million and $94.6 million, respectively, which are included primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

35
Revenues

Effective January 1, 2018, our revenues are presented net of certain fees that we pay to third parties, including payment networks. This change in presentation affected our reported revenues and operating expenses for 2018 by the same amount and had no effect on operating income. Consolidated revenues without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased by 12.6% to $4,475.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

North America Segment. The change in presentation decreased our reported North America segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $726.3 million. Revenues from our North America segment without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased by 10.8% to $3,247.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of ACTIVE Network. 

Europe Segment. The change in presentation decreased our reported Europe segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $307.3 million. Revenues from our Europe segment without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased by 19.6% to $918.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to organic growth.

Asia-Pacific Segment. The change in presentation decreased our reported Asia-Pacific segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $77.2 million. Revenues from our Asia-Pacific segment without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased by 11.6% to $310.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to organic growth.

Operating Expenses

Cost of Service. Effective January 1, 2018, the new revenue accounting standard changed our presentation of certain fees that we pay to third parties, including payment networks, which decreased cost of service by $1,042.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of service without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased by 11.2% to $2,143.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to additional costs associated with revenue growth and an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles of $39.8 million. Cost of service without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard as a percentage of revenues without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard were 47.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 48.5% for the prior year.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Effective January 1, 2018, the new revenue accounting standard changed our presentation of certain fees that we pay to third parties, which decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Selling, general and administrative expense without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased by 9.6% to $1,631.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to additional costs to support the growth of our business, partially offset by a reduction in acquisition and integration expenses of $38.5 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard as a percentage of revenues without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard decreased to 36.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 37.4% for the prior year, primarily due to the reduction in acquisition and integration expenses.

Operating Income and Operating Margin

North America Segment. Operating income in our North America segment increased by 24.9% to $570.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of ACTIVE Network. Operating margin without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased to 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 15.6% for the prior year.

Europe Segment. Operating income in our Europe segment increased by 16.7% to $318.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to organic growth. Operating margin without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard decreased to 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 35.5% for the prior year, due to the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations.

36
Asia-Pacific Segment. Operating income in our Asia-Pacific segment increased by 14.9% to $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to organic growth. Operating margin without the effect of the new revenue accounting standard increased to 29.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 29.2% for the prior year.

Corporate. Corporate expenses decreased by 2.7% to $245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses of $38.5 million, partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation expense of $18.7 million and additional costs to support the growth of our business.

Other Income/Expense, Net

Interest and other income increased by $12.1 million to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a gain of $9.6 million recognized on the reorganization of a debit network association of which we were a member through one of our Canadian subsidiaries.

Interest and other expense increased by $20.8 million to $195.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects an increase in our outstanding long-term debt to fund acquisitions as well as an increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").

Income Tax Benefit (Provision)

We reported an income tax provision of $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to analyze our foreign tax pools and resulting foreign tax credits and reduced our estimated transition tax liability, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $23.3 million. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 13.8%, which reflects the benefit of the adjustment to the one-time transition tax liability.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported an income tax benefit of $101.4 million, reflecting the effect of a provisional net income tax benefit of $158.7 million recorded in connection with the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a benefit of 25.8%, which differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate and the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the net tax benefit we recorded in connection with the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. See "Note 10—Income Tax" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion about the effects of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act on our accounting for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The following table sets forth key selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between periods in dollars and as a percentage of the prior-period amount. The income statement data for the year ended December 31, 2017 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The income statement data for the year ended December 31, 2016 are derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements for that period.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding.

(2) Revenues, operating expenses, operating income and operating margin reflect the effect of acquired businesses from the respective dates of acquisition. For further discussion, see "Note 2—Acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(3) During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, operating loss for Corporate included acquisition and integration expenses of $94.6 million and $142.1 million, respectively, which are included primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

Revenues

For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues increased by $604.2 million, or 17.9%, compared to the prior year, to $3,975.2 million, reflecting growth in each of our operating segments. 

North America Segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our North America segment increased by $454.2 million, or 18.3%, compared to the prior year, to $2,929.5 million primarily due to our merger with Heartland, the results of 

38
which were included in our consolidated statement of income for a full year during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to approximately eight months during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Europe Segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our Europe segment increased by $112.0 million, or 17.1%, compared to the prior year, to $767.5 million, primarily due to organic growth.

Asia-Pacific Segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our Asia-Pacific segment increased by $37.9 million, or 15.8%, compared to the prior year, to $278.1 million, primarily due to organic growth.

Operating Expenses

Cost of Service. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of service increased by $324.5 million, or 20.2%, compared to the prior year, to $1,928.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, cost of service increased to 48.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 47.6% for the prior year. These increases were driven primarily by an increase in the variable costs associated with our revenue growth, including incremental expenses associated with acquired businesses, as well as additional intangible asset amortization associated with recently acquired businesses of $78.6 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $77.2 million, or 5.5%, compared to the prior year, to $1,488.3 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional costs to support the growth of our business, including incremental expenses associated with acquired businesses. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 41.9% for the prior year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to synergies achieved in general and administrative expenses from the merger with Heartland, as well as the decrease in acquisition and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $47.5 million.

Operating Income and Operating Margin

North America Segment. Operating income in our North America segment increased by 30.5% to $457.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year and operating margin increased by 1.4 percentage points. The increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue growth in our U.S. business, which during the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially offset by additional intangible asset amortization associated with acquired businesses. The increase in operating margin during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to revenue growth and a decrease in Heartland customer-related intangible asset amortization, which is calculated using an accelerated method.

Europe Segment. Operating income in our Europe segment increased by 17.1% to $272.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, while operating margin remained equal to the prior year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue growth. 

Asia-Pacific Segment. Operating income in our Asia-Pacific segment increased by 38.4% to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year and operating margin increased by 4.8 percentage points. The increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to organic revenue growth.

Corporate. Corporate expenses decreased by 11.7% to $252.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses.

Other Income/Expense, Net

Interest and other income decreased by $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, which included a gain of $41.2 million in connection with the sale of our membership interests in Visa Europe.

Interest and other expense increased by $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt facilities increased significantly in April 2016 as a result of incremental borrowings we made to fund a portion of the total consideration for our merger with Heartland. Since then, we have made principal repayments 

39
that have lowered our average outstanding borrowings, and we have lowered the leverage-based margins we pay on interest rates through refinancing activities that we completed in October 2016 and May 2017. The savings in interest expense that we realized during the second half of 2017 due to these refinancing activities were partially offset by increases in LIBOR during the intervening time frame and additional borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to complete the acquisition of ACTIVE Network.

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision

We reported an income tax benefit of $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the effect of a provisional net income tax benefit of $158.7 million recorded in connection with the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a benefit of 25.8%, which differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate and the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the net tax benefit we recorded in connection with the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. See "Note 10—Income Tax" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion about the effects of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act on our accounting for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $36.3 million, which equated to an effective tax rate of 14.1%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a benefit from eliminating certain net deferred tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings from Canada, as a result of management's plans at that time to reinvest these earnings outside the United States indefinitely.

Seven Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Seven Months Ended December 31, 2015 

The following table sets forth key selected financial data for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between periods in dollars and as a percentage of the prior-period amount. The income statement data for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The income statement data for the seven months ended December 31, 2015 are derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements for that period.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding.

(2) Revenues, operating expenses, operating income and operating margin reflect the effect of acquired businesses from the respective dates of acquisition. Notably, on April 22, 2016, we merged with Heartland as further discussed in "Note 2—Acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(3) During the seven months ended December 31, 2016, operating loss for Corporate included acquisition and integration costs of $91.6 million, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

Revenues

For the seven months ended December 31, 2016, revenues increased 27.3% to $2,202.9 million compared to the prior-year period, reflecting growth in each of our operating segments, in spite of the unfavorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the seven months ended December 31, 2016, currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by $35.3 million compared to the prior-year period, calculated by converting revenues for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 in local currencies using exchange rates for the seven months ended December 31, 2015.

41
North America Segment. For the seven months ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our North America segment increased by $422.7 million, or 34.4%, compared to the prior-year period to $1,650.6 million primarily due to our merger with Heartland. 

Europe Segment. For the seven months ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our Europe segment increased by $23.6 million, or 6.2%, compared to the prior-year period to $403.8 million due to a joint venture with Erste Group Bank AG ("Erste Group") in Central and Eastern Europe that commenced in June 2016, despite the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations in Europe of $34.3 million.

Asia-Pacific Segment. For the seven months ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our Asia-Pacific segment increased by $26.5 million, or 21.8%, compared to the prior-year period to $148.5 million, primarily due to organic growth.

Operating Expenses

Cost of Service. Cost of service increased by 71.4% to $1,094.6 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period. As a percentage of revenues, cost of service increased to 49.7% for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 36.9% in the prior year. The increase in cost of service was driven primarily by an increase in the variable costs associated with our revenue growth, including those related to our merger with Heartland, and by additional intangible asset amortization associated with recently acquired businesses of $145.6 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 10.9% to $870.4 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 39.5% for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to 45.4% in the prior year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional costs to support the growth of our business, including incremental expenses associated with the integration of Heartland. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to synergies achieved in general and administrative expenses from the merger with Heartland.

North America Segment. Operating income in our North America segment increased by 22.3% to $233.9 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue growth in our U.S. business, partially offset by expenses associated with the integration of Heartland and additional intangible asset amortization associated with the merger. Operating margin decreased by 1.4 percentage points for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of the incremental merger-related expenses.

Europe Segment. Operating income in our Europe segment decreased by 7.6% to $145.8 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period, including the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations of $19.6 million. Operating margin decreased 5.4 percentage points for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period. The decreases in operating income and operating margin were primarily driven by the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations.

Asia-Pacific Segment. Operating income in our Asia segment increased by 26.9% to $37.5 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period. Operating margin increased 1.0 percentage point for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period. The increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to organic revenue growth.

Corporate. Corporate expenses increased by $107.3 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the merger with Heartland and incremental expenses of $91.6 million associated with its integration.

Other Income/Expense, Net

Interest and other income for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 increased primarily due to a gain of $41.2 million recorded in connection with the sale of our membership interests in Visa Europe.

Interest and other expense increased by $76.8 million for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-

42
year period primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred resulting from an increase in the outstanding borrowings to fund the merger with Heartland.

Income Tax Provision

Our effective income tax rates were 20.6% and 25.3%, respectively, for the seven months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of income generated in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates (primarily as a result of the acquisition and integration-related expenses incurred in the United States).

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments.

Our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. We use our financing, such as term loans and our Revolving Credit Facility, for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. In addition, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card network. We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise.

At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,210.9 million. Of this amount, we consider $434.5 million to be available for general purposes, of which approximately $18 million is undistributed foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Under the 2017 U.S. Tax Act, a company's foreign earnings accumulated under legacy tax laws are deemed repatriated, and the 2017 U.S. Tax Act generally eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The available cash of $434.5 million does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses ("Merchant Reserves") and (iii) funds held for customers. Settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement-related cash balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. Merchant Reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. Funds held for customers and the corresponding liability that we record in "customer deposits" include amounts collected prior to remittance on our customers' behalf.

Operating activities provided net cash of $1,106.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily attributable to net income of $484.7 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $522.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $44.5 million. 

Fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities are affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume, especially changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities, and by the effects of businesses we acquire that have different working capital requirements. Changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by $83.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and decreased operating cash flows by $361.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by $35.6 million during the 2016 fiscal transition period and $218.1 million during the year ended May 31, 2016. 

Operating activities provided net cash of $512.4 million, $515.8 million and $592.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the transition period ended December 31, 2016 and the year ended May 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities since 2016, during which time we completed the acquisitions of Heartland, ACTIVE Network, AdvancedMD and SICOM, among others, was primarily due to our revenue growth and corresponding increase in operating income. The increase in operating cash flows from our growing business during this period was partially offset by investments made to integrate the acquired businesses. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016 we incurred $56.1 million, $94.6 million, $91.6 million and $51.3 million, respectively, of acquisition and 

43
integration expenses primarily related to the acquired businesses. In addition, during that same period of time, our interest expense has increased as a result of long-term debt we have issued, primarily to help fund these acquisitions, as well as increases in interest rates. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, cash paid for interest expense was $177.5 million, $154.2 million, $93.6 million and $58.7 million, respectively. Based on the recent increase in our level of indebtedness to fund acquisitions, together with recent increases in interest rates, we expect our interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2019 to increase compared to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, which could affect our cash flows and earnings.

We used net cash in investing activities of $1,476.3 million, $736.0 million, $86.7 million and $2,127.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, respectively. Cash used for investing activities represents primarily cash used to fund business acquisitions and capital expenditures. 

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, respectively, we used cash of $1,259.7 million, $562.7 million, $33.9 million and $2,034.4 million to complete acquisitions. In addition to cash, we used our common stock to fund a portion of the consideration for both the Heartland and ACTIVE Network acquisitions. See "Note 2—Acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our business acquisitions and how we funded acquired businesses.

We made capital expenditures of $213.3 million, $181.9 million, $88.9 million and $91.6 million to purchase property and equipment (including internal-use capitalized software development projects) during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, respectively. These investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms and infrastructure to support our growing business.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold our operating facility in Jeffersonville, Indiana for $37.5 million. In addition, during the 2016 fiscal transition period we exchanged all of our membership interest in Visa Europe to Visa for up-front consideration, including cash of approximately $37.7 million.

Financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our Credit Facility (described in "Note 8—Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities. Our borrowing arrangements are further described below under "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit." Financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and share-based compensation programs as well as cash distributions made to noncontrolling interests and our shareholders. Cash flows from financing activities provided net cash of $286.9 million and $352.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. During the 2016 fiscal transition period, we used net cash in financing activities of $278.8 million. During the year ended May 31, 2016, cash flows from financing activities provided net cash of $1,957.6 million.

Proceeds from long-term debt were $2.8 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $6.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, respectively. Repayments of long-term debt were $2.3 billion, $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $3.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, respectively. Proceeds from long-term debt include borrowings that we make from time-to-time under our Revolving Credit Facility, including those we have made to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for acquired businesses. Repayments of long-term debt include repayments that we make from time-to-time under our Revolving Credit Facility as well as scheduled principal repayments made under our term loans. Debt issuance costs reflect the amount of fees we paid to complete these borrowing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repatriated $457.7 million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries and used the cash to reduce outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 

Because we often receive funding from the payment networks after we fund our merchants, we have specialized lines of credit in various markets where we do business to fund settlement. Activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period, we had net proceeds from settlement lines of credit of $70.8 million, $221.5 million and $20.6 million, respectively. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we had net repayments of settlement lines of credit of $206.0 million.

44
We make repurchases of our common stock mainly through open market repurchase plans and, at times, through accelerated share repurchase programs. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016, we invested cash of $208.2 million, $34.8 million, $178.2 million and $136.0 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we had $387.8 million of share repurchase authority remaining under a program authorized by the board of directors, announced on February 6, 2018. On February 5, 2019, the board of directors increased its authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock to $750 million, inclusive of prior share repurchase programs authorized by the board and repurchases made thereunder.

We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our long-term debt and lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. 

Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit

We are party to a credit facility agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and other agents (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Facility"). As of December 31, 2018, the Credit Facility provided for secured financing comprised of (i) a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"); (ii) a $1.5 billion term loan (the "Term A Loan"), (iii) a $1.37 billion term loan (the "Term A-2 Loan"), (iv) a $1.14 billion term loan facility (the "Term B-2 Loan") and (v) a $500 million term loan (the "Term B-4 Loan"). Substantially all of the assets of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate outstanding balance on the term loans was $4.5 billion, and the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $704.0 million.

The borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2018 reflect amounts borrowed for acquisitions and other activities we completed in 2018, including a reduction to the interest rate margins applicable to our Term A Loan, Term A-2 Loan, Term B-2 Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, an extension of the maturity dates of the Term A Loan, Term A-2 Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, and an increase in the total financing capacity under the Credit Facility to approximately $5.5 billion in June 2018. 

In October 2018, we entered into an additional term loan in the amount of $500 million (the "Term B-4 Loan"). We used the proceeds from the Term B-4 Loan to pay down a portion of the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility provides for an interest rate, at our election, of either LIBOR or a base rate, in each case plus a margin. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rates on the Term A Loan, the Term A-2 Loan, the Term B-2 Loan and the Term B-4 Loan were 4.02%, 4.01%, 4.27% and 4.27%, respectively, and the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.92%. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee with respect to the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% depending on our leverage ratio. 

The Term A Loan and the Term A-2 Loan mature, and the Revolving Credit Facility expires, on January 20, 2023. The Term B-2 Loan matures on April 22, 2023. The Term B-4 Loan matures on October 18, 2025. The Term A Loan and Term A-2 Loan principal amounts must each be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 0.625% of principal through June 2019, increasing to 1.25% of principal through June 2021, increasing to 1.875% of principal through June 2022 and increasing to 2.50% of principal through December 2022, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in January 2023. The Term B-2 Loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 0.25% of principal through March 2023, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in April 2023. The Term B-4 Loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 0.25% of principal through September 2025, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in October 2025.

We may issue standby letters of credit of up to $100 million in the aggregate under the Revolving Credit Facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. Borrowings available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility are further limited by the covenants described below under "Compliance with Covenants." The total available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 were $783.6 million.

45
Settlement Lines of Credit

In various markets where we do business, we have specialized lines of credit, which are restricted for use in funding settlement. The settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. For certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. Accordingly, the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, a total of $70.6 million and $59.3 million, respectively, of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we had $700.5 million and $635.2 million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity of $710.3 million as of December 31, 2018 to fund settlement. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 2.97% and 1.97% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Compliance with Covenants

The Credit Facility Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on our leverage and interest coverage ratios, as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, financial covenants under the Credit Facility Agreement required a leverage ratio no greater than: (i) 5.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from April 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019; (ii) 4.75 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020; and (iii) 4.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The interest coverage ratio is required to be no less than 3.25 to 1.00. 

The Credit Facility Agreement and settlement lines of credit also include various other covenants that are customary in such borrowings. The Credit Facility Agreement includes covenants, subject in each case to exceptions and qualifications that may restrict certain payments, including, in certain circumstances, the repurchasing of our common stock and paying cash dividends in excess of our current rate of $0.01 per share per quarter. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2018.

See "Note 8—Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our borrowing arrangements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than the guarantee services described in "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

BIN/ICA Agreements

We have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. These agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number ("BIN") for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association ("ICA") number for Mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and Mastercard. Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2018.

46
Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Interest on long-term debt is based on rates effective and amounts borrowed as of December 31, 2018. The estimated effect of interest rate swaps is included in interest on long-term debt. Since the contractual rates for our long-term debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided. 

(2) Operating lease obligations include approximately $70 million for operating lease agreements not commenced at December 31, 2018.

(3) Includes estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts.

The table above excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, and as a result, actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments. We have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors. 

Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in "Item 1A - Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Goodwill

We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary. The option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit.

Factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. If we elect to 

47
bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required. 

We have seven reporting units: North America Payments, Integrated Solutions and Vertical Markets, United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Spain. As of October 1, 2018, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for each of our reporting units. We determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of each reporting unit was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts. We believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount. 

Intangible and Long-lived Assets

Other intangible assets include customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), acquired technologies and trademarks and trade names associated with business combinations. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets. We use the straight-line method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names and contract-based intangibles.

Amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. If the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the expected distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2018.

We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. Fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision. 

Capitalization of Internal-Use Software

We develop software that is used in providing services to customers. Capitalization of internal-use software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. The carrying amount of internal-use software, including work-in-progress, at December 31, 2018 was $404.6 million. Costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2018, the year ended December 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended May 31, 2016 totaled $97.9 million, $79.3 million, $37.7 million and $36.5 million, respectively. Internal-use software is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 2 to 10 years, in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets.

48
Income Taxes

We determine our provision for income taxes using management's judgments, estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 

Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740") requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. To address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which in March 2018 was codified by the FASB in ASC 740. SAB 118 provides guidance for registrants regarding the application of ASC Topic 740 in the reporting period that includes December 22, 2017, including reporting provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined. In addition, SAB 118 requires provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts identified in the measurement period, as defined, to be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined.

As a result of the enactment of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act, our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a net benefit of $158.7 million, reflecting provisional amounts for specific income tax effects as a result of the enactment of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act for which our accounting was incomplete but could be reasonably estimated as of December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to analyze our foreign tax pools and resulting foreign tax credits and reduced the estimated transition tax liability, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $23.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the transition effects of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act.

We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized. When facts and circumstances change (including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), the effect is recognized in the period of change. The unrecognized tax benefits that exist at December 31, 2018 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future, if recognized. Judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. 

Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements - Recently Issued Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

As more fully described in "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2019, we will adopt a new lease accounting standard that requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases. The application of the new lease accounting standard will also require several new disclosures. We have made substantial progress in the execution of our implementation plan, and we are substantially complete with our evaluation of the effect of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. We currently estimate that we will recognize lease liabilities on the balance sheet of approximately $275 million at adoption for our operating leases. We expect right of use assets will be approximately $235 million, reflecting adjustments for the net amount of lease-related items previously recognized on the balance sheet. We do not expect adoption to have a material effect on any line items in our consolidated statement of income or on our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities included in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Refer to "Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new lease accounting standard and other recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.

ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
