Overview 

Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, Suriname, Canada and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have participated in twelve significant discoveries. The Liza Phase 1 development was sanctioned in 2017 and is expected to startup in early 2020 with production reaching up to 120,000 gross bopd. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2025. 

Our Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. 

In 2018, we completed the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio, onshore U.S., and during 2017 we sold our interests in Equatorial Guinea, Norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin, onshore U.S. These sales, which generated total proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, are consistent with our strategy to high grade our portfolio by divesting lower return, mature assets to invest in higher return assets, primarily in Guyana and the Bakken, and to provide returns to shareholders. During 2018, we repurchased $1.38 billion of common stock (2017: $120 million), repaid debt of $633 million, and paid dividends of $345 million. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion excluding Midstream. 

Outlook 

We project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.9 billion in 2019. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $330 million. Oil and gas production in 2019 is forecast to be in the range of 270,000 boepd to 280,000 boepd excluding Libya, up from 248,000 boepd in 2018, excluding Libya and assets sold. We have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 95,000 bopd. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,939 million in 2018, compared to $945 million in 2017, while capital expenditures for 2018 and 2017 were $2,180 million and $1,973 million, respectively. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2019, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends through the end of 2019. 

Consolidated Results 

Net loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $282 million in 2018 (2017: $4,074 million; 2016: $6,132 million). Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 26, the adjusted net loss was $176 million in 2018 (2017: $1,401 million; 2016: $1,489 million). Annual production averaged 277,000 boepd in 2018 (2017: 306,000 boepd; 2016: 322,000 boepd). Total proved reserves were 1,192 million boe at December 31, 2018 (2017: 1,154 million boe; 2016: 1,109 million boe).

Significant 2018 Activities 

The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2018: 

Producing E&P assets: 

•  

In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 117,000 boepd (2017: 105,000 boepd). During 2018, we operated an average of 4.8 rigs, drilled 121 wells, completed 118 wells, and brought on production 104 wells. During 2018, we transitioned from utilizing sliding sleeve completion designs to plug and perf completions. During 2019, we plan to operate six rigs, drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 160 wells on production. From 2019, all production wells will use plug and perf completions, which we expect will allow us to increase peak net production to approximately 200,000 boepd by 2021. We forecast net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 135,000 boepd to 145,000 boepd.  

•  

In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 57,000 boepd (2017: 54,000 boepd). The increase in production was primarily due to the Stampede and Penn State Fields, partially offset by the impact of downtime from a planned well workover at the Tubular Bells Field, the shutdown at the third-party operated Enchilada platform, and natural field decline. We forecast Gulf of Mexico net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 65,000 boepd to 70,000 boepd. 

•  

In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 36,000 boepd for the year (2017: 37,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay Basin averaged 27,000 boepd for the year (2017: 11,000 boepd). Production from the North Malay Basin full-field development project commenced in July 2017. During 2018 we drilled three production wells at North Malay Basin, and plan to continue the drilling program and development activities in 2019.  

We forecast Gulf of Thailand net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 60,000 boepd and 65,000 boepd. 

•  

In Denmark, we announced that we decided to retain our interest in the Hess operated offshore South Arne Field after offers received in a previously announced sale process did not meet our value expectations. During 2019, we plan to drill an exploration well on License 06/16, located approximately 19 miles from South Arne. 

Other E&P assets: 

•  

Offshore Guyana, at the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited progressed the first phase of the Liza Field development, which was sanctioned in 2017. The Liza Phase 1 development, which is expected to begin producing oil by early 2020 will use the Liza Destiny FPSO to produce up to 120,000 gross bopd. Drilling of development wells in the Liza Field is continuing, subsea equipment is being prepared for installation, and the topside facilities modules have been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO in Singapore, which is expected to arrive offshore Guyana in the third quarter of 2019. Preparations are also underway for the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines at the Liza Field in the spring of 2019. 

Phase 2 of the Liza Field development is expected to start production by mid-2022. Pending government and regulatory approvals, project sanction for Phase 2 is expected by the operator in the first quarter of 2019 and will include a second FPSO vessel designed to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd. Project sanction for a third phase of development at the Payara Field is expected in 2019 with first production expected to start up as early as 2023. In addition to the first three phases, development planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and timing will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling. 

The operator is currently utilizing three drillships on the block. The Stena Carron and the Noble Tom Madden, which arrived in the third quarter of 2018, are involved in exploration and appraisal drilling. The Noble Bob Douglas is drilling development wells for Liza Phase 1. In 2018, the following explorations wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block (in chronological order): 

Ranger-1: The well, located approximately 60 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. 

Pacora-1: The well encountered approximately 65 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir, and is located approximately four miles west of the Payara-1 well, which was drilled in 2017. The operator plans to integrate this discovery into the Payara Field development. 

Liza-5: The well encountered 77 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately six miles northwest of the Liza-1 well, which was drilled in 2016. 

23 

Sorubim-1: The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. 

Longtail-1: The well encountered approximately 256 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately five miles west of the Turbot-1 well, which was drilled in 2017.  

Hammerhead-1: The well encountered approximately 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 13 miles to the southwest of the Liza-1 well.  

Pluma-1: The well encountered approximately 121 feet of high-quality, hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone reservoir and represents the tenth discovery on the Block. The well is located approximately 17 miles south of the Turbot-1 well.  

In February 2019, the operator announced the eleventh and twelfth discoveries on the Stabroek Block at the Tilapia-1 and Haimara-1 wells. The Tilapia-1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir, and is located approximately three miles west of the Longtail-1 well. The Haimara-1 well encountered approximately 207 feet of high-quality, gas condensate-bearing sandstone reservoir, and is located approximately 19 miles east of the Pluma-1 well. 

•  

At Block 42 (Hess - 33%), offshore Suriname, the operator, Kosmos Energy Ltd., completed drilling operations on the Pontoenoe-1 exploration well. Commercial quantities of hydrocarbons were not discovered and well results will be integrated into the ongoing evaluation for future exploration on the block. Total well costs charged to exploration expenses were $33 million. 

•  

In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia (Hess - 50%), the operator, BP Canada, completed drilling of the Aspy exploration well, which did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Total well costs charged to exploration expenses were $120 million. 

The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2018: 

•  

In December 2018, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with HIP to sell HIP our water handling business for $225 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The parties expect to execute definitive agreements and close the transaction in the first quarter of 2019, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals. 

24 

Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures 

In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,939 million (2017: $945 million; 2016: $795 million). At December 31, 2018, consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $2,694 million (2017: $4,847 million), consolidated debt was $6,672 million (2017: $6,977 million), and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 38.0% (2017: 36.1%). 

Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions):

Consolidated Results of Operations 

Results by Segment: 

The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. 

In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. 

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: 

The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 35. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation presented in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income (loss).

Comparison of Results 

Exploration and Production 

Following is a summarized statement of income for our E&P operations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31, the changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. 

27 

Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 23% higher in 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGLs increased in 2018 by 19% and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2018 by 24%, compared to the prior year. In total, higher realized selling prices improved 2018 financial results by approximately $700 million after income taxes, compared with 2017. Our average selling prices were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Selling prices in the United States are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses. Excluding these fees Worldwide selling prices for 2018 would be $63.77 per barrel for crude oil (including hedging), $66.80 per barrel for crude oil (excluding hedging), $22.00 per barrel for NGLs and $4.25 per mcf for natural gas. 

Net realized losses from crude oil hedging contracts reduced Sales and other operating revenues by $183 million ($183 million after income taxes) in 2018, and $59 million ($59 million after income taxes) in 2017. There were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016. We have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel on 95,000 bopd for $116 million, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis during 2019. 

28 

Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2019, we expect net production, excluding Libya, to average between 270,000 boepd and 280,000 boepd, compared to full year pro forma 2018 net production, excluding Libya and assets sold, of 248,000 boepd.  

Production variances related to 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows: 

United States: Bakken net production was higher in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to increased drilling activity and improved well performance in the current year. The year-on-year decline in U.S. other onshore production in 2018 and 2017 reflects the sale of our interests in the Utica shale play in August 2018 and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. Total U.S. offshore oil production was higher in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the Stampede and Penn State Fields, partially offset by the impact of downtime from a planned well workover at the Tubular Bells Field, the shutdown at the third-party operated Enchilada platform, and natural field decline. Total offshore production was lower in 2017, compared to 2016, due to shut-in production from the fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform and natural field decline, partially offset by higher production from the Tubular Bells Field. Production from Utica averaged 9,000 boepd for calendar year 2018 (2017: 19,000 boepd; 2016: 29,000 boepd). Production from the Permian averaged net 4,000 boepd for calendar year 2017 (2016: 7,000 boepd).  

Europe: Total net production was lower in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of our interests in Norway in December 2017. Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to natural field decline. Production in Norway averaged 24,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 28,000 boepd). 

29 

Africa: Crude oil production was lower in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily reflecting the sale of Equatorial Guinea in November 2017, partially offset by higher production in Libya. Crude oil production in 2017 was comparable to 2016, as lower volumes from Equatorial Guinea were offset by higher production in Libya. Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged 25,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 33,000 boepd). Production in Libya was 20,000 boepd in 2018 (2017: 10,000 boepd; 2016: 1,000 boepd). 

Asia: Natural gas production was higher in 2018, compared to 2017, and in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to first production at the North Malay Basin full-field development in July 2017. 

Sales Volumes: The impact of lower sales volumes, primarily due to asset sales, decreased after-tax results by approximately $150 million in 2018, compared to 2017. Worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, excluding sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third-parties, were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Marketing, including purchased oil and gas: Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGLs and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third-parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. marketing activities. The increases in 2018, compared to 2017, and in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily reflect the impact of higher benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes. 

Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses, decreased by $221 million in 2018, compared to the prior year (2017: $404 million decrease versus 2016). The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, is primarily due to asset sales and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher production taxes in the Bakken. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to lower workover expenses, lease operating and employee costs, partially offset by higher production taxes in the Bakken. Operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense in 2018 increased, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and water disposal activity in 2018, partially offset by lower costs from our former business in the Permian. Tariffs expense in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees in 2017. For 2019, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $750 million to $775 million.  

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs decreased by $988 million in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of assets which had higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average, a lower DD&A rate at the Bakken due to year-end 2017 proved reserve additions, and the impact of prior year asset impairments. DD&A costs decreased by $377 million in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average DD&A rate due to the production mix. 

Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Forecast information excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. 

(b)  

Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings and Libya, cash operating costs per boe for 2018 were $13.32 (2017: $14.56; 2016: $15.45).  

(c)  

Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings and Libya, DD&A per boe for 2018 were $18.29 (2017: $25.29; 2016: $26.48). 

30 

Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

In 2018, we recorded dry hole costs associated with the Aspy well, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada, the Pontoenoe-1 well, offshore Suriname, and the Sorubim-1 well on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2017, we recorded dry hole costs associated with our former interests in Ghana. In 2016, we recorded dry hole costs associated with our former interests in Australia and three exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Exploration expenses were lower in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to lower dry hole expense and lower geologic and seismic costs. Exploration expenses were lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower dry hole expense, leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. See items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below. For 2019, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. 

Income Taxes: The E&P income tax provision was an expense of $391 million in 2018 (2017: $1,842 million benefit; 2016: $1,587 million expense). Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the E&P income tax provision was an expense of $391 million in 2018 (2017: $95 million expense; 2016: $948 million benefit). The provision in 2018 compared to 2017, and 2017 compared to 2016, reflects higher production from Libya and lower deferred tax benefits on losses. Commencing in 2017, we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia and Guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. See E&P items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes beginning on page 39. 

Actual and forecast effective tax rates are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. 

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

31 

The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income are as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2018: 

•  

Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio and a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Ghana. 

•  

Exit costs and other: We incurred noncash pre-tax charges of $73 million ($73 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax severance charge of $37 million ($37 million after income taxes), related to a cost reduction program undertaken to reflect the reduced scale of our business following significant asset sales in 2017. 

2017: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Impairment: We recorded a noncash impairment charge related to our interests in Norway totaling $2,503 million pre-tax ($550 million after income taxes) in the third quarter prior to the sale of our interests in the fourth quarter. In addition, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily because of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. See Note 13, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

•  

Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $280 million ($280 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of our interest at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license, offshore Ghana (Hess 50% license interest) as a result of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2017 to not develop the previously discovered fields. These costs were incurred in periods prior to 2017. 

•  

Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. The de-designation was a result of production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter. 

2016: 

•  

Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $938 million ($693 million after income taxes) to write-off all previously capitalized wells and other project related costs for our Equus natural gas project, offshore the North West Shelf of Australia, following the decision to defer further development of the project. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $83 million ($52 million after income taxes) to write-off the previously capitalized Sicily-1 exploration well based on our decision not to pursue the project. These costs were incurred in periods prior to 2016. 

32 

•  

Gains on asset sale, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($17 million after income taxes) related to the sale of undeveloped onshore acreage in the U.S. 

•  

Income taxes:  We recorded a non-cash charge of $2,920 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge had no impact on the Corporation’s cash flows or its underlying tax positions. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $51 million related to the resolution of certain international tax matters. 

•  

Offshore rig cost: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $105 million ($66 million after income taxes) related to an offshore drilling rig. 

•  

Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($19 million after income taxes) to write off surplus materials and supplies inventory. 

•  

Exit costs and other: We recorded exit and other costs of $26 million ($17 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance as part of a cost reduction program. 

Midstream 

Following is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations, which include results for a gas plant and associated CO2 assets in the Permian Basin (through August 2017) and water handling services in North Dakota that are wholly-owned by Hess: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

The provision for income taxes in the Midstream segment in 2018 and 2017 is presented before consolidating its operations with other U.S. activities of the Company and prior to evaluating realizability of net U.S. deferred taxes. An offsetting impact is presented in the E&P segment. 

(b)  

The partnership is not subject to tax and, therefore, the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income is a pre-tax amount. 

Sales and other operating revenues in 2018 increased, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and water disposal activity in 2018, partially offset by prior year activity associated with our former Permian assets that were sold in August 2017. Sales and other operating revenues in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees earned, and higher tariff rates and throughput volumes, partially offset by lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. 

Operating costs and expenses in 2018 reflect increased activity related to produced water disposal services and lower costs from our former Permian assets versus the prior year. Operating costs and expenses were lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower third-party rail charges and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. DD&A expenses were higher in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to pipeline assets that were brought into service in the current year. 

The increase in interest expense in 2018, compared to 2017, and 2017, compared to 2016, reflects higher borrowings by Hess Infrastructure Partners LP. 

For 2019, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.  

33 

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: We recognized a pre-tax loss of $57 million ($34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) in 2017 related to the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. Midstream results in 2016 included a pre-tax charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars.  

Corporate, Interest and Other 

The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were lower in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to lower employee related costs, non-service pension costs and legal fees. Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher legal costs, increased pension settlement charges in 2017, and the recognition of a nonrecurring gain of $8 million in 2016. In 2019, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million.  

Interest expense was lower in 2018, compared to 2017, due to lower average borrowings. Capitalized interest was lower in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the Stampede Field commencing production in January 2018. Interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to slightly higher average borrowings. Capitalized interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, due to increased activity at the Hess operated Stampede development project and sanction of the Liza Field Phase 1 development project during 2017. In 2019 after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $315 million to $325 million. 

Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the benefit for income taxes is lower in 2018 and 2017, compared to 2016, due to us generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in the U.S. while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. This accounting treatment commenced on December 31, 2016. See items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes beginning on page 39. 

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 

2018: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $58 million ($58 million after income taxes) resulting from the settlement of legal claims related to former downstream interests. 

•  

Income tax:  We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax benefit of $91 million to offset the recognition of a noncash income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income resulting primarily from changes in fair value of our 2019 crude oil hedging program, as required under accounting standards. 

2017: 

•  

Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($30 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space, of which $11 million is included in General and administrative expenses and $19 million is included in Depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 

34 

2016: 

•  

Income tax:  We recorded a non-cash charge of $829 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge had no impact on the Corporation’s cash flows or its underlying tax positions. 

•  

Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $148 million ($92 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase and redemption of notes to complete a debt refinancing. 

•  

Exit costs and other: We recorded exit and other costs of $3 million ($2 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Includes $109 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment, at December 31, 2018 (2017: $356 million). 

(b)  

Includes $981 million of debt outstanding from HIP at December 31, 2018 (2017: $980 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 

(c)  

Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. 

Cash Flows 

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities: In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities increased, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower production volumes largely due to asset sales. In 2017, operating cash flows increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower production volumes. 

Changes in working capital in 2018 reduced cash by $186 million (2017: $780 million reduction; 2016: $47 million reduction), primarily from premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures. Changes in working capital in 2017 included increased accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices, abandonment expenditures, premiums on crude oil hedge contracts, pension contributions, contract termination payments for an offshore drilling rig, and crude oil delivered as line fill. 

Investing Activities: Total addition to property, plant and equipment were $2,097 million in 2018 (2017: $1,937 million; 2016: $2,251 million). The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2018, compared to 2017, is primarily related to increased expenditures in the Bakken, offshore Guyana, offshore Canada and in our Midstream segment, primarily offset by the impact of prior year asset sales and reduced development expenditure in both the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia. In 2017, Additions to property, plant and equipment were lower, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower development expenditures at North Malay Basin, partially offset by increased investments in Bakken and Guyana in 2017. In 2018, Midstream equity investments in its 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources were $67 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets of $607 million in 2018 (2017: $3,296 million; 2016: $140 million) include the divestiture of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio, and our share of proceeds from the sale and lease-back transaction of the North Malay Basin floating storage and offloading vessel. 

Financing Activities: Repayments of debt were $633 million in 2018 (2017: $459 million; 2016: $1,455 million) while borrowings of debt with maturities in excess of 90 days were $800 million in 2017 and $1,496 million in 2016. We settled common stock purchases in the amount of $1,365 million in 2018 (2017: $110 million). Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $345 million in 2018 (2017: $363 million; 2016: $350 million). In 2017, Hess Midstream Partners LP received  

35 

proceeds of $365.5 million from the issuance of common units in an initial public offering, of which $350 million was distributed equally to Hess Corporation and GIP. Net outflows to noncontrolling interests were $211 million in 2018 (2017: $243 million net outflow; 2016: $23 million net outflow). In 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for total net proceeds of $1.64 billion.  

Future Capital Requirements and Resources 

At December 31, 2018, Hess Corporation, had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $7.0 billion. The Corporation has no significant near-term debt maturities. We have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 95,000 bopd. 

Net production in 2019 is forecast to be in the range of 270,000 boepd to 280,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2019 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.9 billion. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2019, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2018, will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends through the end of 2019. 

The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2018: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

In January 2020, the capacity reduces to $3.7 billion. 

(b)  

Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates throughout 2019. 

(c)  

This credit facility may only be utilized by HIP and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 

(d)  

This credit facility may only be utilized by Hess Midstream Partners LP and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 

The Corporation’s $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expires in January 2021, with commitments of $3.7 billion available for the final year. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. The facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60% of the Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2018, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant.  

We had $284 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2018 (2017: $246 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 21, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. 

At December 31, 2018, HIP has $800 million of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing November 2022, consisting of a $600 million 5-year revolving credit facility and a drawn $200 million 5-year Term Loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on HIP’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If HIP obtains an investment grade credit rating, as defined in the amended credit agreement, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time  

36 

to time. The credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to cash interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for so long as the facilities remain secured. HIP is in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2018. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2018, HIP’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and borrowings under the Term Loan A facility amounted to $197.5 million, excluding deferred issuance costs. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of HIP’s and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. 

Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”) has a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility that became available for utilization at completion of its initial public offering in April 2017. The credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the Partnership and expires March 2021. Borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.275%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the Partnership’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to EBITDA. If the Partnership obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The Partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement, including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including equity interests in subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exclusions. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2018, this facility was undrawn. 

Credit Ratings 

Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating. At December 31, 2018, we have investment grade credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB-). Moody’s Investors Service has rated our debt at Ba1. The consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements, which are not material. 

At December 31, 2018, HIP’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service, and BB by Fitch Ratings. 

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 

The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2018: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

We anticipate cash payments for interest of $401 million for 2019, $775 million for 2020-2021, $752 million for 2022-2023, and $3,912 million thereafter for a total of $5,840 million. These interest payments reflect our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018. 

(b)  

On January 1, 2019, we will adopt ASC 842, Leases, which will result in operating lease commitments greater than one year being reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 

(c)  

Comprises obligations where we, as operator, have contracted directly with suppliers. 

Capital expenditures represent amounts that we were contractually committed at December 31, 2018, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2019. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, support vessels, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. 

37 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At December 31, 2018, we had $284 million in letters of credit. See also Note 19, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Foreign Operations 

We conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand and Malaysia, Denmark, Libya, Guyana, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption, and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. 

Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. 

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. 

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. 

For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. 

Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2019 are at levels below that used in determining 2018 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2019 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2019 above those used in determining 2018 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2019, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2019 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2019 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 would result in an approximate $200 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2019 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 82 through 92 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. 

38 

Midstream Joint Venture:  We consolidate the activities of our 50/50 joint venture HIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. 

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.  

Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. While crude oil prices in 2018 were higher than the last few years, we could experience an asset impairment in the future if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. 

Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We conduct the goodwill test at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from several factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. At December 31, 2018, our Midstream operating segment had goodwill of $360 million that resulted from an allocation from our E&P segment upon the formation of the Midstream segment in 2015. Our E&P segment has no goodwill at December 31, 2018. 

To determine whether an indicator of impairment exists, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  

Fair value for the Midstream operating segment is based on a market approach, whereby the market capitalization of Hess Midstream Partners, LP’s (the Partnership), which represents an approximate 20% economic interest in the operating companies that comprise the Midstream segment, is adjusted to an amount equal to a 100% economic interest in the operating companies based on the Partnership’s stock price at the time of the impairment test. Other adjustments made to compute fair value include estimating the fair value of other minor Midstream assets not owned by the Partnership and long-term debt held directly by HIP. 

Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. 

We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized.  

39 

The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position at December 31, 2018. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia, and Guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. 

At December 31, 2018, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $4,877 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth.  

Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations. 

Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to: 

Discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations: The discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2018, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $100 million and forecasted 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately $5 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligation would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolio. 

Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2018, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately $5 million.  

Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality level. 

40 

Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. 

Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. 

We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. 

We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.  

Environment, Health and Safety 

Our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. 

We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. 

We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. 

We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2018, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $15 million in 2018 (2017: $15 million; 2016: $10 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
