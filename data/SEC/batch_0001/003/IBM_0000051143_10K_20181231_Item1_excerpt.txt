PART I 

 Item 1. Business:  

 International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues todaythe company creates value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.  

  IBM Strategy  

 IBM's strategy is wholly focused on the needs of its clients. IBM is a technology company, but first and foremost it is an enterprise company. IBM serves enterprises of all sizes, and IBM's longest-standing clients are leaders in their industriesthe world's leading financial services institutions, airlines, manufacturers, consumer goods and retail companies. IBM's mission is to help its clients transform their companies and lead in their industries.  

 One of the biggest priorities for IBM clients is to derive competitive advantage through insights and the latest digital technologies. Better insight about the wants and needs of their customers will help them distinguish themselves in the marketplace. Data-driven insight will also influence how they design and produce their own products, as well as help them identify opportunities in new markets.  

 However, most companies are harnessing only a small percent of the valuable data they collect. As IBM clients embark on the next chapter of their digital journey, the proper collection, use, safeguarding and management of data is of paramount importance. Choosing the right digital technologies to analyze the data is also necessary.  

 IBM helps clients harness the power of their data through technologies like AI, analytics and blockchain; on a hybrid cloud that connects data across traditional and new environments; with services that put a client's data and insight to use in and for their business. Underpinning all of this, IBM safeguards client data with world-class technologies and approaches to security.  

 By reinventing themselves digitally around insight, clients become what IBM calls Cognitive Enterprises.  

  What IBM Brings to Clients  

 Businesses are choosing IBM because they want to partner with a company that can uniquely integrate three core capabilities:    

1.They want the most innovative technology, like AI, blockchain, cybersecurity and quantum delivered in a hybrid cloud environment. 

2.They want industry expertisefrom a partner that deeply understands their industry and can apply innovation to their business processes to drive transformation and competitive advantage.   

1 

3.And, finally, they want a total commitment to trust and security. Clients want to partner with a company that will protect their valuable data and insights, and one that develops and deploys new innovations with a commitment to do so responsibly.   

 IBM is unique in that it can integrate all three core capabilities for clients.  

  Innovative Technology  

 IBM has a long history of bringing innovative technology to the world. For 26 years, IBM has led the world in U.S. patents; six IBMers are Nobel Laureates; and IBM engineers have developed innumerable first-of-its-kind products and services. Current examples of IBM's innovative technology include:   

 Analytics and AI: IBM's long-standing leadership in managing and extracting insights from data starts with a portfolio of analytics and database offerings. A few years ago, IBM brought AI into the mainstream with the Watson platform, which to date has been the foundation of many Enterprise AI implementations in production. Recently, IBM augmented its Watson platform with a set of AI tools that enable clients to trace the origins of the data their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has not crept into results. These innovations are making AI more consumable by everyday usersnot just data scientists.  

 Security: Businesses built around data require an unparalleled level of data security. IBM is the leader in information security for enterpriseswith leadership in both security software and services. Security is embedded inside all of IBM's products and services. For example, IBM Z offers pervasive security by building data encryption directly in its computing processor. In addition, IBM's Services businesses are world class in embedding security into the solutions they build and run for IBM clients.   

 Blockchain is an exciting technology that is just beginning to transform business processes. IBM's platform has been rated number one by leading analyst firms such as Juniper Research and Everest Group. Blockchain technology enables multiple parties to conduct business with each other on a single, unified distributed system, eliminating the costly and time-consuming hand-offs of fragmented systems. IBM is deploying blockchain technology with clients to transform how global trade is transacted, how food safety is tracked and how supply chains are managed.  

 Cloud: Enterprise clients are in the very early stages of the move to cloud. IBM estimates that only 20 percent of workloads have moved to the cloudwith work ahead for the remaining 80 percent. The first part was to move business workloads that exist as a layer over core processes. The hard part is ahead: moving the mission-critical systems that run banking, retail, telecom and other industries. Some of these workloads will remain in traditional IT systems, some will move to a private cloud inside the safety of a client's firewall, others will move to public clouds, and some will surge between all of these. Wherever a workload may reside, it will need to share its data across environments. All of this requires an approach that is open, highly interoperable between environments, and even interoperable between different public clouds. This is what IBM has long called hybrid cloudand this describes the solution for the 80 percent of the workloads that is to come. With in-depth experience across all three environments, IBM brings the strongest hybrid cloud solution to the market for enterpriseswhich will be strengthened through the acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat).   

  Industry Expertise  

 Changing a business requires in-depth understanding of how a business works and how technology can make it work differently.  

2 

 IBM brings both industry expertise and innovative technology to clients through the IBM services and products businesses. This combination makes IBM unique and essential.  

 A few examples of this capability are highlighted below:   

 Global Business Services: the IBM GBS business is one of the world's largest professional services businesses. Its mission is to help clients along the journey to becoming a Cognitive Enterprise.  

 Global Technology Services: the IBM GTS business runs some of the world's largest data centersand thereby some of the world's most mission-critical workflows and franchises. GTS helps clients along their journey to the hybrid cloudleveraging the best of their existing systems in the context of the regulatory, security and workflow of their industry.  

 Industry and Domain-Specific Solutions: augmenting IBM's services businesses are software and solutions designed for specific industries and domains. For example:     

Health: IBM has become a leader in applying advanced digital technologies to healthcare, including the application of AI and data analytics to the diagnosis and treatment of patients, bringing smart decisions to Health Care payers, and helping Life Sciences companies develop innovative products and services.  

Financial Services: IBM is a leading provider in the Financial Services industry; with IBM's Promontory Financial Group, a leading advisor in Financial Regulation and Compliance, IBM offers an advanced set of solutions for managing Risk and Compliance, a critical workflow in the Financial Services industry.    

  Trust and Security  

 Data and AItogether, they are both the opportunity and the issue of current times. They can make the world a better, healthier and more productive place; but only if businesses and consumers trust the companies putting data and AI to work.  

 IBM is a 107-year old businessand the reason it has been successful for so long is because it has earned the trust of its clients. IBM has not only followed guidelines around the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology, but created them, published them, and invited others to adopt similar commitments. IBM's principles make clear that:   

 The purpose of new technologies is to augmentnot replacehuman expertise;  

 Data and insights derived from AI belong to their owners and creators (not their IT partners); and,  

 New technologies must be transparent and explainable.   

 There are many companies in the IT industry who bring technology products to the marketplace. Many bring technology services to the marketplace. A few companies do both, but no one can do it as well as IBM when it comes to meeting the needs of clients. By bringing together technology and workflow, combining it with industry expertise, innovation and deployment, IBM helps clients and industries truly transform themselves.  

 This is what truly sets IBM apart.  

  Business Model  

 The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing together innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through  

3 

strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.  

 The company's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide integrated solutions and platforms to the company's clients.  

 The business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including the company's transformation into cloud and as-a-Service delivery models. The company continues to strengthen its position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas, broadening its industry expertise and integrating AI into more of what the company offers. In addition, the company is transforming into a more agile enterprise to drive innovation and speed, as well as helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity. The company also regularly evaluates its portfolio and proactively maximizes shareholder value of non-strategic assets by bringing products to end of life, engaging in IP partnerships or executing divestitures.  

 This business model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term.

  Research, Development and Intellectual Property  

 IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately 7 percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and mid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, security, cloud, nanotechnology, silicon and post-silicon computing architectures and moreapplying these technologies across industries including financial services, healthcare, blockchain and IoT.  

 In 2018, for the 26th consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM's 9,100 patents awarded in 2018 represent a diverse range of inventions in strategic growth areas for the company, including more than 3,000 patents related to work in artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and quantum computing.  

 The company actively continues to seek IP protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the company licenses certain of its intellectual property assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This generates IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products.  

  Competition  

 The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive environment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide.  

 Across its business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the company's innovation leadership into the future.

 Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted.  

 The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives under Its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, agile processes and changes to the way the company works, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.  

 Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.  

 Damage to IBM's Reputation Could Impact the Company's Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. IBM's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers and talent could be impacted.  

 Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, and emerging business models, IBM's costs may increase or the client demand for our products or services may decline.  

 IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the  

12 

company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.  

 Certain of the Company's offerings incorporate open source software licensed without warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections. If the code is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to the software, including modifications to address security vulnerabilities, which could impact IBM's ability to market its products, mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill its contractual obligations to customers.  

 Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company's Business: In the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, and other third parties to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. The company's products, services and systems, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services and systems are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks, breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. To date, while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate security incidents, including those associated with cybersecurity attacks, there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity attack that has a material adverse effect in the future. As the company's business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. In the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company and its customers, and may not be detected or remediated for some time afterward, particularly if additional steps are required to implement remediation-related updates. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in  

13 

disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.  

 As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. As the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and an increased number of data protection laws around the globe could continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks as a result of (i) increased regulatory enforcement of GDPR and other data protection rules and (ii) the trend of shifting and sharing data processing responsibilities from companies having direct relationship with consumers to all companies in the data processing chain. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market.  

 The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict.  

 Due to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. For example, the U.K. referendum to exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as "Brexit", has caused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. The company is actively monitoring and planning for Brexit.  

14 

 The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position.  

 Tax Matters Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.  

 The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.  

 Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.  

 The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP)  

15 

requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, under "Critical Accounting Estimates." In addition, as discussed in note M, "Contingencies and Commitments," in IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.  

 The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.  

 The Company's Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.  

 Product Quality Issues Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results.  

 The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations, financial results and reputation.  

 The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's financing business  

16 

are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.  

 The Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.  

 The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.  

 Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions, including the proposed Red Hat acquisition, present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. The company plans to fund the Red Hat transaction with a combination of cash and debt financing. Any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.  

 The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks  

17 

associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note M, "Contingencies and Commitments," in IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.  

 Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors." There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.  

 The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.  

 In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.
