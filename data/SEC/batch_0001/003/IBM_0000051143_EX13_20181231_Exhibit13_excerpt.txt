Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

OVERVIEW 

The financial section of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) 2018 Annual Report includes the Management Discussion, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This Overview is designed to provide the reader with some perspective regarding the information contained in the financial section. 

Organization of Information 

· The Management Discussion is designed to provide readers with an overview of the business and a narrative on the companys financial results and certain factors that may affect its future prospects from the perspective of the companys management. The Management Discussion Snapshot, beginning on page 19, presents an overview of the key performance drivers in 2018. 

· Beginning with the Year in Review on page 27, the Management Discussion contains the results of operations for each reportable segment of the business and a discussion of the companys financial position and cash flows. Other key sections within the Management Discussion include: Looking Forward on page 59, and Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 60, which includes a description of managements definition and use of free cash flow. 

· The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on pages 70 through 75. These statements provide an overview of the companys income and cash flow performance and its financial position. 

· The Notes follow the Consolidated Financial Statements. Among other items, the Notes contain the companys accounting policies (pages 76 to 88), acquisitions and divestitures (pages 91 to 94), certain contingencies and commitments (pages 115 to 117), revenue (pages 120 to 122) and retirement-related plans information (pages 127 to 141). 

· The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). 

· On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) was enacted in the U.S. This Act resulted in the company recording a charge of $5.5 billion in the fourth-quarter 2017. For the full-year 2018, the company recorded additional charges of $2.0 billion, including $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the election to include Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in measuring deferred taxes. Refer to note N, Taxes, on pages 117 to 119 for additional information. 

· Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on presentation of net periodic pension and nonpension postretirement benefit costs (net benefit cost). The guidance is primarily a change in financial statement presentation, but it did impact the consolidated and reportable segment gross profit margins and expense and other income. As a result, the company aligned its presentation of operating (non-GAAP) earnings to conform to the FASB presentation of these costs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The periods presented in this Annual Report are reported on a comparable basis. 

· The references to adjusted for currency or at constant currency in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When the company refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusts such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year periods currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. See Currency Rate Fluctuations on page 66 for additional information. 

· Within the financial statements and tables in this Annual Report, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages reported are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar numbers. 

Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings 

In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, the company separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs, discontinued operations and related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the company characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and all 2018 adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections, any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges. For the 2019 operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share expectation, acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat) acquisition exclude pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are dependent on the size, type and frequency of the companys acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion and Analysis, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. The company includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan

assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business. 

Overall, the company believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the companys pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The companys reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the companys management and measurement system.

In 2018, the company reported $79.6 billion in revenue and $8.7 billion in income from continuing operations, which included charges of $2.0 billion associated with U.S. tax reform. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $12.7 billion, which excludes the tax reform charges. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $9.51 as reported and $13.81 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $15.2 billion in cash from operations, $11.9 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $10.1 billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 

Total consolidated revenue in 2018 increased 0.6 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Cognitive Solutions increased 0.2 percent as reported and was essentially flat adjusted for currency. Solutions Software grew 0.8 percent as reported (essentially flat adjusted for currency), while Transaction Processing Software declined 1.2 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency). Global Business Services (GBS) increased 2.9 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency led by growth in Consulting. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms (TS&CP) grew 0.5 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency, with growth in Infrastructure Services and Integration Software offset by declines in Technical Support Services. Within TS&CP, there was continued strong growth in cloud revenue which increased 23 percent year to year as reported and adjusted for currency. Systems decreased 2 percent as reported and adjusted for currency, with IBM Z declining year to year reflecting product cycle dynamics. Storage Systems also decreased in a competitive environment with ongoing pricing pressures, while Power Systems grew as reported and adjusted for currency, with strong performance in Power9-based processors and Linux throughout the year. 

In 2018, the company delivered solid strategic imperatives revenue growth, generating $39.8 billion of revenue and growing 9 percent as reported and adjusted for currency, with double-digit growth in cloud and security. Cloud revenue of $19.2 billion increased 12 percent as reported and adjusted for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 22 percent as reported and adjusted for currency. The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $12.2 billion in 2018 compared to $10.3 billion in 2017. 

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 1.7 percent year to year as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) with a decline in the U.S. of 2.4 percent. Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 4.5 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific was essentially flat year to year as reported and adjusted for currency. 

The consolidated gross margin of 46.4 percent decreased 0.3 points year to year and reflects the impacts of portfolio mix and investment, partially offset by benefits from productivity and improving services margins through the year. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 46.9 percent decreased 0.4 points versus the prior year primarily driven by the same factors.

Total expense and other (income) increased 0.2 percent in 2018 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by decline in intellectual property (IP) income (2 points) and a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges (1 point), offset by continued focus on efficiency resulting in lower spending (3 points). Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 0.4 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $11.3 billion decreased 0.5 percent and the pre-tax margin was 14.3 percent, a decrease of 0.2 points versus 2017. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.1 percent, including charges of $2.0 billion associated with U.S. tax reform. This is compared to an effective tax rate of 49.5 percent in 2017 which included a $5.5 billion charge associated with U.S. tax reform. Without these impacts, the continuing operations tax rate for 2018 would have been 5.4 percent, compared to a 2017 rate of 1.5 percent. Net income of $8.7 billion increased 51.7 percent year to year as a result of the lower tax reform charges in 2018. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $13.7 billion was flat year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 0.1 points to 17.3 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $12.7 billion decreased 1.2 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 15.9 percent, down 0.3 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2018 was 7.9 percent, compared to 6.8 percent in the prior year. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.51 in 2018 increased 54.9 percent year to year, which included lower year-to-year charges associated with U.S. tax reform. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $13.81 increased 1.1 percent versus 2017. In 2018, the company repurchased 32.9 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $4.4 billion and had $3.3 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at December 31, 2018. 

At December 31, 2018, the balance sheet remains strong and the company continues to be committed to maintaining a strong investment grade rating. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2018 were $12.2 billion, a decrease of $0.6 billion from December 31, 2017. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows were: 

Total assets decreased $2.0 billion (increased $1.2 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2017 driven by: 

· A decline in receivables of $1.6 billion ($0.6 billion adjusted for currency) driven by a decline in trade receivables of $1.5 billion, and 

· A decrease in net intangibles and goodwill of $1.2 billion ($0.6 billion adjusted for currency) resulting from currency impacts and intangibles amortization; partially offset by 

· An increase in deferred costs of $1.0 billion ($1.2 billion adjusted for currency) driven primarily by capitalized sales commissions costs due to the adoption of the new revenue standard. 

Total liabilities decreased $1.2 billion (increased $1.3 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2017 driven by: 

· Decreases in total debt ($1.0 billion), deferred income ($0.7 billion) and compensation and benefits ($0.5 billion); partially offset by 

· Increases in taxes ($1.1 billion). 

Total equity of $16.9 billion decreased $0.8 billion from December 31, 2017 as a result of: 

· Decreases from dividends ($5.7 billion) and treasury stock ($4.6 billion) primarily due to share repurchases; partially offset by 

· Increases from net income ($8.7 billion) and the transition adjustment related to the adoption of the new revenue standard ($0.6 billion). 

The company generated $15.2 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $1.5 billion compared to 2017, driven primarily by a decrease in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.8 billion), a decrease in cash sourced from sales cycle working capital ($0.2 billion) and an increase in cash income tax payments ($0.1 billion). Net cash used in investing activities of $4.9 billion was $2.2 billion lower than the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in cash used for net non-operating receivables ($1.5 billion) and lower net purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($0.5 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $10.5 billion increased $4.1 billion compared to 2017, driven primarily by a decrease in net cash sourced from debt transactions ($3.7 billion), with a lower level of issuances and a higher level of maturities in the current year. 

In January 2019, the company disclosed that it is expecting GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $12.45 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.90 per diluted share for 2019. The company expects free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2019. Free cash flow realization is expected to be approximately 100 percent of GAAP net income. Refer to page 61 in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on this non-GAAP measure. Refer to the Looking Forward section on pages 59 and 60 for additional information on the companys expectations.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Please refer to IBMs Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019 for Item 1A. entitled Risk Factors. 

The company creates value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the worlds leading research organizations. 

IBM Strategy 

IBMs strategy is wholly focused on the needs of its clients. IBM is a technology company, but first and foremost it is an enterprise company. IBM serves enterprises of all sizes, and IBMs longest-standing clients are leaders in their industries  the worlds leading financial services institutions, airlines, manufacturers, consumer goods and retail companies. IBMs mission is to help its clients transform their companies and lead in their industries. 

One of the biggest priorities for IBM clients is to derive competitive advantage through insights and the latest digital technologies. Better insight about the wants and needs of their customers will help them distinguish themselves in the marketplace. Data-driven insight will also influence how they design and produce their own products, as well as help them identify opportunities in new markets. 

However, most companies are harnessing only a small percent of the valuable data they collect. As IBM clients embark on the next chapter of their digital journey, the proper collection, use, safeguarding and management of data is of paramount importance. Choosing the right digital technologies to analyze the data is also necessary. 

IBM helps clients harness the power of their data through technologies like AI, analytics and blockchain; on a hybrid cloud that connects data across traditional and new environments; with services that put a clients data and insight to use in and for their business. Underpinning all of this, IBM safeguards client data with world-class technologies and approaches to security. 

By reinventing themselves digitally around insight, clients become what IBM calls Cognitive Enterprises. 

What IBM Brings to Clients 

Businesses are choosing IBM because they want to partner with a company that can uniquely integrate three core capabilities: 

1. They want the most innovative technology, like AI, blockchain, cybersecurity and quantum delivered in a hybrid cloud environment. 

2. They want industry expertise  from a partner that deeply understands their industry and can apply innovation to their business processes to drive transformation and competitive advantage. 

3. And, finally, they want a total commitment to trust and security. Clients want to partner with a company that will protect their valuable data and insights, and one that develops and deploys new innovations with a commitment to do so responsibly. 

IBM is unique in that it can integrate all three core capabilities for clients. 

Innovative Technology 

IBM has a long history of bringing innovative technology to the world. For 26 years, IBM has led the world in U.S. patents; six IBMers are Nobel Laureates; and IBM engineers have developed innumerable first-of-its-kind products and services. Current examples of IBMs innovative technology include: 

· Analytics and AI: IBMs long-standing leadership in managing and extracting insights from data starts with a portfolio of analytics and database offerings. A few years ago, IBM brought AI into the mainstream with the Watson platform, which to date has been the foundation of many Enterprise AI implementations in production. Recently, IBM augmented its Watson platform with a set of AI tools that enable clients to trace the origins of the data their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has not crept into results. These innovations are making AI more consumable by everyday users  not just data scientists. 

· Security: Businesses built around data require an unparalleled level of data security. IBM is the leader in information security for enterprises  with leadership in both security software and services. Security is embedded inside all of IBMs products and services. For example, IBM Z offers pervasive security by building data encryption directly in its computing processor. In addition, IBMs Services businesses are world class in embedding security into the solutions they build and run for IBM clients. 

· Blockchain is an exciting technology that is just beginning to transform business processes. IBMs platform has been rated number one by leading analyst firms such as Juniper Research and Everest Group. Blockchain technology enables multiple parties to conduct business with each other on a single, unified distributed system, eliminating the costly and time-consuming hand-offs of fragmented systems. IBM is deploying blockchain technology with clients to transform how global trade is transacted, how food safety is tracked and how supply chains are managed.

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

· Cloud: Enterprise clients are in the very early stages of the move to cloud. IBM estimates that only 20 percent of workloads have moved to the cloud  with work ahead for the remaining 80 percent. The first part was to move business workloads that exist as a layer over core processes. The hard part is ahead: moving the mission-critical systems that run banking, retail, telecom and other industries. Some of these workloads will remain in traditional IT systems, some will move to a private cloud inside the safety of a clients firewall, others will move to public clouds, and some will surge between all of these. Wherever a workload may reside, it will need to share its data across environments. All of this requires an approach that is open, highly interoperable between environments, and even interoperable between different public clouds. This is what IBM has long called hybrid cloud  and this describes the solution for the 80 percent of the workloads that is to come. With in-depth experience across all three environments, IBM brings the strongest hybrid cloud solution to the market for enterprises  which will be strengthened through the acquisition of Red Hat. 

Industry Expertise 

Changing a business requires in-depth understanding of how a business works and how technology can make it work differently. 

IBM brings both industry expertise and innovative technology to clients through the IBM services and products businesses. This combination makes IBM unique and essential. 

A few examples of this capability are highlighted below: 

· Global Business Services: the IBM GBS business is one of the worlds largest professional services businesses. Its mission is to help clients along the journey to becoming a Cognitive Enterprise. 

· Global Technology Services: the IBM GTS business runs some of the worlds largest data centers  and thereby some of the worlds most mission-critical workflows and franchises. GTS helps clients along their journey to the hybrid cloud  leveraging the best of their existing systems in the context of the regulatory, security and workflow of their industry. 

· Industry and Domain-Specific Solutions: augmenting IBMs services businesses are software and solutions designed for specific industries and domains. For example: 

Health: IBM has become a leader in applying advanced digital technologies to healthcare, including the application of AI and data analytics to the diagnosis and treatment of patients, bringing smart decisions to Health Care payers, and helping Life Sciences companies develop innovative products and services. 

Financial Services: IBM is a leading provider in the Financial Services industry; with IBMs Promontory Financial Group, a leading advisor in Financial Regulation and Compliance, IBM offers an advanced set of solutions for managing Risk and Compliance, a critical workflow in the Financial Services industry. 

Trust and Security 

Data and AI  together, they are both the opportunity and the issue of current times. They can make the world a better, healthier and more productive place; but only if businesses and consumers trust the companies putting data and AI to work. 

IBM is a 107-year old business  and the reason it has been successful for so long is because it has earned the trust of its clients. IBM has not only followed guidelines around the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology, but created them, published them, and invited others to adopt similar commitments. IBMs principles make clear that: 

· The purpose of new technologies is to augment  not replace  human expertise; 

· Data and insights derived from AI belong to their owners and creators (not their IT partners); and, 

· New technologies must be transparent and explainable. 

There are many companies in the IT industry who bring technology products to the marketplace. Many bring technology services to the marketplace. A few companies do both, but no one can do it as well as IBM when it comes to meeting the needs of clients. By bringing together technology and workflow, combining it with industry expertise, innovation and deployment, IBM helps clients and industries truly transform themselves. 

This is what truly sets IBM apart. 

Business Model 

The companys business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing together innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. 

The companys global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide integrated solutions and platforms to the companys clients. 

The business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including the companys transformation into cloud and as-a-Service delivery models. The company continues to strengthen its position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas, broadening its industry expertise and integrating AI into more of what the company offers. In addition, the company is transforming into a more agile enterprise to drive innovation and speed, as well as helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant

long-term opportunity. The company also regularly evaluates its portfolio and proactively maximizes shareholder value of non-strategic assets by bringing products to end of life, engaging in IP partnerships or executing divestitures. 

This business model, supported by the companys financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term.

Global Financing encompasses two primary businesses: financing, primarily conducted through IBM Credit LLC (IBM Credit), and remanufacturing and remarketing. IBM Credit is a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM that accesses the capital markets directly. IBM Credit, through its financing solutions, facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services in the areas where the company has expertise. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end users business operations. The company conducts a comprehensive credit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Global Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also maintains a long-term partnership with the companys clients through various stages of the IT asset life cycle  from initial purchase and technology upgrades to asset disposition decisions. 

Global Financing Capabilities 

Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven years. Assets financed are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where the company has expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Technology Services & Cloud Platforms long-term client service contracts. All internal financing arrangements are at arms-length rates and are based upon market conditions. 

Commercial Financing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers of IBM and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products and services. The OEM portion will begin winding down starting in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the calendar year. Commercial Financing also includes internal activity where Global Financing factors a selected portion of the companys accounts receivable primarily for cash management purposes, at arms-length rates.

Remanufacturing and Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be refurbished or upgraded, and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally or internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. Systems may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients. 

IBM Worldwide Organizations 

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBMs delivery of value to its clients: 

· Global Markets 

· Research, Development and Intellectual Property 

Global Markets 

IBM has a global presence, operating in more than 175 countries with a broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. The companys Global Markets organization manages IBMs global footprint, working closely with dedicated country-based operating units to serve clients locally. These country teams have client relationship managers who lead integrated teams of consultants, solution specialists and delivery professionals to enable clients growth and innovation. 

By complementing local expertise with global experience and digital capabilities, IBM builds deep and broad-based client relationships. This local management focus fosters speed in supporting clients, addressing new markets and making investments in emerging opportunities. The Global Markets organization serves clients with expertise in their industry as well as through the products and services that IBM and partners supply. IBM continues to expand its reach to new and existing clients through digital marketplaces, digital sales and local Business Partner resources. 

Research, Development and Intellectual Property 

IBMs research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately 7 percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the companys business units through global labs on near-term and mid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to IBMs portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, security, cloud, nanotechnology, silicon and post-silicon computing architectures and more  applying these technologies across industries including financial services, healthcare, blockchain and IoT. 

In 2018, for the 26th consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBMs 9,100 patents awarded in 2018 represent a diverse range of inventions in strategic growth areas for the company, including more than 3,000 patents related to work in artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and quantum computing. 

The company actively continues to seek IP protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership. Some of IBMs technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the company licenses certain of its intellectual property assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This generates IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the companys various proprietary IP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products.

Services Backlog and Signings 

($ in billions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The estimated total services backlog at December 31, 2018 was $116 billion, a decrease of 4.1 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency). 

Total services backlog includes Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and Technical Support Services (TSS). Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either noncancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency. 

Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a services contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. 

Signings include Infrastructure Services, Consulting, GPS and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. TSS is generally not included in signings as the maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings. 

Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Systems revenue of $8,034 million decreased 2.0 percent year to year as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) driven by strong IBM Z performance in the prior year and continuing price pressures impacting Storage Systems. Both hardware platforms were down year to year for the full year, as reported and adjusted for currency. This performance was partially offset by strong growth in Power Systems (which grew as reported and adjusted for currency in 2018). Systems Hardware revenue of $6,363 million declined 2.0 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency). Operating Systems Software revenue of $1,671 million decreased 1.7 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.

Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue decreased 5.4 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by the strong performance in 2017 of the z14 mainframe which was launched in the third quarter of 2017. The z14 continues to be one of the most successful programs within IBM Z history, and the company continued to grow the install base by adding new clients and new mission-critical workloads to the platform. 

Power Systems revenue increased 8.8 percent as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. As reported and adjusted for currency, there was double-digit revenue growth in both the low-end and high-end portfolio, mitigated by a decline in the midrange products. Overall performance was driven by Linux and continued strong adoption of the new POWER9-based architecture. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the business released the next-generation POWER9 processors in the high-end. These systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. In 2018, the company delivered the most powerful commercially available supercomputers built with Power9 technology to the U.S. Department of Energy labs. 

Storage Systems revenue decreased 5.5 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, with declines in midrange products, mitigated by continued strong growth in flash array offerings. The storage market remains very competitive, with ongoing pricing pressures. The company continues to introduce new innovative products with enhanced functionality into its products, such as the extension of the next-generation NVMe technology into its midrange products in December 2018. This technology is expected to be extended across the storage portfolio in the first half of 2019. 

Within Systems, total strategic imperatives revenue of $4.5 billion grew 4 percent year to year as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $3.1 billion declined 10 percent as reported and adjusted for currency, reflecting IBM Z product cycle dynamics.

The Systems gross profit margin decreased 3.4 points to 49.8 percent in 2018 compared to the prior year. The overall decrease year to year was driven by the mix away from IBM Z and margin declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems. 

Pre-tax income of $904 million declined 19.9 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 2.4 points year to year to 10.2 percent driven by the strong performance in IBM Z in the prior year, and the continued investment in innovation across the Systems portfolio. 

Global Financing 

Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.

In 2018, Global Financing delivered external revenue of $1,590 million and total revenue of $3,200 million, with an increase in gross margin of 1.0 points. Total pre-tax income of $1,361 million increased 6.5 percent compared to 2017 and return on equity decreased 2.0 points to 30.8 percent. 

In 2018, Global Financing total revenue increased 1.0 percent compared to the prior year. This was due to an increase in internal revenue of 9.5 percent, driven by an increase in internal financing (up 17.6 percent to $424 million), and an increase in internal used equipment sales (up 6.8 percent to $1,187 million). External revenue declined 6.3 percent due to a decrease in external used equipment sales (down 30.8 percent to $366 million), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 4.9 percent to $1,223 million). 

The increase in external financing revenue was due to the increase in the average asset balances, partially offset by lower asset yields. The increase in internal financing revenue was primarily due to higher asset yields and average asset balances. 

Total sales of used equipment represented 48.5 percent and 51.8 percent of Global Financings revenue for years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease in 2018 was due to lower volume of external used equipment sales, partially offset by increases in internal transactions. The gross profit margin on used sales was 54.2 percent and 47.4 percent for years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in the gross profit margin was driven by a shift toward higher margin internal equipment sales. 

Global Financing pre-tax income increased 6.5 percent year to year primarily driven by an increase in gross profit ($52 million) and a decrease in total expense ($32 million). 

The decrease in return on equity from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to lower net income. Refer to page 40 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculations. 

Total unguaranteed residual value of leases, including operating leases, at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $699 million and $724 million, respectively. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. 

Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $231 million and $716 million for the financing transactions originated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In 2018, the residual value guarantee program resulted in the company recognizing approximately $148 million of revenue that would otherwise have been recognized in future periods as operating lease revenue. If the company had chosen to not participate in a residual value guarantee program in 2018 and prior years, the 2018 impact would be substantially mitigated by the effect of prior year asset values being recognized as operating lease revenue in the current year. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of direct financing leases were $163 million and $154 million for the financing transactions originated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $18 million and $45 million for the financing transactions originated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation 

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost of $510 million decreased $24 million compared to 2017. This was due primarily to decreases related to the conversion of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($4 million), performance share units ($7 million) and restricted stock units ($13 million). Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories: Cost: $82 million, down $9 million; SG&A expense: $361 million, down $23 million; and RD&E expense: $67 million, up $8 million.

Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $209 million compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($296 million), an increase in other costs ($93 million) related to benefits from pension litigation in the prior year and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($70 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($235 million). 

As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on pages 18 and 19, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2018 were $1,494 million, a decrease of $22 million compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plans cost ($22 million). Non-operating costs of $1,572 million increased $232 million in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($296 million), an increase in other costs ($93 million) related to benefits from pension litigation in the prior year and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($70 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($235 million). 

Income Taxes 

The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2018 was 23.1 percent, a decrease of 26.4 points versus the prior year. In 2018, the accounting for impacts of U.S. tax reform was completed and the effects of measurement period adjustments were recognized as a net full-year 2018 charge of $2.0 billion (17.7 points). This is compared to a charge of $5.5 billion (48.0 points) in 2017 related to the impact of the enactment of U.S. tax reform, a year-to-year decrease of 30.4 points. Without these impacts, the continuing operations tax rate for 2018 would have been 5.4 percent, compared to a 2017 rate of 1.5 percent. The adjusted year-to-year increase of 3.9 points is primarily driven by the following factors: 

· A lower benefit year to year in the utilization of foreign tax credits of 5.9 points; 

· Benefits in 2017 related to an intra-entity asset transfer of 5.1 points and the tax write down of an investment of 1.7 points; 

· A year-to-year increase in tax charges related to intercompany payments of 1.3 points; partially offset by 

· Benefits in 2018 related to domestic and foreign audit activity (6.8 points), geographic mix of pre-tax earnings in 2018 (2.1 points) and the re-assessment of valuation allowances (1.2 points). 

The continuing operations operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was 7.9 percent in 2018, an increase of 1.1 points versus 2017, principally driven by the same factors described above.

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* Includes a charge of $2.0 billion or $2.23 of diluted earnings per share in 2018 and $5.5 billion or $5.84 of diluted earnings per share in 2017 associated with U.S. tax reform. 

**Recast to reflect adoption of the FASB guidance on presentation of net benefit cost. 

Actual shares outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 892.5 million and 922.2 million, respectively. The average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution was 21.1 million shares lower in 2018 versus 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program. 

Financial Position 

Dynamics 

At December 31, 2018, the company continued to have the financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $12,222 million. During the year, the company continued to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. 

Total debt of $45,812 million decreased $1,012 million from prior year-end levels. The commercial paper balance at December 31, 2018, was $2,995 million, an increase of $1,499 million from the prior year end. Within total debt, $31,227 million is in support of the Global Financing business which is leveraged at a 9 to 1 ratio. The company continues to have substantial flexibility in the debt markets. During 2018, the company completed bond issuances totaling $4,000 million, with terms ranging from 2 to 5 years, and interest rates ranging from 2.65 to 3.60 percent depending on maturity. The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its Credit Facilities. 

Consistent with accounting standards, the company remeasured the funded status of its retirement and postretirement plans at December 31. At December 31, 2018, the overall net underfunded position was $13,133 million, an increase of $243 million from December 31, 2017 driven by lower asset returns, partially offset by lower interest cost and an increase in discount rates. At year end, the companys qualified defined benefit plans were well funded and the cash requirements related to these plans is expected to be approximately $400 million in 2019 and in the $350 million to $400 million range in 2020. In 2018, the return on the U.S. Personal Pension Plan assets was (1.8) percent and the plan was 104 percent funded at December 31. Overall, global asset returns were (1.9) percent and the qualified defined benefit plans worldwide were 99 percent funded at December 31, 2018. 

During 2018, the company generated $15,247 million in cash from operations, a decrease of $1,477 million compared to 2017. In addition, the company generated $11,876 million in free cash flow, a decrease of $1,117 million versus the prior year. See page 61 for additional information on free cash flow. The company returned $10,109 million to shareholders in 2018, with $5,666 million in dividends and $4,443 million in gross share repurchases. In 2018, the company repurchased 32.9 million shares and had $3.3 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization at year end. The companys cash generation permits the company to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.

At December 31, 2018, substantially all financing assets were IT-related assets, and approximately 55 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers. This investment-grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio. Additionally, the company takes actions to transfer exposure to third parties. On that basis, the investment-grade content would increase by 16 points to 71 percent, a slight increase year to year. 

The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. 

IBM Working Capital 

($ in millions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Working capital decreased $1,454 million from the year-end 2017 position. The key changes are described below: 

Current assets decreased $590 million (increased $1,009 million adjusted for currency) due to: 

· A decline in receivables of $1,067 million ($261 million adjusted for currency) driven by a decline in trade receivables of $1,496 million; partially offset by 

· An increase of $519 million ($598 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the reclassification of certain trade receivables due to the adoption of the new revenue standard. 

Current liabilities increased $865 million ($2,076 million adjusted for currency) as a result of: 

· An increase in short-term debt of $3,220 million ($3,284 million adjusted for currency) primarily as a result of reclassifications of $7,252 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities and an increase in commercial paper of $1,499 million; partially offset by maturities of $5,586 million. The increase in short-term debt was partially offset by 

· A decrease in taxes payable of $1,173 million ($1,099 million adjusted for currency) principally driven by the resolution in the first-quarter 2018 of certain matters related to the ongoing U.S. tax audit of the companys 2013-2014 tax returns; and 

· A decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $569 million driven by currency-related decreases of $502 million; and 

· A decrease in deferred income of $387 million ($44 million adjusted for currency).

Global Financings bad debt expense was $14 million in 2018, compared to $17 million in 2017. The year-to-year decrease in bad debt expense was primarily due to lower specific reserve requirements in 2018. 

Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities 

($ in millions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in noncurrent assets of $1,385 million (an increase of $177 million adjusted for currency) was driven by: 

· A decrease in net intangibles and goodwill of $1,178 million resulting from intangibles amortization and currency impacts of $553 million. 

Long-term debt decreased $4,232 million ($3,994 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by: 

· Reclassifications to short-term debt of $7,252 million to reflect upcoming maturities; and 

· Early retirement of long-term debt of $942 million; partially offset by 

· Issuances of $4,673 million. 

Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased $2,189 million ($3,236 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by: 

· An increase in other liabilities of $2,209 million, primarily driven by the companys election to include GILTI in measuring deferred taxes ($1,927 million). 

Debt 

The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed. 

($ in millions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for TS&CP, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these TS&CP assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. 

Non-Global Financing debt of $14,585 million declined $805 million from prior year-end levels. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. 

Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 33 and in note U, Segment Information, on pages 141 to 146. In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.

Fourth-quarter operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $4.4 billion, which excludes the tax charge. Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.15 and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.87. The company generated $4.1 billion in cash from operations and $6.5 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2018 and delivered shareholder returns of $3.5 billion through gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 

In the fourth quarter, revenue decreased 3.5 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Cognitive Solutions was flat as reported, but grew 2 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in Solutions Software, 1 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency, led by analytics and AI offerings. Transaction Processing Software decreased 1 percent year to year as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency reflecting strong transactional performance in the quarter. GBS increased 4.1 percent as reported, and 6 percent adjusted for currency, led by Consulting. There was growth across all GBS lines of business as reported and adjusted for currency as the company focuses on clients digital transformation. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms decreased 2.9 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. Infrastructure Services declined year to year as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. There was strong growth in signings reflecting demand for hybrid cloud implementations and productivity solutions. Within TS&CP, Integration Software grew year to year driven by continued strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private and improved transactional volumes. Systems decreased 21.3 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting the impact of the IBM Z product cycle dynamics. Growth in Power Systems, as reported and adjusted for currency was more than offset by declines in IBM Z and Storage Systems. 

The company continued to deliver solid strategic imperatives revenue growth, generating $11.5 billion of revenue and growing 3 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency. Strategic imperatives revenue growth was impacted by the IBM Z cycle. Excluding IBM Z, strategic imperatives growth would have been 9 percent as reported and 11 percent adjusted for currency. There was strong growth across analytics, cloud and security, excluding IBM Z. Total Cloud revenue of $5.7 billion increased 3 percent as reported and 6 percent adjusted for currency, and was also impacted by the IBM Z cycle. Total Cloud revenue growth, excluding IBM Z, would have been 15 percent as reported and 19 percent adjusted for currency. Cloud-as-a-Service revenue was up 18 percent (21 percent adjusted for currency) and the annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $12.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $11.4 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Analytics revenue of $6.4 billion increased 6 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency).

Total expense and other (income) decreased 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. The year-to-year decrease was driven by the effects of currency (4 points) and lower spending (3 points), partially offset by lower intellectual property income (2 points). The expense dynamics reflect the companys focus on driving productivity in the business and new ways of working including using agile methodologies, leveraging automation and infusing AI into its processes. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 5.2 percent year to year driven primarily by the same factors.

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

Cognitive Solutions gross profit margin of 79.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 was essentially flat compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $2,437 million increased 7.2 percent compared to the prior year. The pre-tax margin grew 2.9 points, to 40.3 percent driven by operating leverage from growth in revenue, operational efficiencies and a mix toward software, with continued investment in key strategic areas. 

Global Business Services 

Global Business Services revenue of $4,322 million increased 4.1 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year with growth as reported and adjusted for currency across all three lines of business. GBS performance reflects the repositioning of this business and the value clients recognize when combining the companys technology and industry expertise as they integrate their digital initiatives and internal process transformation. 

Consulting revenue of $2,008 million increased 7.5 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency). The growth during the fourth quarter was led by the companys digital strategy and next generation Enterprise Applications.

Application Management revenue of $1,989 million increased 1.1 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). This return to growth was driven by strong performance in Cloud Migration Factory and cloud application development, while traditional application management engagements declined as clients continue to migrate to the cloud. The growth also reflects the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts. 

GBS strategic imperatives revenue of $2.9 billion grew 11 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion grew 30 percent as reported (34 percent adjusted for currency), with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $2.1 billion.

Infrastructure Services revenue of $5,819 million declined 2.9 percent as reported (flat adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. As the company prioritizes the offerings within its portfolio, it is moving away from certain lower-value offerings, which will impact revenue performance in the near term, but will improve margin growth in the longer term. Technical Support Services revenue of $1,722 million decreased 6.4 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by the dynamics of the Systems hardware product cycle. Integration Software revenue of $1,387 million increased 1.8 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. There was continued strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, an innovative platform that assists clients in modernizing their traditional workloads and improved transactional performance in the quarter.

Operating Systems Software revenue of $446 million decreased 4.4 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. 

Within Systems Hardware, fourth-quarter IBM Z revenue declined 45.2 percent as reported (44 percent adjusted for currency) year to year as a result of the IBM Z product cycle and strong demand for z14 in the prior year. Since launching the z14 six quarters ago, this platform continues to track ahead of prior programs, and the install base grew as new clients and new workloads continued to be added to the platform. Over 55 percent of installed MIPs inventory is in emerging workload areas.

Power Systems revenue grew 8.6 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency) year to year driven by Linux and continued strong performance of the new POWER9-based processors. The low-end and high-end portfolios had double-digit growth in the quarter. The release of the next generation POWER9 processor was completed during the quarter, with HANA certification extended to high-end processors. Power Systems are designed for handling advanced analytics and data-intensive workloads in cloud environments within AI, HANA and UNIX markets. 

Storage Systems revenue decreased 8.0 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) with declines in midrange, and the market remains very competitive with price pressure. There was double-digit growth (as reported and adjusted for currency) in high-end hardware products and in all-flash array offerings. 

Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $1.6 billion declined 23 percent year to year as reported (22 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 32 percent as reported (31 percent adjusted for currency). Both reflected IBM Z product cycle dynamics. 

The Systems gross profit margin decreased 4.9 points to 50.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. The overall decrease year to year was driven primarily by product cycle dynamics with a mix away from IBM Z and margin declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems, partially offset by Operating Systems Software margin improvement. In the fourth quarter of 2018, pre-tax income of $551 million declined 39.2 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 6.5 points year to year to 19.3 percent driven by the strong fourth-quarter 2017 performance in Systems Hardware. The company continues to develop next-generation technology and deliver new innovative functionality across its Systems portfolio. 

Global Financing 

Global Financing revenue of $402 million decreased 10.7 percent year to year. Global Financing fourth-quarter pre-tax income decreased 27.9 percent to $319 million and the pre-tax margin of 41.3 percent decreased 3.1 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was driven by a decrease in gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense and financing receivable provisions. 

Geographic Revenue 

Total revenue of $21,760 million decreased 3.5 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Americas revenue of $10,222 million decreased 5.3 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. EMEA fourth-quarter revenue of $7,081 million decreased 1.3 percent as reported, but increased 2 percent adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific revenue of $4,458 million declined 2.7 percent and 1 percent adjusted for currency. 

Within Americas, revenue in the U.S. decreased 7.0 percent year to year, driven primarily by the strong IBM Z performance in the prior year. Canada decreased 4.1 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. Latin America increased 4.8 percent as reported and 17 percent adjusted for currency. Within Latin America, Brazil increased 8.1 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency. Mexico increased 12.6 percent as reported and 16 percent adjusted for currency. 

In the fourth quarter, EMEA revenue performance by country varied. The UK decreased 0.9 percent as reported, but increased 3 percent adjusted for currency.

Cash Flow 

The company generated $4.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $1.6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decline from financing receivables. Net cash sourced from investing activities of $0.5 billion was $4.3 billion higher than the prior years net use of cash, primarily driven by an increase in cash from net proceeds from disposition of marketable securities and other investments ($2.3 billion) and an increase from net non-operating financing receivables ($1.6 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $4.6 billion increased $3.7 billion compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher net debt maturities ($2.3 billion) and higher gross common stock repurchases ($1.4 billion).

Snapshot 

In 2017, the company reported $79.1 billion in revenue and $5.8 billion in income from continuing operations, which included a charge of $5.5 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $12.8 billion, which excluded the tax reform charge. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $6.14 as reported and $13.66 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $16.7 billion in cash from operations, $13.0 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $9.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 

Total consolidated revenue in 2017 decreased 1.0 percent as reported and 1 percent year to year adjusted for currency. The company returned to revenue growth in the fourth quarter with an increase of 3.6 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Year-to-year revenue performance improved sequentially in the second half of 2017 compared to first-half performance. Contributors to the second-half improvement included: momentum in cloud and as-a-Service offerings, strong Systems growth across IBM Z, Power Systems and Storage Systems, improved software transactional performance and improved growth in Consulting. 

Cognitive Solutions increased 1.5 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency with growth in Solutions Software and Transaction Processing Software as reported and adjusted for currency. Solutions Software performance included growth in annuity revenue, led by as-a-Service solutions. Global Business Services decreased 2.1 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency with declines across all lines of business. GBS strategic imperatives revenue increased 10 percent as reported and adjusted for currency year to year as the business shifted resources and moved into the high-value strategic areas of digital, cloud and analytics. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms decreased 3.0 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency, primarily driven by a decline in Infrastructure Services. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms strategic imperatives revenue was up 19 percent as reported and 18 percent adjusted for currency year to year, driven by hybrid cloud services, security and mobile. Systems increased 6.2 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency driven by strong contribution from the z14 mainframe in the second half of 2017 and growth in Storage Systems. 

The company continued to deliver solid growth in its strategic imperatives which generated $36.5 billion of revenue and grew 11 percent as reported and adjusted for currency. Total Cloud revenue of $17.0 billion increased 24 percent as reported and adjusted for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 31 percent as reported and adjusted for currency. The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $10.3 billion in 2017 compared to $8.6 billion in 2016. Analytics revenue of $20.6 billion increased 6 percent as reported and adjusted for currency. Mobile increased 19 percent as reported and adjusted for currency and Security increased 55 percent (54 percent adjusted for currency). 

The consolidated gross margin of 46.7 percent decreased 1.5 points year to year and reflected investments and mix, partially offset by benefits from productivity. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 47.2 percent decreased 1.6 points versus the prior year primarily driven by the same factors. 

Total expense and other (income) decreased 2.5 percent in 2017 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year decrease was primarily the result of continued focus on efficiency in spending and reduced expenses for workforce transformation. This included a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges (3 points), lower operational spending (3 points) and a 2016 charge for real estate actions (1 point). The year-to-year decrease in total expense and other (income) was partially offset by higher retirement-related costs (3 points), spending related to acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months (1 point) and a decline in IP income (1 point). Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 6.2 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors, excluding the impact of higher non-operational retirement related costs. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $11.4 billion decreased 7.5 percent and the pre-tax margin was 14.4 percent, a decrease of 1.0 points versus 2016. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2017 was 49.5 percent, which included a charge of $5.5 billion from the enactment of U.S. tax reform in December 2017, compared to 3.6 percent in 2016. The charge encompassed several elements, including taxes on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The low tax rate in 2016 was primarily the result of a refund ($1.0 billion) of previously paid Japan taxes plus interest. Income from continuing operations of $5.8 billion decreased 51.5 percent, impacted by the tax reform charge, and the net income margin was 7.3 percent, a decrease of 7.6 points versus 2016. Net income of $5.8 billion decreased 51.5 percent

year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $13.7 billion decreased 0.3 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations was 17.4 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $12.8 billion decreased 0.6 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 16.2 percent, essentially flat year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2017 was 6.8 percent, which included the effect of discrete tax benefits in the first and second quarters of 2017. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.14 in 2017, which included the one-time charge associated with U.S. tax reform, decreased 50.4 percent year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $13.66 increased 1.6 percent versus 2016. In 2017, the company repurchased 27.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $4.3 billion. 

At December 31, 2017, the balance sheet remained strong and well positioned to support the business over the long term. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2017 were $12.8 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion from December 31, 2016. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows were: 

Total assets increased $7.9 billion ($3.0 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2016 driven by: 

· Increases in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities ($4.1 billion), total receivables ($2.9 billion), retirement plan assets ($1.6 billion) and goodwill ($0.6 billion); partially offset by 

· Decreases in intangible assets ($0.9 billion). 

Total liabilities increased $8.6 billion ($4.0 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2016 driven by: 

· Increases in total debt ($4.7 billion) and taxes ($3.5 billion). 

Total equity of $17.7 billion decreased $0.7 billion from December 31, 2016 as a result of: 

· Decreases from dividends ($5.5 billion) and share repurchases ($4.3 billion); partially offset by 

· Increases from net income ($5.8 billion), retirement-related benefit plans ($2.3 billion) and equity translation adjustments ($0.8 billion). 

The company generated $16.7 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $0.4 billion compared to 2016, driven primarily by performance-related declines within net income and an increase in cash tax payments, partially offset by an increase in cash provided by receivables. Net cash used in investing activities of $7.1 billion was $3.8 billion lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions ($5.2 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $6.4 billion increased $0.5 billion compared to 2016, driven primarily by increased gross common share repurchases ($0.8 billion).

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue decreased in 2017 compared to the prior year, with declines across all lines of business. The revenue decline in Infrastructure Services reflected the impact of contract conclusions at the end of 2016 and the shift away from lower value work within the business. While Technical Support Services also declined year to year, the company focused on growing its multi-vendor support services providing clients a single source of expertise across different vendor solutions. Within Integration Software, although the annuity base remained relatively stable year to year in 2017, transactional revenue declined as the portfolio shifted to the IBM Cloud. Strategic imperatives revenue of $10.4 billion grew 19 percent year to year as reported (18 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $7.1 billion grew 21 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency), with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $6.9 billion.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The year-to-year growth in Systems revenue was driven by a combination of strong z14 market acceptance following its successful launch in the third quarter of 2017 and growth in Storage Systems. In 2017, all-flash array offerings were a catalyst for Storage Systems growth, with strong double-digit growth throughout the year. Power Systems revenue decreased with declines in the mid-range and low-range products, partially offset by growth in the high-end. This performance reflected the companys shift to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high-value, but declining UNIX market. Total strategic imperatives revenue of $4.3 billion grew 28 percent year to year as reported (26 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $3.4 billion grew 26 percent as reported (25 percent adjusted for currency).

The Systems gross profit margin decrease was driven by margin declines across all product lines, partially offset by product mix primarily toward higher margin IBM Z, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Pre-tax income growth was driven by the strong performance in Systems Hardware. Overall 2017 performance reflected a successful repositioning of the business through continuous reinvention of core platforms and expansion into new workloads. 

Global Financing

The decline in Global Financing total revenue was driven by a decline in internal revenue with external revenue essentially flat compared to the prior year. External revenue grew 0.3 percent due to an increase in external used equipment sales (up 14.9 percent), partially offset by a decline in external financing (down 5.2 percent). The decline in internal revenue of 18.4 percent was driven by a decrease in internal used equipment sales (down 25.2 percent), partially offset by an increase in internal financing (up 13.9 percent). The decrease in Global Financing pre-tax income was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit, partially offset by a decline in financing receivables provisions.

Total consolidated other (income) and expense was expense of $1,125 million in 2017 compared to $593 million in 2016. The increase in expense of $532 million year over year was primarily driven by: 

· Higher retirement-related costs ($893 million); and

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense decreased $15 million compared to 2016. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2017 was $1,273 million, an increase of $67 million year to year, primarily driven by higher average interest rates. 

Income Taxes 

The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2017 was 49.5 percent, an increase of 45.8 points versus the prior year. The fourth-quarter 2017 charge of $5.5 billion related to the impact of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in an increase to the effective tax rate of 48.0 points. Without this impact, the continuing operations tax rate would have been 1.5 percent compared to a 2016 rate of 3.6 percent, with the remaining change in the rate year to year driven by the following factors: 

· An increased benefit year to year in the utilization of foreign tax credits of 5.4 points; 

· A benefit related to an intra-entity asset transfer in the first quarter of 2017 of 5.1 points; 

· A benefit due to the tax write down of an investment in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 1.7 points; and 

· A benefit due to the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings in 2017 of 1.0 points; partially offset by 

· The favorable resolution of the longstanding tax matter in Japan in 2016 of 9.5 points; and 

· An increase year to year in tax charges related to intercompany payments of 1.5 points. 

The continuing operations operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was 6.8 percent, an increase of 0.2 points versus 2016, principally driven by the same factors described above. In 2017, the geographic and product mix of pre-tax earnings were more favorable than the company expected and there was increased utilization of foreign tax credits. These impacts drove the underlying continuing operations operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate to approximately 12 percent before discrete period benefits. 

Financial Position 

Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2017 were $12,842 million. During 2017, the company continued to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. 

Total debt of $46,824 million increased $4,655 million from prior year-end levels. The commercial paper balance at December 31, 2017, was $1,496 million, an increase of $597 million from the prior year end. Within total debt, $31,434 million was in support of the Global Financing business which was leveraged at a 9.0 to 1 ratio. During 2017, the company completed bond issuances totaling $7,986 million, with terms ranging from 2 to 12 years, and interest rates ranging from 0.95 to 3.30 percent depending on maturity. This included IBM Credits first public debt issuance of $3,000 million in September 2017. The company generated strong cash flow from operations and continued to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its Credit Facilities. 

Consistent with accounting standards, the company remeasured the funded status of its retirement and postretirement plans at December 31. At December 31, 2017, the overall net under-funded position was $12,890 million, a decrease of $1,949 million from December 31, 2016 driven by asset returns, partially

offset by interest cost and a decrease in discount rates. The companys qualified defined benefit plans were well funded and the cash requirements related to these plans remain stable going forward at approximately $400 million per year through 2020. In 2017, the return on the U.S. Personal Pension Plan assets was 9.6 percent and the plan was 104 percent funded at December 31. Overall, global asset returns were 8.3 percent and the qualified defined benefit plans worldwide were 100 percent funded at December 31, 2017. 

During 2017, the company generated $16,724 million in cash from operations, a decrease of $360 million compared to 2016. In addition, the company generated $12,992 million in free cash flow, an increase of $1,293 million versus the prior year. The company returned $9,847 million to shareholders in 2017, with $5,506 million in dividends and $4,340 million in gross share repurchases. In 2017, the company repurchased 27.2 million shares.

OTHER INFORMATION 

Looking Forward 

The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy. 

As part of its long-term strategic model, the company expects to continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively to investments, and to return value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Over the long term, in consideration of the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company continues to expect to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value business mix, mid single-digit profit growth, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization of GAAP net income over 90 percent. 

Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the companys innovation leadership into the future. The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars  innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model. 

IBMs proposed acquisition of Red Hat will bring together the best-in-class hybrid cloud providers and will enable companies to securely unlock the full value of cloud for their businesses. IBM and Red Hat will be strongly positioned to address this opportunity and accelerate hybrid cloud adoption. The company is proceeding through the regulatory process and expects to close the transaction in the second half of 2019. The acquisition of Red Hat reinforces IBMs high-value model. It is expected to accelerate IBMs revenue growth, gross margin and be accretive to free cash flow within 12 months of closing. The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and supporting a solid and growing dividend. The company will target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating. In order to reduce debt, the company intends to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021. 

At mid-January 2019 spot rates, the company expects a 4 point currency headwind to first quarter 2019 revenue growth, which is approximately two points worse than the year-to-year impact realized in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company expects 1 to 2 point sequential improvement in revenue growth at constant currency from the fourth quarter 2018 to the first quarter 2019. For full-year 2019, the company expects to expand gross and pre-tax margins. 

Overall, the company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2019 to be at least $12.45. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.91 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $0.45 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.09 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.90. For the first quarter of 2019, the company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be approximately 16 percent of the respective full-year expectations. In January 2019, the company announced the intent to divest certain software products and its mortgage-servicing business during the year. The estimates of the impacts from these divestitures are not dependent on timing of closing and have been included in the full-year earnings per share expectations. However, earnings per share expectations do not include Red Hat, as financial implications for 2019 are heavily dependent on the timing of the closing. Expectations will be updated after the transaction closes. 

The company expects free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2019. Free cash flow expectations for the year reflect expected operational profit performance and continued working capital efficiency, partially offset by a cash tax headwind. Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be approximately 100 percent for the year. These expectations also take into account the estimated impact of the announced divestitures of the select IBM software products and mortgage servicing business and an estimate of pre-closing financing costs associated with the Red Hat acquisition. 

For full-year 2019, the company expects the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14 percent, excluding discrete items. The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 11 to 12 percent (which is a 3 to 4 points headwind year to year), including an estimate of potential discrete items. The rates will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. The GAAP effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, audit adjustments, among others. 

Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBMs Global Financing business will begin winding down the portion of its commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships. The wind down of this activity is expected to reduce IBMs revenue, with a nominal impact to profit, however it does not change the companys earnings per share and free cash flow expectations for 2019. 

Beginning in 2019, within the IBM U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan, substantially all the plan participants are now considered inactive, which, as required by U.S. GAAP, results in a change in the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses, from the average remaining service period of active plan participants to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants. These periods are approximately 6 years and 

59 

Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

18 years, respectively. As a result of this change, there will be a reduction to 2019 amortization expense of approximately $900 million. Actuarial loss amortization is reported within non-operating pension costs. There will be no impact to 2019 operating (non-GAAP) retirement-related costs, funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan. However, there will be an impact to free cash flow realization in 2019. 

The company expects 2019 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2018. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2018. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower actuarial loss amortization resulting from the change in amortization period for the U.S. plan. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2019, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2018. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $15.2 billion and $17.1 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2016 through 2018. 

Cash Flow and Liquidity Trends 

($ in billions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* Recast to reflect adoption of the FASB guidance on restricted cash. 

On October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire all the outstanding shares of Red Hat. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearance. The company intends to fund this transaction through a combination of cash and debt. In connection with this acquisition, IBM entered into a commitment letter under which certain banks committed to provide the company with a 364-day unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20 billion to fund the acquisition. 

The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at December 31, 2018 appear in the table below. As a result of the proposed Red Hat transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Standard and Poors lowered IBM and IBM Credits long-term debt rating to A from A+, with no change to the short-term debt rating of A-1, and Fitch Ratings has lowered IBM and IBM Credits long-term debt rating to A from A+, with no change to the short-term debt rating of F1. Moodys placed IBM and IBM Credits long-term debt rating of A1 under review for downgrade, with no change to the short-term debt rating of Prime-1. IBM will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. 

The companys indenture governing its debt securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of the companys consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the companys ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on the companys consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 

The company is in compliance with all of its significant debt covenants and provides periodic certification to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable. 

The company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $383 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

The company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 73 and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 40. For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.

Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. 

From the perspective of how management views cash flow, in 2018, after investing $3.7 billion in capital investments primarily in support of the services and cloud-based businesses, the company generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, declines in sales cycle working capital and an increase in cash income tax payments. 

In 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $5.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in gross common stock repurchases (32.9 million shares). 

Over the past three years, the company generated over $36 billion in free cash flow. During that period, the company invested over $6 billion in strategic acquisitions and returned over $28 billion to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases. The companys performance during this period demonstrates that there is fungibility across the elements of share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions. The amount of prospective returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases will vary based upon several factors including each years operating results, capital expenditure requirements, research and development investments and acquisitions, as well as the factors discussed on page 62. As a result of the proposed transaction to acquire Red Hat, subject to closing, the company intends to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021. 

The companys Board of Directors considers the dividend payment on a quarterly basis. In the second quarter of 2018, the Board of Directors increased the companys quarterly common stock dividend from $1.50 to $1.57 per share. 

The table below represents the way in which management reviews cash flow as described above.

Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note M, Contingencies and Commitments, on pages 115 to 117. With respect to pension funding, in 2018, the company contributed $363 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans compared to $409 million in 2017. As highlighted in the Contractual Obligations table, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1.8 billion in the next five years. The 2019 contributions are currently expected to be approximately $400 million. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2019, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2018. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations. 

In 2019, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. 

The companys cash flows are sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, the company has several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing its committed global credit facilities. 

Contractual Obligations

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  *   As funded status on plans will vary, obligations for mandated minimum pension payments after 2023 could not be reasonably estimated.   

  **    These amounts represent the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The company estimates that approximately $551 million of the liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. The settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the income tax liability cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing of the payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities; however, it is not expected to be due within the next 12 months.

Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

Total contractual obligations are reported in the previous table excluding the effects of time value and therefore, may not equal the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Certain noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the previous table as their future cash outflows are uncertain. This includes deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred income, disability benefits and other sundry items. Certain obligations related to the companys divestitures are included. 

Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) the company would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) the company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services (take-or-pay). If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the previous table. If the obligation is cancelable, but the company would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation. Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment. 

In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contracts that specify that the company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product, commodity or service from a supplier or vendor. These contracts are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms. They do not specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and, therefore, the company does not consider them to be purchase obligations. 

Interest on floating-rate debt obligations is calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2018, plus the interest rate spread associated with that debt, if any. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

From time to time, the company may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67), Disclosure in Managements Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations. 

At December 31, 2018, the company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on the companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See the table on page 62 for the companys contractual obligations, and note M, Contingencies and Commitments, on pages 115 to 117, for detailed information about the companys guarantees, financial commitments and indemnification arrangements. The company does not have retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or other material off-balance sheet interests or instruments. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The application of GAAP requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of the companys Board of Directors. The companys significant accounting policies are described in note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 76 to 88. 

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, etc.) are included to allow users of the Annual Report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managements predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. 

Pension Assumptions 

For the companys defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of the benefit obligation to plan participants and net periodic pension (income)/cost requires the use of certain assumptions, including, among others, estimates of discount rates and expected return on plan assets. 

Changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the (gain)/loss amortization and interest cost components of the net periodic pension (income)/cost calculation and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The company increased the discount rate assumption for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (PPP), a U.S.-based defined benefit plan, by 70 basis points to 4.10 percent on December 31, 2018. This change will decrease pre-tax income recognized in 2019 by an estimated $17 million. If the discount rate assumption for the PPP had decreased by 70 basis points on December 31, 2018, pre-tax income recognized in 2019 would have increased by an estimated $50 million. Further changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact the companys funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the PPPs PBO of an estimated $1.1 billion based upon December 31, 2018 data. 

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is used in calculating the net periodic pension (income)/cost. Expected returns on plan assets are calculated based on the market-related value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term return on plan assets 

63 

Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

are recognized over five years in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost and also as a component of actuarial (gains)/losses, which are recognized over the service lives or life expectancy of the participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed thresholds which are based upon the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets, as provided by accounting standards. 

To the extent the outlook for long-term returns changes such that management changes its expected long-term return on plan assets assumption, each 50 basis point increase or decrease in the expected long-term return on PPP plan assets assumption would have an estimated decrease or increase, respectively, of $248 million on the following years pre-tax net periodic pension (income)/cost (based upon the PPPs plan assets at December 31, 2018 and assuming no contributions are made in 2019). 

The company may voluntarily make contributions or be required, by law, to make contributions to its pension plans. Actual results that differ from the estimates may result in more or less future company funding into the pension plans than is planned by management. Impacts of these types of changes on the companys pension plans in other countries worldwide would vary depending upon the status of each respective plan. 

In addition to the above, the company evaluates other pension assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age and mortality, and updates these assumptions to reflect experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year can differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. 

For additional information on the companys pension plans and the development of these assumptions, see note T, Retirement-Related Benefits, on pages 127 to 141. 

Revenue Recognition 

Application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations. Other significant judgments include determining whether IBM or a reseller is acting as the principal in a transaction and whether separate contracts should be combined and considered part of one arrangement. 

Revenue recognition is also impacted by the companys ability to determine when a contract is probable of collection and to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties, and performance bonuses. The company considers various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. If the estimates were changed by 10 percent in 2018, the impact on net income would have been immaterial. 

Costs to Complete Service Contracts 

The company enters into numerous service contracts through its services businesses. During the contractual period, revenue, cost and profits may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate profitability of each contract, especially contracts for which the company uses cost-to-cost measures of progress (i.e. percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting). If at any time these estimates indicate the POC contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost. The company performs ongoing profitability analyses of its POC-based services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed by the company to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. Contract loss provisions recorded as a component of other accrued expenses and liabilities were $24 million and $25 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Income Taxes 

The company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes. 

During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are supportable, the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. The company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions, and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that new information becomes available which causes the company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. 

Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that the company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, the company will adjust its valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. 

The consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. 

64 

Management Discussion 

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 

To the extent that the provision for income taxes increases/ decreases by 1 percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes, consolidated net income would have decreased/improved by $113 million in 2018. 

Valuation of Assets 

The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired including separately identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. The companys estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of managements assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. 

Valuation of Goodwill 

The company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. In 2018, the company assessed the qualitative risk factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 

The company assesses qualitative factors in each of its reporting units that carry goodwill including relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of reporting units. Examples include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, as well as other individual factors such as: 

· A loss of key personnel; 

· A significant adverse shift in the operating environment of the reporting unit such as unanticipated competition; 

· A significant pending litigation; 

· A more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; and 

· An adverse action or assessment by a regulator. 

The company assesses these qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. After performing the annual goodwill impairment qualitative analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company determined it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. 

Loss Contingencies 

The company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, the company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation, and may revise its estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial position. 

Global Financing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Global Financing business reviews its financing receivables portfolio on a regular basis in order to assess collectibility and records adjustments to the allowance for credit losses at least quarterly. A description of the methods used by management to estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 76 to 88. Factors that could result in actual receivable losses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the economic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in Global Financings receivables portfolio. 

To the extent that actual collectibility differs from managements estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, Global Financings segment pre-tax income and the companys income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated $29 million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates. 

Residual Value 

Residual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating or capital. Global Financing estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are periodically reviewed and other than temporary declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification. Anticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed. 

Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment.

To the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than managements estimates by 10 percent, Global Financings segment pre-tax income and the companys income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2018 would have been lower by an estimated $70 million. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than managements estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end of lease when the equipment is remarketed. 

Currency Rate Fluctuations 

Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys financial results and financial position. At December 31, 2018, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2017. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions. 

During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results. 

The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the companys year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in 2018. Based on the currency rate movements in 2018, total revenue increased 0.6 percent as reported and was flat at constant currency versus 2017. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $300 million in 2018, on both an as-reported basis and operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $100 million in 2017 on an as-reported basis and an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace. 

For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 

During 2018 there were reported economic events impacting the Argentinean economy, such as significant depreciation of the Argentine peso, increases in interest rates and the Argentine government requesting financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The three-year cumulative inflation rates, using a combination of monthly indices, exceeded the 100 percent threshold for hyperinflation. As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina with no material impact. The ongoing impact from the change is not expected to be material given the size of the companys operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2018 revenue). 

Market Risk 

In the normal course of business, the financial position of the company is routinely subject to a variety of risks. In addition to the market risk associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of risk include collectibility of accounts receivable and recoverability of residual values on leased assets. 

The company regularly assesses these risks and has established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. As a result, the company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks. 

The companys debt, in support of the Global Financing business and the geographic breadth of the companys operations, contains an element of market risk from changes in interest and currency rates. The company manages this risk, in part, through the use of a variety of financial instruments including derivatives, as described in note D, Financial Instruments  Derivative Financial Instruments, on pages 97 to 102. 

To meet disclosure requirements, the company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of the companys debt and other financial instruments. 

The financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis are comprised of the companys cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term and long-term loans, commercial financing and installment payment receivables, investments, long-term and short-term debt and derivative financial instruments. The companys derivative financial instruments generally include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward contracts.

To perform the sensitivity analysis, the company assesses the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market-sensitive instruments. The market values for interest and foreign currency exchange risk are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in rates that are attributable to the market risk being measured. The discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk. 

Information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that the company would incur under normal market conditions because, due to practical limitations, all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant. In addition, the results of the model are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically excluded from the analysis, while the financial instruments relating to the financing or hedging of those items are included by definition. Excluded items include short-term and long-term receivables from sales-type and direct financing leases, forecasted foreign currency cash flows and the companys net investment in foreign operations. As a consequence, reported changes in the values of some of the financial instruments impacting the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge. 

The results of the sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2018 and 2017, are as follows: 

Interest Rate Risk 

At December 31, 2018, a 10 percent decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of the companys financial instruments of $422 million as compared with a decrease of $201 million at December 31, 2017. A 10 percent increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair value of the companys financial instruments of $408 million as compared to an increase of $232 million at December 31, 2017. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of the companys financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in the companys debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

At December 31, 2018, a 10 percent weaker U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase in the fair value of the companys financial instruments of $697 million as compared with an increase of $363 million at December 31, 2017. Conversely, a 10 percent stronger U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of the companys financial instruments of $697 million compared with a decrease of $363 million at December 31, 2017. 

Financing Risks 

See the Description of Business on page 25 for a discussion of the financing risks associated with the Global Financing business and managements actions to mitigate such risks. 

Cybersecurity 

While cybersecurity risk can never be completely eliminated, the companys approach draws on the depth and breadth of its global capabilities, both in terms of its offerings to clients and its internal approaches to risk management. The company offers commercial solutions that deliver capabilities in areas such as identity and access management, data security, application security, network security and endpoint security. IBMs solutions include pervasive encryption, security intelligence, analytics, cognitive and artificial intelligence, and forensic tools that can process information on customer IT security events and vulnerabilities and provide detailed information to customers about potential threats and security posture.

In addition, the company offers managed and outsourced security solutions from multiple security operations centers around the world. Finally, security is embedded in a multitude of IBM products and offerings through secure engineering and operations, and by critical functions (encryption, access control, etc.) in servers, storage, software, services, and other solutions. 

From an enterprise perspective, IBM implements a multi-faceted risk-management approach to identify and address cybersecurity risks. The company has established policies and procedures that provide the foundation upon which IBMs infrastructure and data are managed. IBM performs ongoing assessments regarding its technical controls and its methods for identifying emerging risks related to cybersecurity. The company uses a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against cybersecurity attacks and threats on networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data and cloud solutions. The company also has a security monitoring program and a global incident response process to respond to cybersecurity threats and attacks. In addition, the company utilizes a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among its workforce.

Management Responsibility for Financial Information 

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required. 

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. An important element of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program. Our system also contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 

To assure the effective administration of internal controls, we carefully select and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and procedures, provide appropriate communication channels and foster an environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal programs to assure that they are understood and followed. 

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of independent, non-management directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent registered public accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder ratification. The Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, with the companys internal auditors, as well as with IBM management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and financial reporting matters. 

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit IBMs Consolidated Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Its accompanying report is based on audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
