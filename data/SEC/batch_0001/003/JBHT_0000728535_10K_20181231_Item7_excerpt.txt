ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in Item 8. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. We consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following: 

Workers’ Compensation and Accident Costs 

We purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. Certain insurance arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim. We have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs. We are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment. 

The amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on measurement dates, policy expiration dates, and claim type. We have policies in place for 2019 with substantially the same terms as our 2018 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage, with the exception of decreasing our self-insured portion of workers’ compensation claims to zero for nearly all states. 

Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal, economic, and regulatory factors. Our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability. This process involves the use of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor, if applicable. In doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurred-but-not-reported claims. We do not discount our estimated losses. At December 31, 2018, we had an accrual of approximately $260 million for estimated claims. In addition, we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of self-insurance levels on covered claims. At December 31, 2018, we have recorded $261 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims, other insurance deposits, and prepaid insurance premiums. 

Revenue Equipment 

We operate a significant number of tractors, trucks, containers, chassis, and trailers in connection with our business. This equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements. In addition, we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under short-term rental arrangements. Purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or trade-in value. We periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment. We have not identified any impairment to our assets at December 31, 2018. 

15 

We have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment. We have utilized these trade-in values, as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles, in accounting for depreciation expense. If our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for trade-in values, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 

Revenue Recognition 

We record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services. Accordingly, we serve as a principal in the transaction. We invoice our customers, and we maintain discretion over pricing. Additionally, we are responsible for selection of third-party transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements. 

We recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided, with related expenses recognized as incurred. Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period. 

Our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments. The allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience, as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability. The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under the liability method. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings. Deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences. To the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we include an expense as part of our income tax provision. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted in December 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. At December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future, which was generally 21%. The provisional amount recorded resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $309.2 million, which was included as a component of 2017 income tax from continuing operations. During 2018, we finalized our calculations for our 2017 federal income tax return, which was filed based on the law prior to the Act, resulting in no significant change to the initial measurement of these balances. Remaining aspects of the Act were not relevant to our operations. 

Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income taxes. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Further, a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved. See Note 7, Income Taxes, in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2018 Compared With 2017 

Consolidated Operating Revenues 

Our total consolidated operating revenues increased 19.8% to $8.61 billion in 2018, compared to $7.19 billion in 2017, primarily due to overall increased load volume and higher revenue per load in all four of our segments. Fuel surcharge revenues increased 40.2% to $1.1 billion in 2018, compared to $754 million in 2017. If fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2018 revenue increased 17.4% over 2017. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses 

Our 2018 consolidated operating expenses increased 20.8% from 2017, while year-over-year revenue increased 19.8%, resulting in a 2018 operating ratio of 92.1% compared to 91.3% in 2017. Rents and purchased transportation costs increased 21.5% in 2018, primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume, which increased services provided by third-party rail and truck carriers within JBI and ICS segments. In addition, our JBI segment incurred charges of $152.3 million to rail purchase transportation expense related to the ongoing arbitration with BNSF. Salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 19.8% in 2018 from 2017. This increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers. 

Fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 32.1% in 2018 compared with 2017, due primarily to an increase in road miles and increases in the price of fuel during 2018. We have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers. These programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national, regional, or local fuel prices. While these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly, most also reflect a specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue. As a result, some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues. Due to these programs, this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly. 

17 

It is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third parties. These payments are classified as purchased transportation expense. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 13.7% in 2018, primarily due to additions to our JBI segment tractor, container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand and equipment purchased related to new DCS long-term customer contracts. 

Operating supplies and expenses increased 18.0%, driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts, higher travel costs, increased toll costs, and higher building maintenance expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 29.7% from 2017, primarily due to increased building and computer rentals, higher professional fees, higher advertising costs, higher bad debt expense driven by a customer bankruptcy, and increased net losses from asset sales and disposals, partially offset by the 2017 inclusion of a $20.2 million reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery. Additionally, net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $12.1 million in 2018, compared to net losses of $7.4 million in 2017. Insurance and claims expense increased 4.7% in 2018, primarily due to higher incident volume. 

Net interest expense for 2018 increased by 40.8% compared with 2017, due to an increase in average debt levels, higher effective interest rates on our debt, and expenses incurred to refinance our revolving line of credit compared to 2017. 

Our effective income tax rate was 23.6% in 2018 and (15.29%) in 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $309.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2017 resulting from adjustments to our deferred tax balances at December 31, 2017, for the change in future tax rates prescribed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

18 

Segments 

We operated four business segments during calendar year 2018. The operation of each of these businesses is described in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

19 

Operating Data by Segment 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

20 

JBI Segment 

JBI segment revenue increased 15% to $4.72 billion in 2018, from $4.08 billion in 2017. This increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 2% increase in load volume and a 13% increase in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue. Eastern network loads grew at 10% and transcontinental loads decreased 2% compared to 2017. Average length of haul decreased 2% in 2018 when compared to 2017. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 10% compared to 2017. 

Operating income of the JBI segment decreased to $401 million in 2018, from $407 million in 2017. Benefits from volume growth and increased revenue per load were offset by increases in rail purchased transportation costs, which included $152.3 million of additional expense related to the ongoing arbitration with BNSF. Benefits where further offset by higher driver wage and retention costs, higher driver recruiting expenses, higher outsourced dray costs, increased costs for onboarding and integration of container tracking technologies, higher equipment ownership costs, and costs of reduced efficiency and disruptions within the rail network. In addition, 2017 included a $20.2 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery. 

DCS Segment 

DCS segment revenue increased 26% to $2.16 billion in 2018, from $1.72 billion in 2017. Productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, increased 7% when compared to 2017. Productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 5% from 2017. The increase in productivity was primarily a result of better integration of assets between customer accounts, customer rate increases, and increased customer supply chain fluidity during 2018 compared to 2017. In addition, the growth in DCS revenue includes an increase of $113 million in Final Mile Services (FMS) revenue, approximately $66 million of which was derived from the 2017 acquisition of Special Logistics Dedicated, LLC (SLD). DCS ended 2018 with a net additional 1,388 revenue-producing trucks when compared to 2017. 

Operating income of our DCS segment increased to $193 million in 2018, from $171 million in 2017. Increased revenue and improved asset integration was offset by higher costs from the expanded FMS network, increased driver wages and recruiting costs, higher non-driver salaries, wages and benefits, increased maintenance costs on equipment scheduled to be traded in the current year, higher overall insurance and claims costs, implementation costs for new customer contracts and approximately $4.4 million in additional non-cash amortization expense compared to 2017. 

ICS Segment 

ICS segment revenue increased 30% to $1.33 billion in 2018, from $1.02 billion in 2017. Overall volumes increased 24%. Revenue per load increased 5% primarily due to increased contractual and spot rates. Contractual business was approximately 70% of the total load volume and 48% of the total revenue in the 2018, compared to 70% of the total load volume and 53% of the total revenue in 2017. 

Operating income increased to $50 million in 2018, from $23 million in 2017. Gross profit margin improved to 15.4% in the current year compared to 13.3% in 2017 primarily due to improved contractual margins and increased spot market activity. This increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher technology development costs, and increase bad debt expense due to a customer bankruptcy. Approximately $558 million of ICS revenue for 2018 was executed through the marketplace for JBHunt360. ICS’s carrier base increased 29%, and the employee count increased 20% when compared to 2017. 

JBT Segment 

JBT segment revenue increased 10% to $417 million in 2018, from $378 million in 2017. Excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2018 increased 9% compared to 2017, primarily from a 16% increase in rates per loaded mile, partially offset by an 4% decrease in load count. 

21 

JBT segment had operating income of $37 million in 2018 compared with $23 million in 2017. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher rates per loaded mile and lower equipment ownership costs, partially offset by increased driver wage and retention costs, higher driver and independent contractor recruiting expenses, and higher independent contractor costs per mile. 

2017 Compared With 2016 

Consolidated Operating Revenues 

Our total consolidated operating revenues increased 9.7% to $7.19 billion in 2017, compared to $6.56 billion in 2016, primarily due to overall increased load volume and higher revenue per load in our JBI, DCS, and ICS segments. Fuel surcharge revenues increased 37.5% to $754 million in 2017, compared to $548 million in 2016. If fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2017 revenue increased 7.1% over 2016. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses 

Our 2017 consolidated operating expenses increased 12.5% from 2016, while year-over-year revenue increased 9.7%, resulting in a 2017 operating ratio of 91.3% compared to 89.0% in 2016. Rents and purchased transportation costs increased 12.1% in 2017, primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume, which increased services provided by third-party rail and truck carriers within JBI and ICS segments. Salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increase 9.5% in 2017 from 2016. This increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers. In addition, 2016 included a $15.2 million benefit recorded to reflect a change in our employee paid time off policy. 

Fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 22.6% in 2017 compared with 2016, due primarily to increases in the price of fuel during 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 6.1% in 2017, primarily due to additions to our JBI segment tractor, container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand and equipment purchased related to new DCS long-term customer contracts. 

Operating supplies and expenses increased 10.3%, driven primarily by increased mileage activity and tire expense. General and administrative expenses increased 44.6% from 2016, primarily due to a $20.2 million reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery, increased building rental expense, higher professional fee expenses, higher computer software subscription costs, and increased net losses from asset sales and disposals in 2017. Net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $7.4 million in 2017, compared to net losses of $5.5 million in 2016. Insurance and claims expense increased 57.6% in 2017, primarily due to higher incident volume and accident severity and an $18.6 million increase in reserves for certain claims not covered by insurance. 

Net interest expense for 2017 increased by 13.2% compared with 2016, due to an increase in average debt levels and higher effective interest rates on our debt during 2017. 

Our effective income tax rate was (15.29)% in 2017 and 37.90% in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a $309.2 million decrease in income tax expense resulting from adjustments to our deferred tax balances at December 31, 2017, for the change in future tax rates prescribed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

JBI Segment 

JBI segment revenue increased 7.6% to $4.08 billion in 2017, from $3.80 billion in 2016. This increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 4.4% increase in load volume and a 3.1% increase in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue. Load volume in our transcontinental loads grew 7.2% while our eastern network was relatively flat compared to 2016. Average length of haul increased 1.4% in 2017 when compared to 2016. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharge was flat in 2017 when compared to 2016. 

22 

Operating income of the JBI segment decreased to $407 million in 2017, from $450 million in 2016. Benefits from volume growth and increased revenue per load were offset by increases in rail purchased transportation costs, rail inefficiencies, higher driver wages and recruiting costs, higher equipment ownership costs, increased insurance and claims costs, which included an $8.5 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims, and the $20.2 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery. In addition, 2016 included a $5.7 million, one-time benefit from the change in paid time off policy. 

DCS Segment 

DCS segment revenue increased 12.1% to $1.72 billion in 2017, from $1.53 billion in 2016. Productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, increased 3.7% when compared to 2016. Revenue, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 10.0% in 2017 compared to 2016, and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 1.6% from 2016. The increase in revenue in 2017 was primarily a result of better integration of assets among customer accounts and customer rate increases, partially offset by lower productivity under new customer contracts, compared to 2016. DCS ended 2017 with a net additional 1,326 revenue-producing trucks when compared to 2016. 

Operating income of our DCS segment decreased to $171 million in 2017, from $205 million in 2016. The increase in revenue and improved asset utilization were offset by higher driver wages and recruiting costs, increased insurance and claims cost, which included a $7.6 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims, increased start up expenditures for new customer contracts, higher equipment ownership costs, and the addition of acquisition costs and intangible asset amortization associated with the purchase of SLD when compared to 2016. In addition, 2016 included a $7.3 million, one-time benefit from the change in paid time off policy. 

ICS Segment 

ICS segment revenue increased 20.3% to $1.02 billion in 2017, from $852 million in 2016. Overall volumes increased 16.5%. Revenue per load increased 3.3% primarily due to freight mix changes driven by customer demand. Contractual business was approximately 70% of the total load volume and 53% of the total revenue in the 2017, compared to 74% of the total load volume and 64% of the total revenue in 2016. 

Operating income decreased to $23 million in 2017, from $36 million in 2016, primarily due to lower gross profit margins, increased insurance and claims cost, which included a $1.8 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims, increased number of branches less than two years old, and higher technology development costs. ICS gross profit margin decreased to 13.3% for 2017 from 14.3% for 2016. ICS’s carrier base increased 11.4%, and the employee count increased 15.8% when compared to 2016. In addition, 2016 included a $1.0 million, one-time benefit from the change in paid time off policy. 

JBT Segment 

JBT segment revenue decreased 2.4% to $378 million in 2017, from $388 million in 2016, primarily from a 3.8% decrease in load count partially offset by a 1.4% increase in revenue per load. Excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2017 decreased 4.5% compared to 2016, primarily due to the reduction in load volume and a 4.4% decrease in length of haul. 

JBT segment had operating income of $23 million in 2017 compared with $30 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower revenue, increased driver wages and recruiting costs, higher independent contractor cost per mile, increased insurance and claims cost, which included an $0.7 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims, and increased tractor maintenance costs compared to 2016. In addition, 2016 included a $1.2 million, one-time benefit from the change in paid time off policy. 

23 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.09 billion in 2018, compared to $855 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax earnings and the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2018. 

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $887 million in 2018, compared with $651 million in 2017. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in equipment purchases, net of proceeds from the sale of equipment, in 2018, partially offset by the 2017 purchase of SLD. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $208 million in 2018, compared with $196 million in 2017. This increase resulted primarily from lower proceeds from long-term debt issuances, net of long-term debt repayments, partially offset by a decrease in treasury stock purchased in 2018. 

Our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors, and payments are dependent upon our financial condition, liquidity, earnings, capital requirements, and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. We paid a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend in 2016, a $0.23 per share quarterly dividend in 2017, and a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend in 2018. On January 23, 2019, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.24 to $0.26 per share, which will be paid February 22, 2019, to stockholders of record on February 8, 2019. We currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid. 

Liquidity 

Our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers, chassis, trucks, tractors, and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment. We are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions. We obtain capital through cash generated from operations, revolving lines of credit, and long-term debt issuances. We have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment. 

In September 2018, we replaced our $500 million senior revolving credit facility dated September 2015 with a new credit facility authorizing us to borrow up to $750 million under a senior revolving line of credit, which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires September 2023. This senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to $250 million and to request a one-year extension of the maturity date. The applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees. At December 31, 2018, we had $309 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 3.47% under this agreement. 

Our senior notes consist of three separate issuances. The first and second issuances are $250 million of 2.40% senior notes due March 2019 and $250 million of 3.85% senior notes due March 2024, respectively, both of which were issued in March 2014. Interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in March and September of each year. The third issuance is $350 million of 3.30% senior notes due August 2022, issued in August 2015. Interest payments under this note are due semiannually in February and August of each year. We may redeem for cash some or all of these notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture. We currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our $250 million of 2.40% fixed-rate senior notes due March 2019 and our $350 million of 3.30% fixed-rate senior notes due August 2022 to variable rates, resulting in interest rates of 3.63% and 3.97%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on LIBOR plus an established margin. For our senior notes maturing in 2019, it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full, on or before the maturity dates, using our existing senior revolving line of credit or other sources of long-term financing. In addition, we have a shelf registration filed with the SEC and may draw upon it as warranted. 

Our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at December 31, 2018. 

24 

As previously mentioned above, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which had a positive effect on our overall liquidity. 

We believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operations, and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. 

We are currently committed to spend approximately $381.6 million, net of proceeds from sales or trade-ins, during 2019 and 2020, which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers, chassis, and tractors. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In addition to our net purchase commitments of $381.6 million, our only other off-balance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $117.8 million of obligations, primarily related to facility leases. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

The following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments (in millions) as of December 31, 2018: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at December 31, 2018. 

We had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $1.3 million at December 31, 2018, that expire at various dates in 2019, which are related to certain operating agreements and our self-insured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims. We plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third-party agreements. The table above excludes $56.8 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement. See Note 7, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
