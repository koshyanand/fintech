 United States   

 In the United States, Murphy primarily has production of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from fields in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company produced approximately 58,200 barrels of crude oil and gas liquids per day and approximately 46 MMCF of natural gas per day in the U.S. in 2018. These amounts represented 57.2% of the Company’s total worldwide oil and gas liquids and 10.9% of worldwide natural gas production volumes.   

 Offshore  

 On November 30, 2018, Murphy Expro USA and Petrobras America Inc. (PAI), a subsidiary of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., closed a transaction among Murphy, PAI and MP Gulf of Mexico, LLC (MP GOM), a subsidiary of Murphy. The transaction had an effective date of October 1, 2018. Under the terms of the transaction, Murphy paid cash consideration of $794.6 million and transferred a 20% interest in MP GOM to PAI. Murphy could also owe additional contingent consideration up to $150 million if certain sales thresholds are exceeded beginning in 2019 through 2025. PAI and Murphy contributed all of their Gulf of Mexico producing assets and Murphy contributed its interest in the Medusa Spar LLC to MP GOM. Following closing of the transaction, MP GOM is owned 80% by Murphy and 20% by PAI. Throughout this 10K report, unless stated otherwise, financial and operational metrics relating to MP GOM include PAI’s 20% noncontrolling interest in MP GOM. 100% of revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows of MP GOM are fully consolidated in the financial statements.  

 During 2018, approximately 34% of total U.S. hydrocarbon production was produced at fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 91% of Gulf of Mexico production in 2018 was derived from seven fields, including Dalmatian, Medusa, Kodiak, Front Runner, Thunder Hawk, St. Malo and Chinook. Through MP GOM, including the noncontrolling interest, the Company now holds a 70% operated interest in Dalmatian in DeSoto Canyon Blocks 4 and 134, a 60% operated interest in Medusa in Mississippi Canyon Blocks 538/582, a 29.1% non-operated interest in Kodiak in Mississippi Canyon Blocks 727/771, a 62.5% operated interest in the Front Runner field in Green Canyon Blocks 338/339, a 62.5% operated interest in the Thunder Hawk field in Mississippi Canyon Block 734, a 100% interest in Cascade and Cottonwood, a 66.6% operated interest in Chinook Walker Ridge 425/469, a 25% non-operated interest in St Malo Walker Ridge 633/634/677/678, and a 11.5% non-operated interest in Lucius.   

 Total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018 was 19,800 barrels of liquids and approximately 14 MMCF of natural gas. At December 31, 2018, Murphy had total proved reserves for Gulf of Mexico fields of 132.9 million barrels of oil and gas liquids and 53.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas.    

 Onshore  

 The Company holds rights to approximately 135 thousand gross acres in South Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale unconventional oil and gas play. Total 2018 production in the Eagle Ford area was 38,200 barrels of oil and liquids per day and approximately 32 MMCF per day of natural gas. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, Eagle Ford production accounted for 66% of total U.S. production volumes in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s proved reserves for the U.S. Onshore business totaled 241.2 million barrels of liquids and 255.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas.   

 ﻿  

 Canada   

 In Canada, the Company holds one wholly-owned natural gas area (Tupper) in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), working interests in the Kaybob Duvernay (operated) and liquids rich Placid Montney (non-operated) lands also in the WCSB and two non-operated assets – the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin.  

 Onshore  

 The Company has approximately 94 thousand gross acres of Tupper Montney mineral rights located in northeast British Columbia. In 2016, the Company completed its transaction to divest natural gas processing and sales pipeline assets that support Murphy’s Montney natural gas fields in the Tupper area. Total cash consideration received by Murphy upon closing of the transaction was $414.1 million. Connected with this sale, the Company entered into a commitment for natural gas processing capacity for minimum monthly payments through 2035. In 2018, the Company entered into a further commitment, commencing November 2020 for an additional 200 MMCFD.  

 2  

In 2016, the Company acquired a 70% operated working interest in Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30% non-operated working interest in liquids rich Placid Montney lands, both in Alberta. The Company has approximately 349 thousand gross acres of Kaybob and Placid mineral rights.  

 Also in 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its wholly-owned Seal field located in the Peace River oil sands area of northwest Alberta. This sale was completed in January 2017 and the Company received net proceeds of $48.8 million. Finally, in 2016, MOCL completed the sale of its 5% undivided interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd. (Syncrude) for net proceeds of $739.1 million.  

 Daily production in 2018 in the WCSB averaged 6,800 barrels of liquids and approximately 266 MMCF of natural gas, an increase of 84.7% and 17.7% versus 2017, respectively. Total WCSB proved liquids and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2018, were approximately 43.3 million barrels and 1.4 trillion cubic feet, respectively.   

 Offshore  

 Murphy has a 6.5% working interest in Hibernia Main and a 4.3% working interest in Hibernia South Extension, while at Terra Nova the Company’s working interest is 10.475%. Oil production in 2018 was approximately 6,700 barrels of oil per day for the two offshore Canada fields. Total proved oil reserves at December 31, 2018 for the two fields were approximately 17.6 million barrels of liquids and 12.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  

 ﻿  

 Malaysia   

 In Malaysia, the Company has majority interests in seven separate production sharing contracts (PSCs). The Company serves as the operator of all these areas other than the unitized Kakap-Gumusut field. The PSCs cover approximately 2.6 million gross acres.  

 Sarawak  

 Murphy has a 59.5% interest in oil and natural gas discoveries in two shallow-water blocks, SK 309 and SK 311, offshore Sarawak. Approximately 12,700 barrels of liquids per day were produced in 2018 at Blocks SK 309/311.   

 The Company has a gas sales contract for the Sarawak area with Petronas, the Malaysian state-owned oil company, and has an ongoing multi-phase development plan for several natural gas discoveries on these blocks. The gas sales contract allows for gross sales volumes of 250 MMCF per day through September 2021 (with extension options), but allows the Company to deliver higher sales volumes as requested. The Company’s net share of volumes is sold via this contract.   

 Total net natural gas sales volume offshore Sarawak was approximately 104 MMCF per day during 2018.   

 Total proved reserves at December 31, 2018 for Blocks SK 309/311 were 10.7 million barrels of liquids and approximately 117.7 billion cubic feet (BCF), respectively.  

 Other Sarawak  

 In November 2017, the Company acquired a 59.5% working interest in Sarawak SK405B PSC. The block SK405B is approximately 2,305 square kilometers (890 square miles) and has water depths in the range from 10 to 50 meters (33 to 164 feet). Under the terms of the PSC, the Company will operate the block with a participating interest of 59.5%.  

 In February 2016, the Company acquired a 40% working interest in Block Deepwater SK2A PSC, offshore Sarawak. The Company operates the block with a commitment to acquire and process new 3D seismic. The commitment was fulfilled during 2016. This interest expired in June 2018.   

 In February 2015, the Company acquired a 50% interest in Block SK 2C, offshore Sarawak. The Company operates the block that carried one well commitment during the one-year initial exploration period. The exploration well was drilled in 2015, and the first exploration period was extended for a further eighteen months. In 2016, the Company elected not to enter the next exploration period. The Company currently has a gas holding area for a gas field that will expire in August 2021.  

 3  

 In May 2013, the Company acquired an interest in shallow-water Malaysia Block SK 314A. The PSC covered a three-year exploration period. The Company’s working interest in Block SK 314A is 59.5%. This block includes 488 thousand gross acres. The Company has a 70% carry of a 15% partner in this concession through the minimum work program. The first two exploration wells were drilled in 2015 and the third well in 2016. The Company has successfully secured an annexation of an open area in Sarawak to SK 314A to complete the remaining fourth and fifth exploration commitment wells which is currently scheduled for 2019.  

 Block K  

 The Company’s working interest in the Kakap field in Block K is 6.35%, following a series of unitization and redeterminations.  

 In 2006, the Kakap field in Block K was unitized with the Gumusut field in an adjacent block under a Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement (UUOA) between the parties. The Gumusut-Kakap Unit is operated by another company. In the fourth quarter 2016, the owners completed the first redetermination process for a revision to the blocks’ tract participation interest, and the operator of the unitized field sought the approval of Petronas to effect the change in 2017. In relation to this matter, in 2016, the Company recorded an estimated redetermination expense of $39.1 million ($24.1 million after taxes) related to an expected revision in the Company’s working interest covering the period from inception through year-end 2016 at Kakap, of which $17.3 million remains as a liability at the end of 2018. In February 2017, the Company received Petronas official approval to the redetermination change that reduced the Company’s working interest in oil operations to 6.67% effective at April 1, 2017. Working interest redeterminations are required at different points within the life of the unitized field.  

 In 2017, following a further Unitization Framework Agreement (UFA) between the governments of Brunei and Malaysia the Company has a 6.35% interest in the Kakap field in Block K Malaysia. The UFA unitized the Gumusut/Kakap (GK) and Geronggong/Jagus East fields effective November 23, 2017. The Company has recorded an estimated redetermination expense of $26.3 million ($16.3 million after taxes) related to the Company’s revised working interest, all of which remains as a liability at the end of 2018.   

 The Siakap oil field was developed as a unitized area with the Petai field operated by others, and the combined development is operated by Murphy, with a tie-back to the Kikeh field with production beginning in 2014. Oil production at Block K averaged approximately 16,700 barrels per day during 2018.   

 The Company has a Block K natural gas sales contract with Petronas that calls for gross sales volumes of up to 120 MMCF per day. Gas production in Block K will continue until the earlier of lack of available commercial quantities of associated gas reserves or expiry of the Block K production sharing contract. Natural gas production in Block K in 2018 totaled 6 MMCF per day.   

 Total proved reserves booked in Block K at the end of 2018 were 40.0 million barrels of liquids and about 26.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas.   

 Block H  

 The Company also has an interest in deepwater Block H offshore Sabah. In early 2007, the Company announced a significant natural gas discovery at the Rotan well in Block H. The Company followed up Rotan with several other nearby discoveries. Murphy’s interests in Block H range between 42% and 56%. Total gross acreage held by the Company at the end of 2018 in Block H was 679 thousand gross acres. In early 2014, Petronas and the Company sanctioned a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) project for Block H, and agreed terms for sales of natural gas to be produced with prices tied to an oil index. First production is currently expected at Block H in mid-2020. At December 31, 2018, total natural gas proved reserves for Block H were approximately 324.4 billion cubic feet.   

 Block P  

 The Company had a 42% interest in a gas holding area covering approximately 1,854 gross acres in Block P. This interest expired in January 2018.   

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Brunei   

 The Company has a working interest of 8.05% in Block CA-1 and a 30% working interest in Block CA-2.   

 On November 23, 2017, both the governments of Brunei and Malaysia signed a UFA (see Malaysia section above) which resulted in Jagus East discovery in Block CA-1 forming part of a unitized field with the GK Unit in Malaysia.   

 4  

Following this unitization, the Company’s working interest in the Brunei section of the Kakap field was adjusted and on July 4, 2018 a participation agreement was signed which finalized the Company’s working interest of 8.05%.  

 The CA-1 and CA-2 blocks cover 1.44 million and 1.49 million gross acres, respectively. Four exploration wells were drilled in Block CA-1 and six exploration wells were drilled in Block CA-2 by the end of 2018.   

 The Company has a 30% non-operating working interest in Block CA-2. In December 2014, the authority PetroleumBrunei approved a gas marketing plan which sets an eight-year gas holding period until December 2022. The consortium is presently carrying out a concept select study to assist in commercial discussions.  

 ﻿  

 Australia   

 In Australia, the Company holds six offshore exploration permits and serves as operator of four of them.   

 In December 2017, Murphy signed a farm-in agreement to acquire a 40% non-operated interest in AC/P21 in the Vulcan Basin, offshore Northern Australia. Acquisition of multiclient 3D seismic commenced over the permitted area in December 2017 and was completed in December 2018. The permit covers approximately 165 thousand acres and expires in June 2019 with an option to extend.   

 In March 2015, Murphy was awarded the AC/P59 license, another acreage position in the Vulcan Basin with 60% interest and operatorship. The block covers approximately 288 thousand gross acres. The acquisition of multiclient 3D seismic commenced in 2016 and was completed in 2017. The permit expires in 2022 with an option to renew.   

 In April 2014 and June 2014, Murphy was awarded licenses AC/P57 and AC/P58 in the Vulcan Basin. The blocks cover approximately 82 thousand and 692 thousand gross acres, respectively. These exploration permits require 3D seismic reprocessing and a gravity survey that were completed in 2017. The permits expire in 2020 with an option to renew.  

 In October 2013, Murphy was awarded the EPP43 license in the Ceduna Basin, offshore South Australia, with 50% interest & operatorship. The block covers approximately 4.1 million acres. Acquisition of multiclient 3D seismic commenced over the permit in 2016 and the fully processed seismic was received in 2017. The first exploration period of the permit expires in 2021 with an option to renew.  

 In November 2007, Murphy signed a farm in agreement to acquire 40% of AC/P36, in the Browse Basin, offshore northern Australia in the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. The block covers approximately 482 thousand gross acres. Murphy currently holds a non-operated 50% interest and is carried for the existing exploration commitments. The permit is in its first renewal period which currently expires in 2020 with a further option to renew.  

 ﻿  

 Vietnam   

 The Company holds a 65% working interest in Blocks 144 and 145, a 60% interest in Block 11-2/11 and a 40% interest in Block 15-1/05.  

 In November 2012, the Company signed a PSC with Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group and PetroVietnam Exploration Production Company (PVEP), where it acquired a 65% interest and operatorship of Blocks 144 and 145. The blocks cover approximately 6.56 million gross acres and are located in the outer Phu Khanh Basin. The Company acquired 2D seismic for these blocks in 2013 and undertook seabed surveys in 2015 and 2016. The remaining commitment of the acquisition, processing and interpretation of six hundred square kilometers (600 km2) of 3D seismic is tentatively scheduled for 2020.  

 In June 2013, the Company acquired a 60% working interest and operatorship of Block 11-2/11 under another PSC. The block covers 677 thousand gross acres. The Company acquired 3D seismic and performed other geological and geophysical studies in this block in 2013. This concession carries a three-well commitment which has been fulfilled with the first exploration well drilled in 2016 and the second and third wells drilled in 2017.   

 In August 2015, the Company signed a farm-in agreement to acquire 35% of Block 15-1/05 and in 2018 became the operator and increased its working interest to 40%. The exploration phase expired in December 2018 and is extended until December 2019. The exploration license calls for one exploration well commitment, which is planned to be drilled in 2019.  The Lac Da Trang (LDT) 1X exploration well, the last remaining commitment of the PSC, is scheduled to commence in 2019. Effective January 11, 2019, the Declaration of Commercial Discovery of the Lac Da Vang (LDV) project was approved. First oil from LDV is currently planned by the end of 2021.  

 5  

Mexico   

 In December 2016, Murphy and joint venture partners were the high bidder on Block 5, which was offered as part of Mexico’s fourth phase, Round one deepwater auction. Murphy was formally awarded the block in March 2017. Murphy is the operator of the Block with a 30% working interest. Block 5 is located in the deepwater Salinas basin covering approximately 640,000 gross acres (2,600 square kilometers) and water depths in this block range from 2,300 to 3,500 feet (700 to 1,100 meters). The initial exploration period for the license is four years and includes a commitment to drill one exploration well which is planned for early 2019.  

 ﻿  

 Brazil  

 The Company now holds an interest in 6 blocks in Brazil (SEAL-M-351, SEAL-M-428, SEAL-M-430, SEAL-M-501, SEAL-M-503 and SEAL-M-573). ExxonMobil has a 50% working interest and is the operator of the blocks, Murphy has a 20% working interest and QGEP holds a 30% working interest.   

 In 2017, the Company entered into a farm-in agreement with Queiroz Galvão Exploração e Produção S.A. (QGEP) to acquire a 20% working interest in Blocks SEAL-M-351 and SEAL-M-428, located in the deepwater Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, offshore Brazil. QGEP retained a 30% working interest in the blocks and, in a separate but related transaction, ExxonMobil Exploração Brasil Ltda. (an affiliate of ExxonMobil Corporation) farmed into the remaining 50% working interest as the operator. Subsequent to the farm-in, Murphy and its co-venturers were the high bidder in Brazil’s Round 14 lease sale, for leases which are adjacent to SEAL-M-351 and SEAL-M-428.  

 In 2018, the co-venturer’s were the successful bidders on blocks 430 and 573.  

 Murphy’s total acreage position in Brazil is 746,000 gross acres over the six blocks, offsetting several major Petrobras discoveries, with no well commitments.   

 ﻿  

 Ecuador  

 Murphy sold its 20% working interest in Block 16, Ecuador in March 2009. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador passed a law that increased its share of revenue for sales prices that exceed a base price (about $23.36 per barrel at December 31, 2008) from 50% to 99%. The government had previously enacted a 50% revenue sharing rate in April 2006. The Company initiated arbitration proceedings against the government in one arbitral body claiming that the government did not have the right under the contract to enact the revenue sharing provision. In 2010, the arbitration panel determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim due to technicalities. The arbitration was refiled in 2011 before a different arbitral body and the arbitration hearing was held in late 2014. On February 10, 2017, the arbitration panel issued its final decision and awarded Murphy the sum of $31.3 million. In May 2017, Ecuador instituted a proceeding in the Netherlands district court located in The Hague to set aside the award. Murphy filed an opposition and settled for $26.0 million, which was received in 2018.

 Proved Reserves  

 ﻿  

 Total proved reserves for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas as of December 31, 2018 are presented in the following table.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 1 Includes proved developed reserves of 19.1 MMBBL oil, 0.8 MMBBL NGLs, and 8.2 BCF natural gas for Total and United States attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.  

 2 Includes proved undeveloped reserves of 6.4 MMBBL oil, 0.3 MMBBL NGLs, and 2.6 BCF natural gas for Total and United States attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.  

 3 Includes total proved reserves of 25.5 MMBBL oil, 1.1 MMBBL NGLs, and 10.8 BCF natural gas for Total and United States attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.  

 ﻿  

 Murphy Oil’s total proved reserves and proved undeveloped reserves increased during 2018 as presented in the table below:  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1 For purposes of these computations, natural gas sales volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six MCF of natural gas to one barrel of oil.  

 2 Includes 28.4 MMBOE and 7.1 MMBOE for total proved and proved undeveloped reserves, respectively, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.   

 ﻿  

 During 2018, Murphy’s total proved reserves increased by 145.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). The increase in reserves principally relates to continued development in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and the Tupper Montney gas area of Western Canada that added 42.6 MMBOE and 39.0 MMBOE, respectively, as well as improved performance in Malaysia which added 12.0 MMBOE. In addition, Murphy added 97.0 MMBOE of total proved reserves as a result of the MP GOM transaction.  

 7  

 Proved Reserves (Contd.)  

 Murphy’s total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 increased 62.0 MMBOE from a year earlier. The proved undeveloped reserves reported in the table as extensions and discoveries during 2018 were predominantly attributable to three areas: the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and the Western Canada areas of Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay. Each of these areas had active development work ongoing during the year. The majority of proved undeveloped reserves associated with revisions of previous estimates was the result of removing locations in lower performing areas of Western Canada and the Eagle Ford Shale. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves migration to the proved developed category are attributable to drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale, Kaybob Duvernay, and Tupper Montney.   

 The Company spent approximately $824 million in 2018 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. The Company expects to spend approximately $1,300 million in 2019, $1,200 million in 2020 and $900 million in 2021 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The anticipated level of spending in 2019 primarily includes drilling and development in the Eagle Ford Shale, Kaybob Duvernay, Tupper Montney, and Gulf of Mexico areas.   

 At December 31, 2018, proved reserves are included for several development projects, including oil developments at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; Kaybob Duvernay in Western Canada; deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and the Kakap and Kikeh fields, offshore Sabah in Malaysia; and natural gas developments in Tupper Montney and offshore Sabah in Block H and Kikeh in Malaysia. Total proved undeveloped reserves associated with various development projects at December 31, 2018 were approximately 413.7 MMBOE, which represent 49% of the Company’s total proved reserves.  

 Certain development projects have proved undeveloped reserves that will take more than five years to bring to production. The Company operates deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico that have two undeveloped locations that exceed this five-year window. Total reserves associated with the two locations amount to less than 1% of the Company’s total proved reserves at year-end 2018. The development of certain of these reserves stretches beyond five years due to limited well slots available, thus making it necessary to wait for depletion of other wells prior to initiating further development of these locations.  

 The second project that will take more than five years from initial booking to be completely developed is deepwater Block H, offshore Malaysia. Project timing is pending timing of completion of the Floating Liquefied Natural Gas Facility (FLNG) which is ongoing and expected to be on production in 2020. The FLNG will be operated by Malaysia’s national oil company, PETRONAS. The Block H development project represents approximately 6% of the Company’s total proved reserves at year-end 2018.  

 ﻿  

 Murphy Oil’s Reserves Processes and Policies  

 As per the SEC, proved oil and gas reserves are “those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward.” The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.  

 Murphy has established both internal and external controls for estimating proved reserves that follows the guidelines set forth by the SEC for oil and gas reporting. Certain qualified technical personnel of Murphy from the various exploration and production offices are responsible for the preparation of proved reserve estimates and these technical representatives provide the necessary information and maintain the data as well as the documentation for all properties.

 Murphy Oil’s Reserves Processes and Policies (Contd.)  

 The Murphy proved reserves is then consolidated and reported through the Corporate Reserves group. Murphy’s General Manager of Corporate Reserves (Reserves Manager) leads the Corporate Reserves group that also includes Corporate reserve engineers and support staff in which all are independent of the Company’s oil and gas operational management and technical personnel. The Reserves Manager was new to Murphy in 2018 and has over 18 years of industry experience. He has a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering as well as a Master of Business Administration. The Reserves Manager is also a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. The Reserves Manager reports to the Chief Financial Officer and makes annual presentations to the Board of Directors about the Company’s reserves. The Reserves Manager and the Corporate reserve engineers review and discuss reserves estimates directly with the Company’s technical staff in order to make every effort to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Reserves Manager coordinates and oversees the third-party audits which are performed annually and under Company policy generally target coverage of at least one-third of the barrel oil-equivalent volume of the Company’s proved reserves. Internal audits may also be performed by the Reserves Manager and qualified engineering staff from areas of the Company other than the area being audited by third parties.   

 Each significant exploration and production office also maintains one or more Qualified Reserve Estimators (QRE) on staff. The QRE is responsible for estimating and evaluating reserves and other reserves information for his or her assigned area. The QRE may personally make the estimates and evaluations of reserves or may supervise and approve the estimation and evaluation thereof by others. A QRE is professionally qualified to perform these reserves estimates as a result of having sufficient educational background, professional training, and professional experience to enable him or her to exercise prudent professional judgment. Larger offices of the Company also employ a Regional Reserves Coordinator (RRC) who supervises the local QREs. The RRC is usually a senior QRE who has the primary responsibility for coordinating and submitting reserves information to senior management.  

 QRE qualification requires a minimum of five years of practical experience in petroleum engineering or petroleum production geology, with at least three years of such experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, and either a bachelors or advanced degree in petroleum engineering, geology or other discipline of engineering or physical science from a college or university of recognized stature, or the equivalent thereof from an appropriate government authority or professional organization. Murphy provides annual training to all company reserves estimators to ensure SEC requirements associated with reserves estimation and Form 10-K reporting are fulfilled. The training includes materials provided to each participant that outlines the latest guidance from the SEC as well as best practices for many engineering and geologic matters related to reserves estimation.  

 The Company’s QREs maintain files containing pertinent data regarding each significant reservoir. Each file includes sufficient data to support the calculations or analogies used to develop the values. Examples of data included in the file, as appropriate, include: production histories; pertinent drilling and workover histories; bottom hole pressure data; volumetric, material balance, analogy, or other pertinent reserve estimation data; production performance curves; narrative descriptions of the methods and logic used to determine reserves values; maps and logs; and a signed copy of the documentation stating that, in their opinion, the reserves have been calculated, reviewed, documented, and reported in compliance with SEC regulations. When reserves calculations are completed by technical personnel with the support of the QREs and appropriately reviewed by RRCs, the Corporate reserves engineers and the Reserves Manager, the conclusions are reviewed and approved with the heads of the Company’s exploration and production business units and other senior management on an annual basis. The Company’s Controller’s department is responsible for preparing and filing reserves schedules within the Form 10-K report.  

 ﻿  

 To ensure accuracy and security of reported reserves, the proved reserves estimates are coordinated in industry-standard software with access controls for approved users. In addition, Murphy complies with audit controls concerning the various business processes related to reserves.   

 ﻿  

 The estimated proved reserves reported in this Form 10-K report are prepared by Murphy’s internal employees. Murphy engaged both Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) and McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (McDaniel) to perform a reserves audit of 54.3% and 9.4% of the Company’s total proved reserves, respectively. In addition, Ryder Scott provided a proved reserve report for the Petrobras GOM properties which represented 11.5% of the company total proved reserves.

 Murphy Oil’s Reserves Processes and Policies (Contd).  

 More information regarding Murphy’s estimated quantities of proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas for the last three years are presented by geographic area on pages 103 through 110 of this Form 10-K report. Also, Murphy currently has no oil and gas reserves from non-traditional sources. Murphy has not filed and is not required to file any estimates of its total proved oil or gas reserves on a recurring basis with any federal or foreign governmental regulatory authority or agency other than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Annually, Murphy reports gross reserves of properties operated in the United States to the U.S. Department of Energy; such reserves are derived from the same data from which estimated proved reserves of such properties are determined.  

 Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production and sales, and natural gas sales by geographic area with weighted average sales prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 are shown on pages 30 through 31 and 33 of this Form 10-K report.   

 Production expenses for the last three years in U.S. dollars per equivalent barrel are discussed beginning on page 34 of this Form 10-K report.   

 Supplemental disclosures relating to oil and gas producing activities are reported on pages 101 through 116 of this Form 10-K report.  

 ﻿  

 At December 31, 2018, Murphy held leases, concessions, contracts or permits on developed and undeveloped acreage as shown by geographic area in the following table. Gross acres are those in which all or part of the working interest is owned by Murphy. Net acres are the portions of the gross acres attributable to Murphy’s interest.

 As used in the three tables that follow, “gross” wells are the total wells in which all or part of the working interest is owned by Murphy, and “net” wells are the total of the Company’s fractional working interests in gross wells expressed as the equivalent number of wholly-owned wells. An “exploratory” well is drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area and includes delineation wells which target a new reservoir in a field known to be productive or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area. A “development” well is drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir that is known to be productive.  

 The following table shows the number of oil and gas wells producing or capable of producing at December 31, 2018.
