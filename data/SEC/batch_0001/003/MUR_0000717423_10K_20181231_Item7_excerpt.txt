Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 ﻿  

 Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company. A more detailed description of the Company’s significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10-K report.  

 Significant Company operating and financial highlights during 2018 were as follows:  

 ﻿  

   ·    Income from continuing operations before income taxes of $432.3 million (2017: $71.8 million) 

 ﻿  

   ·    Entered into an oil-weighted Gulf of Mexico transaction with Petrobras (see Business Review for further details) 

 ﻿  

   ·    Produced 172,175 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day (170,945 excluding noncontrolling interest, NCI) 

 ﻿  

   ·    Achieved an overall lease operating expense per BOE of $8.86 (2017: $7.89) 

 ﻿  

   ·    Excluding acquisitions, replaced 166% of total proved reserves (2017: 123%) 

 ﻿  

   ·    Preserved balance sheet strength with approximately 35% net debt to total capital 1 (37% excluding NCI) 

 ﻿  

 Throughout this section, the term, ‘excluding noncontrolling interest’ or ‘excluding NCI’ refers to amounts attributable to Murphy.  

 Murphy’s continuing operations generate revenue by producing crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas in the United States, Canada and Malaysia and then selling these products to customers. The Company’s revenue is affected by the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGL. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, depreciation of capital expenditures, and expenses related to exploration, administration, and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders.  

 Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company. In 2018 liquids represented 59% of total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis. In 2019, the Company’s ratio of hydrocarbon production represented by liquids is expected to be 67%. When oil-price linked natural gas in Malaysia is combined with oil production, the Company’s 2019 total expected production is approximately 75% linked to the price of oil. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas are lower in 2019 or beyond, this will have an unfavorable impact on the Company’s operating profits. The Company, from time to time, may choose to use a variety of commodity hedge instruments to reduce commodity price risk, including forward sale fixed financial swaps and long-term fixed-price physical commodity sales.   

 Oil prices strengthened in 2018 compared to the 2017 period. The sales price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $64.77 in 2018, $50.95 in 2017, and $43.32 in 2016. The sales price of a barrel of Platts Dated Brent crude oil increased to $71.04 in 2018, following averages of $54.28 per barrel in 2017 and $43.69 per barrel in 2016. The WTI index increased approximately 27% over the prior year while Dated Brent experienced a 31% increase in 2018.   

 During 2018 the discount for WTI crude compared to Dated Brent increased compared to the prior year. The average WTI to Dated Brent discount was $6.27 per barrel during 2018, $3.33 per barrel during 2017 and $0.37 per barrel in 2016. In early 2019, Dated Brent has been trading at a similar premium to WTI as 2018 average levels. Crude oil prices in early 2019 were below the 2018 average prices.   

 The NYMEX natural gas price per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) averaged $3.12 in 2018, $2.96 in 2017 and $2.48 in 2016. The 2018 NYMEX natural gas price was approximately in line with 2017. NYMEX natural gas prices in 2017 were 19% above the average price in 2016, with the increase largely due to demand generated by LNG export growth and overland deliveries to Mexico. On an energy equivalent basis, the market continued to discount North American natural gas and NGL compared to crude oil in 2018. Natural gas prices in North America in 2019 have thus far been below the average 2018 levels.

 Results of Operations  

 Murphy Oil’s results of operations, with associated diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the last three years are presented in the following table.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Results of continuing operations before taxes in 2018 were improved versus 2017. In 2018, income from continuing operations attributable to Murphy of $414.6 million ($2.37 per diluted share) increased from a loss of $310.9 million ($1.81 per diluted share) in 2017. Murphy Oil’s net income in 2018 included a favorable income tax adjustment of $135.7 million related to the 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The $135.7 million adjustment, primarily related to the reinstatement of a deferred tax asset for 2017 net operating losses, which in 2017, was assumed utilized against the deemed repatriation.   

 The results for 2018 were also favorably impacted by higher revenues (due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices and volumes), higher other operating income (vs 2017 other operating expense), lower foreign exchange losses, and lower exploration expenses; partially offset by losses on crude contracts, lower gain on sale of assets, higher lease operating expenses and higher depreciation.  

 In 2018 the Company’s discontinued operations incurred a loss of $3.5 million.   

 Murphy Oil’s net loss in 2017 vs 2016 was impacted by higher revenues due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices, lower unrealized losses on forward sales commodity contracts, gain on sale of the Seal property in Western Canada, lower lease operating expenses, lower depreciation expense, non-recurring impairment expense in 2016, and lower selling and general expenses, but these were more than offset by higher tax charges (caused by higher pre-tax income and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act), higher exploration expenses, higher other expenses, higher foreign exchange charges, and higher interest expenses.  

 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted into legislation the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). For the year ended December 31, 2017, Murphy recorded a tax expense of $274.0 million directly related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. The charge includes the impact of a deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

 Results in 2016 included a $71.7 million after-tax gain on sale of the Company’s five percent interest in Syncrude. In 2016, the Company’s refining and marketing operations generated a loss of $2.5 million, which led to overall losses from discontinued operations in each year.

 Exploration and Production   

 Please refer to Schedule 5 – Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information section for supporting tables.  

 2018 vs 2017  

 Exploration and production (E&P) continuing operations recorded a profit of $546.9 million in 2018 compared to a profit of $290.3 million in 2017 and a loss of $83.7 million in 2016. The results for 2018 were favorably impacted by higher revenues due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices and volumes, lower gain on sale of assets, lower other exploration expenses, and lower other operating expenses, partially offset by higher lease operating expenses, higher depreciation expense, non-recurring impairment expense in 2018 and higher taxes.   

 Crude oil price realizations averaged $64.30 per barrel in the current year compared to $51.34 per barrel in 2017, a price increase of 25% year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged $2.54 in the current year compared to $2.33 per MCF in 2017, a price increase of 9% year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged US$1.52 in the current year compared to US$1.88 per MCF in 2016, a price decrease of 20% year over year. Oil and gas production costs, including associated production taxes, on a per-unit basis, were $9.69 in 2018 (2017: $8.63), which together with higher oil and natural gas volumes sold, resulted in $96.2 million higher costs in 2018.

 Exploration and Production (Contd.)   

 2018 vs 2017(Contd.)  

 United States E&P operations reported earnings of $242.9 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $8.9 million in 2017. Results were $251.8 million favorable in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period due to higher revenues ($345.3 million), lower depreciation ($26.6 million), and lower G&A ($12.8 million), partially offset by higher lease operating expenses ($32.0 million), higher dry hole costs ($17.9 million, primarily related to the write-off of the King Cake well in the Gulf of Mexico), an impairment charge related to select Midland properties ($20.0 million), and higher income taxes ($68.9 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher realized prices and contribution from new volumes from the MP GOM transaction, while lower depreciation expense was due primarily to lower rates and lower volumes sold at Eagle Ford Shale. Higher lease operating expenses were principally a result of higher costs at Front Runner (due to 2017 Clipper well acquisition) and Kodiak work-over costs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico business. Higher exploration expenditures are principally a result of data acquisition costs in the U.S Gulf of Mexico business.   

 Canadian E&P operations reported earnings of $51.1 million in 2018 compared to earnings of $112.5 million in the 2017 period. Results were unfavorable $61.4 million due to 2017 including a pretax gain of $132.4 million (after tax: $96.0 million) related to the sale of Seal heavy oil assets in Canada in January 2017. Adjusting for the impact of gain on sale of assets, Canadian results of operations improved $34.6 million in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period due to higher revenue ($85.5 million), and insurance proceeds ($21.3 million), partially offset by higher lease operating expense ($21.7 million), higher depreciation ($47.1 million) and higher taxes ($6.5 million). Higher revenues were a result of both higher volumes at the Tupper, Kaybob and Placid assets and higher realized crude prices. Insurance proceeds related to cash received in relation to the spill at the now divested Seal asset. Higher taxes (excluding the Seal gain in 2017) are the result of higher net earnings. Higher lease operating expenses and depreciation are a result of higher volumes sold.   

 Malaysia E&P operations reported earnings of $269.5 million in 2018, compared to earnings of $224.2 million in 2017. Results were favorable by $45.3 million due to higher revenues ($73.1 million), lower depreciation ($6.0 million), and lower redetermination/unitization expense ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher lease operating expenses ($33.3 million), and higher taxes ($16.9 million). Higher revenues are principally due to higher realized prices, partially offset by lower volumes sold. Lower depreciation is due to lower volumes sold. Lower other expenses are due to the cost of a rig exit recorded in 2017. Higher lease operating expenses are due to higher platform, onshore facility and sub-sea maintenance costs. The higher taxes are due to higher pre-tax profits. The redetermination/unitization charges (in both years) relates to the executed unitization agreement for the Gumusut-Kakap (GK) and Geronggong/Jagus East fields originally signed in Q4 2017. Also, in the third quarter of 2018, the Brunei working interest income was recorded as a result of signing the Brunei participation agreement (see below).   

 Other international E&P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of $16.6 million in 2018 compared to a loss of $37.5 million in the 2017 period. The loss was $20.9 million lower in the 2018 period versus 2017 primarily due to the recording of past profits ($21.6 million) relating to the working interest in Block CA1 in Brunei, and lower exploration costs ($16.2 million), partially offset by lower tax benefits on investments in foreign areas ($18.2 million). The Brunei income follows the signing of the Brunei participation agreement on July 4, 2018, which enables the Company the right to claim its proportional share of revenue since inception as well as the obligation to settle the related past operating and capital expenditure costs since inception. In addition, ongoing current Brunei revenue is now being reported.   

 2017 vs 2016

 Exploration and production (E&P) continuing operations recorded a profit of $290.3 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $83.7 million in 2016. The results for 2017 were favorably impacted by higher revenues due to higher realized oil and natural gas liquid sales prices, lower lease operating expenses, lower depreciation expense, lower redetermination expenses, lower dry hole costs, and higher taxes, partially offset by no repeat of the impairment expense in 2016.  

 Crude oil price realizations averaged $51.21 per barrel in 2017 compared to $42.38 per barrel in 2016, a price increase of 21% year over year. WTI crude oil averaged 18% more in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged $2.49 compared to $1.89 per MCF in 2016, a price increase of 32% year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged US$1.97 in 2017 compared to US$1.72 per MCF in 2016, a price increase of 15% year over year. Oil and gas production costs, including associated production taxes, on a per-unit basis, were $8.63 in 2017 (2016: $9.44), which together with lower oil and natural gas volumes sold, resulted in $91.3 million lower costs in 2017.

Exploration and Production (Contd.)   

 2017 vs 2016 (Contd.)  

 United States E&P operations reported a net loss of $8.9 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $164.2 million in 2016. Results were $155.3 million favorable in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period due to higher revenues ($195.2 million) and lower depreciation ($54.4 million), and lower lease operating expenses ($20.1 million), partially offset by exploration costs ($23.5 million) and higher taxes ($64.9 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher realized prices, while lower depreciation expense was due primarily to lower rates and lower volumes sold at Eagle Ford Shale. Lower lease operating expenses were principally a result of continued management effort to reduce costs in the Company’s U.S. Onshore business. Higher exploration costs were due to higher lease amortization and higher taxes resulted from higher profits.   

 Canadian E&P operations reported earnings of $112.5 million in 2017 compared to losses of $35.9 million in the 2016 period. Results were favorable $148.4 million due to 2017 including a pretax gain of $132.4 million (after tax: $96.0 million) related to the sale of Seal heavy oil assets in Canada in January 2017. Adjusting for the impact of gain on sale of assets, Canadian results of operations improved $54.2 million in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period due to lower lease operating expense ($71.3 million), lower depreciation expense ($17.8 million), and no repeat of the 2016 impairment charge on the Company’s Terra Nova field and Seal heavy oil field in Western Canada ($95.1 million), partially offset by lower revenues ($12.2 million) and higher taxes ($142.3 million). Lower lease operating expenses and lower depreciation expense were principally the result of the disposal of the Syncrude asset in mid-2016.   

 Malaysia E&P operations reported earnings of $224.2 million in 2017, compared to earnings of $171.1 million in 2016. Results were favorable by $53.1 million due to higher revenues ($27.7 million), lower depreciation ($23.1 million), and lower redetermination/unitization expense ($24.1 million), partially offset by higher taxes ($40.5 million). Higher revenues are principally due to higher realized prices, partially offset by lower volumes sold. Lower depreciation was a result of lower volumes produced at Block K (as a result of natural field decline).   

 Other international E&P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of $37.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $54.7 million in the 2016 period. The loss was $17.2 million lower in the 2017 period versus 2016 primarily due to 2017 tax benefits on investments in foreign areas ($32.9 million).

 The Company’s reported total crude oil and condensate production averaged 92,114 barrels per day in 2018, compared to 90,431 barrels per day in 2017 and 103,400 barrels per day in 2016. The 2018 crude oil production level was 2% higher than 2017. Crude oil production in the United States totaled 50,489 barrels per day (which includes 1,134 barrels per day relating to noncontrolling interest) in 2018, up from 46,200 barrels per day in 2017. The increase in U.S. crude oil production year over year was primarily due to new drilling and the acquisition of properties relating to the MP GOM transaction. Crude oil volumes produced offshore Eastern Canada totaled 6,701 barrels per day in 2018, down from 8,091 barrels per day in the previous year. Crude oil production offshore Sarawak decreased from 12,674 barrels per day in 2017 to 11,942 barrels per day in 2018. Block K in Malaysia had crude oil production of 16,734 barrels per day in 2018, down from 20,312 barrels per day in 2017. Lower oil production in 2018 in Malaysia was primarily attributable to natural well decline at most fields.  

 The Company’s total crude oil and condensate production averaged 90,431 barrels per day in 2017, compared to 103,400 barrels per day in 2016 and 126,400 barrels per day in 2015. The 2017 crude oil production level was 13% below 2016. Crude oil production in the United States totaled 46,200 barrels per day in 2017, down from 48,230 barrels per day in 2016. The decrease in U.S. crude oil production year over year was primarily due to well decline and shut-ins due to weather events which was only partially offset by new drilling. Heavy crude oil production in Western Canada fell from 2,766 barrels per day in 2016 to 150 barrels per day in 2017, with the reduction attributable to the sale of Seal asset in January 2017. Crude oil volumes produced offshore Eastern Canada totaled 8,091 barrels per day in 2017, down from 8,737 barrels per day in the previous year. There was no synthetic crude oil production in Canada in 2017 compared to 4,637 barrels per day in 2016 due to the Company selling its 5% interest in Syncrude in June 2016. Crude oil production offshore Sarawak decreased from 13,365 barrels per day in 2016 to 12,674 barrels per day in 2017. Block K in Malaysia had crude oil production of 20,312 barrels per day in 2017, down from 24,619 barrels per day in 2016. Lower oil production in 2017 in Malaysia was primarily attributable to natural well decline at most fields.  

 The Company produced natural gas liquids (NGL) of 9,590 barrels per day in 2018, largely in line with 9,151 barrels per day produced in 2017. Eighty-one percent of the Company’s NGL production in 2018 was derived from the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford Shale areas in the U.S.   

 The Company’s NGL production of 9,151 barrels per day in 2017 was in line with 9,227 barrels per day produced in 2016. Eighty-five percent of the Company’s NGL production in 2017 was derived from the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford Shale areas in the U.S.   

 Worldwide sales of natural gas averaged 422.8 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2018 compared to 383.7 MMCF per day in 2017. The 2018 increase in natural gas sales volumes is attributable to an 18% increase in natural gas production in Canada, primarily in Tupper and Placid areas as well as increase in gas production in the Gulf of Mexico in U.S.   

 Worldwide sales of natural gas averaged 383.7 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2017 compared to 378.2 MMCF per day in 2016. The 2017 increase in natural gas sales volumes is attributable to 8% increase in natural gas production in Canada, primarily in Tupper and Placid areas, offset in part by lower gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford Shale areas in United States.

 Results of Operations (Contd.)  

 Corporate   

 2018 vs 2017  

 Corporate activities, which include interest income and expense, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains/losses on crude oil contracts and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, reported a net loss of $123.9 million in 2018 compared to a loss of $601.2 million in 2017. The $477.3 million favorable variance in 2018 was primarily due to a credit to income tax expense of $135.7 million primarily related to an IRS interpretation of the 2017 Tax Act (versus a charge in 2017 of $274.0 million), lower foreign exchange losses ($66.4 million), and income related to an Ecuador arbitration settlement ($26.0 million), partially offset by losses on crude contracts used to hedge price risk ($42.0 million) versus a loss in the prior period ($9.5 million), lower other tax credits ($18.2 million), and higher G&A expense ($6.9 million). Further, the 2017 period included a deferred tax charge of $65.2 million associated with the estimated tax consequence of future repatriation of Malaysian and Canadian earnings that were deemed no longer indefinitely invested.   

 2017 vs 2016  

 Net costs of Corporate activities in 2017 were unfavorable to 2016 by $458.4 million primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, foreign exchange losses and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower administrative expenses. The impact of the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a charge of $274.0 million principally as a result of a deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The after-tax effects of foreign currency exchange losses were $65.3 million in 2017, $117.6 million unfavorable to 2016. These effects arose due to transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective operations’ predominant functional currency. The foreign currency loss recognized in 2017 was mostly realized in Canada relating to an inter-company loan between foreign subsidiaries denominated in U.S. dollars. The Canadian operation’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. In Malaysia, net deferred tax assets and prepaid current income tax amounts reported in its balance sheet were revalued to the Malaysian operation’s functional currency of U.S. dollars. Interest expense of $181.8 million was $33.6 million higher in 2017 as a result of bonds issued in the third quarter 2017 for net proceeds of $541.0 million. Administrative expenses associated with corporate activities were lower in 2017 by $18.9 million, primarily due to a higher allocation of costs to the exploration and production businesses.   

 ﻿  

 Financial Condition  

 Cash Provided by Operating Activities  

 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,219.4 million in 2018 compared to $1,128.1 million in 2017. The $91.3 million improvement in cash provided by continuing operations activities in 2018 was primarily attributable to higher revenues from higher prices and higher volumes ($508.1 million), offset by higher cash taxes paid as a result of repatriating cash from Canada, current tax payments in Malaysia ($62.9 million), payments made on hedge (crude contracts to mitigate price risk) losses ($75.9 million). Changes in operating working capital from continuing operations decreased cash by $169.8 million during 2018, compared to increasing cash by $136.4 million in 2017.   

 Cash flow provided by continuing operations was $527.3 million higher in 2017 than in 2016 due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices, lower lease operating expenses and lower selling and general expenses. Also, 2016 included $266.6 million relating to payments for a deepwater rig contract exit.  

 The total reductions of operating cash flows for interest paid during the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $167.8 million, $147.9 million and $127.8 million, respectively.  

 Cash Used in Investing Activities  

 Cash used for property additions and dry holes, which includes amounts expensed, were $1,102.8 million and $1,009.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is due to higher development drilling activities in Eagle Ford Shale and Kaybob Duvernay. Cash used for acquisition of oil properties was $794.6 million, attributable to the MP GOM acquisition.

 A reconciliation of property additions and dry hole costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to total capital expenditures for continuing operations follows.  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Proceeds from sales of property and equipment generated cash of $1.4 million in 2018 compared to $69.5 million in 2017 primarily relating to the proceeds from the sale of the Seal field in Western Canada and the sale of certain non-core assets of Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas in 2017. Proceeds from sales of assets generated $1.16 billion in 2016 as a result of the sale of Syncrude and natural gas processing and sales pipeline assets that support natural gas fields in the Tupper area in Canada.   

 Cash Provided by and Use by Financing Activities  

 During 2018, the Company borrowed $325.0 million on its revolving credit facility to partially fund the MP GOM transaction.  

 During 2017 the Company issued $550 million notes in August 2017 that bear a rate of 5.75% and mature on August 15, 2025, for net proceeds of $541.6 million; these proceeds were used to redeem the Company’s $550 million 3.50% notes in September 2017. The 3.50% notes had a maturity date of December 2017 and were retired early.   

 During 2016, the Company borrowed $541.4 million by issuing 6.875% notes maturing in 2024. The Company used $600.0 million in cash during 2016 to repay long-term debt under its revolving credit facility.   

 Total cash dividends to shareholders amounted to $173.0 million in 2018, $172.6 million in 2017, and $206.6 million in 2016.

 Financial Condition (Contd.)  

 At the end of 2018, working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) amounted to $33.8 million (2017: $537.4 million). The total working capital decrease in 2018 is primarily attributable to lower cash (due to the MP GOM transaction, $469.6 million cash impact) and inventory balances offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.   

 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2018 totaled $387.4 million (2017: $965.0 million). The decrease in 2018 is primarily related to the use of cash on hand to fund the MP GOM acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017 totaled $965.0 million (2016: $872.8 million). The increase in 2017 was primarily related to the conversion of Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days to cash. Canadian government securities held at the end of 2016 totaled $111.5 million. These slightly longer-term Canadian investments were purchased in 2016 because of a tight supply of shorter-term securities available for purchase in Canada.   

 Cash and invested cash are maintained in several operating locations outside the United States. At December 31, 2018, Cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. included U.S dollar equivalents of approximately $175.1 million (2017:  $549.3 million) in Canada and $27.4 million (2017:  $334.6 million) in Malaysia. In addition, approximately $17.2 million of cash was held in the U.K. and has been classified as part of Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2018. In certain cases, the Company could incur cash taxes or other costs should these cash balances be repatriated to the U.S. in future periods. Canada currently collects a 5% withholding tax on any earnings repatriated to the U.S. See Note J of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding potential tax expense that could be incurred upon distribution of foreign earnings back to the United States.  

 At December 31, 2018, long-term debt of $3,227.1 million was $320.6 million higher than year-end 2017, principally as a result of borrowing on the revolving credit facility to partially fund the MP GOM acquisition ($325.0 million). Long-term debt at year-end 2017 was $483.8 million higher than year-end 2016, principally as a result of the issuance of $550 million notes in August 2017 that bear a rate of 5.75% and mature in August 2025. A summary of capital employed at December 31, 2018 and 2017 follows.

 Stockholders’ equity was $5.20 billion at the end of 2018 (2017: $4.62 billion; 2016: $4.92 billion). Stockholders’ equity increased in 2018 primarily due to net income earned and the addition of noncontrolling interest as part of the MP GOM transaction. Stockholders’ equity declined in 2017 primarily due to the net loss incurred and cash dividends paid on common stock. A summary of transactions in stockholders’ equity accounts is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity on page 59 of this Form 10-K report.  

 Other significant changes in Murphy’s balance sheet at the end of 2018, compared to 2017 are discussed below.  

 Deferred income tax assets increased $148.1 million to $359.6 million (2017: $211.5 million) principally as a result of the favorable 2018 IRS interpretation of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act which resulted in the reinstatement of deferred tax assets relating to 2017 net operating losses.   

 Deferred income tax liabilities decreased $29.2 million to $129.9 million (2017: $159.1 million) principally as a result of current year Canadian taxable profits utilizing prior taxable losses and the change from a U.S. net deferred tax liability position to a net deferred tax asset position, due to the 2018 IRS interpretation of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act.  

 Long-term asset retirement obligations increased $318.1 million to $1,027.4 million, principally due to increased obligations associated with the MP GOM transaction.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 37  

Financial Condition (Contd.)  

 Murphy had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately $383.1 million at December 31, 2018 (2017: $432.3 million). These commitments included $165.2 million for costs to develop deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico fields including new fields acquired as part of the MP GOM transaction, $103.0 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, $60.0 million for development at Kaybob Duvernay in Canada, $31.4 million for work at Eagle Ford Shale, $14.7 million for exploration cost in Mexico, and $8.8 million for future work commitments in Vietnam.  

 The primary sources of the Company’s liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company generally uses its internally generated funds to finance its capital and operating expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and will borrow as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2018, the Company has a $1.6 billion senior unsecured guaranteed credit facility (2018 facility) with a major banking consortium, which expires in November 2023.   

 At December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $325.0 million under the 2018 facility and $24.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the borrowing capacity of the 2018 facility. Borrowings under the 2018 facility bear interest at rates, based, at the Company’s option, on the “Alternate Base Rate” of interest in effect plus the “ABR Spread” or the “Adjusted LIBOR Rate,” which is a periodic fixed rate based on LIBOR with a term equivalent to the interest period for such borrowing, plus the “Eurodollar Spread.” The “Alternate Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The “Eurodollar Spread” ranges from 1.075% to 2.10% per annum based upon the Corporation’s senior unsecured long-term debt securities credit ratings (the “Credit Ratings”). A facility fee accrues and is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate ranging from 0.175% to 0.40% per annum (based upon the Company’s Credit Ratings) on the aggregate commitments under the 2018 facility. At December 31, 2018, the interest rate in effect on borrowings under the facility was 3.831%. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2018 facility.   

 Current financing arrangements are outlined in more detail in Note H to the consolidated financial statements.

 Environmental Matters  

 Murphy faces various environmental and safety risks that are inherent in exploring for, developing and producing hydrocarbons. To help manage these risks, the Company has established a robust health, safety and environmental governance program comprised of a worldwide policy, guiding principles, annual goals and a management system, with appropriate oversight at the business unit, senior leadership and board levels. The Company strives to minimize these risks by continually improving its processes through design, operation and maintenance, and through emergency and oil spill response planning to address any credible and major risks it identifies through impact assessments.  

 Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous international, national, state, provincial and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program, as well as its general and administrative budget, to comply with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations. These requirements affect virtually all operations of the Company and increase Murphy’s overall cost of business, including its capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities, and operating costs for ongoing compliance.  

 The principal environmental laws and regulations to which Murphy is subject address such matters as the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials, the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, wildlife, habitat and water protection and the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment. These laws and regulations also generally require permits for existing operations, as well as the construction or development of new operations. Any violation of applicable environmental laws, regulations or permits can give rise to significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, construction bans and delays, and other sanctions.   

 38  

 Environmental Matters (Contd.)  

 These laws, regulations and permits have been subject to frequent change and tend to become more stringent over time. The change in the federal administration creates uncertainty in future changes as well as the enforcement of existing laws and regulations. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has implemented requirements to reduce sulfur dioxide, a volatile organic compound and hazardous air pollutant air emissions from oil and gas operations, including standards for wells that are hydraulically fractured. Any current or future air emission or other environmental requirements applicable to Murphy’s businesses could curtail its operations or otherwise result in operational delays, liabilities and increased costs.  

 Certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates have required, or are considering requiring, more stringent permitting, chemical disclosure, transparency, water usage, disposal and well construction requirements. Regulators are also becoming increasingly focused on air emissions from the oil and gas industry, including volatile organic compound and methane emissions.  

 Murphy also could be subject to strict liability for environmental contamination, in various jurisdictions where we operate, including with respect to its current or former properties, operations and waste disposal sites, or those of its predecessors. Contamination has been identified at certain of such sites as a result of which the Company has been required and in the future may be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, clean up contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater, address spills and leaks from pipelines and production equipment, and perform remedial plugging operations. In addition to significant investigation and remediation costs, such matters can result in fines and also give rise to third-party claims for personal injury and property or other environmental damage.  

 In 2015, the Company’s subsidiary in Canada identified a leak or leaks at an infield condensate transfer pipeline at the Seal field in a remote area of Alberta. The pipeline was immediately shut down and the Company’s emergency response plan was activated. In cooperation with local governmental regulators, and with the assistance of qualified consultants, an investigation and remediation plan is progressing as planned and the Company’s insurers were notified. Based on the assessments done to date, the Company recorded $43.9 million in Other expense during 2015 and a further $3.8 million in 2018 associated with the estimated costs of remediating the site. The Company has spent $44.7 million from inception to December 31, 2018. Further refinements in the estimated total cost to remediate the site may occur in future periods. The Company retained the responsibility for this remediation upon sale of the Seal field in 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a remaining accrued liability of $3.0 million associated with this event.  In 2018, the Company received $25.0 million in respect to an insurance claim regarding this matter and the outcome of further insurance claims by the Company is pending.  

 ﻿  

 Climate Change  

 Murphy is currently required to report greenhouse gas emissions from certain of its operations and, in British Columbia and Alberta, is subject to a carbon tax on the purchase or use of many carbon-based fuels. Additionally, starting in 2017, a carbon tax applies to certain operations in Alberta. The Canadian Government has announced a proposal that all other provinces and territories implement some form of carbon pricing by 2018. Any limitation on or further regulation of, greenhouse gases (including through a cap and trade system) technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could restrict the Company’s operations, curtail demand for hydrocarbons generally and/or impose increased costs, including to operate and maintain facilities, install pollution emission controls and administer and manage emissions trading programs.  

 ﻿  

 Safety Matters  

 The Company is subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable foreign and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in Murphy’s operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with applicable safety requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping requirements and the monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.  

 39  

 Other Matters  

 Impact of inflation – General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Company’s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and/or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the future. Prices for oil field goods and services are usually affected by the worldwide prices for crude oil.   

 Following the drop in oil prices in late 2014, 2015-2016 experienced reduced demand for oil and gas materials and services, which led to downward pressure on the cost of these materials and services in 2015 and 2016. In 2017 and 2018, as oil and gas prices have moved higher, drilling activity has begun to increase, leading to upward pressure on the cost of oil and gas materials and services.  

 Natural gas prices are also affected by supply and demand, which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas.  

 As a result of the overall volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to predict the Company’s future cost of oil field goods and services.  

 Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements – see Note B  

 Significant accounting policies – In preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Company’s accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below.  

 Oil and gas proved reserves – Oil and gas proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire (unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain). Proved developed reserves of oil and gas can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

 Although the Company’s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require the Company to use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining quantities of proved reserves. These historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserves quantities.   

 ﻿  

 Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Reserves revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Company’s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. Downward reserves revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense. The Company cannot predict the type of oil and gas reserves revisions that will be required in future periods.   

 40  

 Other Matters (Contd.)  

 Significant accounting policies (contd.)  

 The Company’s proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are presented on pages 106 to 112 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy’s estimations for proved reserves were generated through the integration of available geoscience, engineering, and economic data, and commercially available technologies, to establish ‘reasonable certainty’ of economic producibility. As defined by the SEC, reasonable certainty of proved reserves describes a high-degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. In estimating proved reserves, Murphy uses familiar industry-accepted methods for subsurface evaluations, including performance, volumetric, and analog-based studies.   

 Where appropriate, Murphy includes reliable geologic and engineering technology to estimate proved reserves. Reliable geologic and engineering technology is a method or combination of methods that are field-tested and have demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. This integrated approach increases the quality of and confidence in Murphy’s proved reserves estimates, and was utilized in certain undrilled acreage at distances greater than the directly offsetting development spacing areas, and in certain reservoirs developed with the application of improved recovery techniques. Murphy utilized a combination of 3D seismic interpretation, core analysis, wellbore log measurements, well test data, historic production and pressure data, and commercially available seismic processing and numerical reservoir simulation programs. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to strengthen the reserves estimates when available.  

 See further discussion of proved reserves and changes in proved reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2018 beginning on pages 7 and 101 of this Form 10-K report.  

 ﻿  

 Property, Plant & Equipment - impairment of long-lived assets – The Company continually monitors its long-lived assets recorded in Property, plant and equipment (PPE) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its PPE for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows.   

 A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital, operating and abandonment costs, and future inflation levels.   

 The need to test a long-lived asset for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and/or natural gas, unfavorable revisions of oil or natural gas reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations, tax laws or other regulatory changes. All of these factors must be considered when evaluating a property’s carrying value for possible impairment.   

 Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been different from the Company’s projections.   

 Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available.   

 The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long-term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated.   

 In 2018, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $20.0 million to reduce the carrying value of select Midland properties to its net recoverable value.  

 The company did not record any impairment expense in 2017.  

 The Company recorded impairment expense of $95.1 million in 2016 to reduce the carrying value of producing heavy oil properties in Western Canada and the Terra Nova field offshore Canada to their estimated fair value due to significant declines in future oil prices in early 2016.   

 41  

 Other Matters (Contd.)  

 Significant accounting policies (contd.)  

 Property, Plant & Equipment – business combinations – The Company may acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the MP GOM transaction with PAI in 2018. In connection with a business combination, the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.   

 Significant assumptions are involved in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such as the fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. In most cases, sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties, and the Company prepares estimates of such properties based on the fair value of associated crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. The primary assumptions used to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows are reserves quantities, commodity prices, and capital and operating costs. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate determined at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk-weighting factors.   

 Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.  

 Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, Murphy reports 100% of the sales volumes, revenues, costs, assets and liabilities including the 20% noncontrolling interest (NCI), of the new Gulf of Mexico transaction (MP GOM) with Petrobras Americas Inc (PAI), in accordance with accounting for noncontrolling interest as prescribed by ASC 810-10-45.  

 ﻿  

 Income taxes – The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company and (d) changes to regulations may be subject to different interpretations and require future clarification from issuing authorities. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property, equipment and inventories, and liabilities for dismantlement and retirement benefit plan obligations and net deferred tax liabilities relating to U.S. basis differences for property equipment and inventories. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization.  

 In 2018, Murphy Oil’s net income included a favorable income tax adjustment of $135.7 million related to the 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The $135.7 million adjustment, primarily related to the reinstatement of a deferred tax asset for 2017 net operating losses, which in 2017, was assumed utilized against the deemed repatriation.   

 For the year ended December 31, 2017, Murphy recorded a tax expense of $274.0 million directly related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. The charge includes the impact of a deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

 ﻿  

 Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans – Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full-time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is estimated by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third-party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high-quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent   

 42  

single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long-term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near-term and long-term trends for medical and drug costs.

 Based on bond yields at December 31, 2018, the Company has used a weighted average discount rate of 4.4 % at year-end 2018 for the primary U.S. plans. This weighted average discount rate is 0.7% higher than prior year, which decreased the Company’s recorded liabilities for retirement plans compared to a year ago. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 6.0% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The Company’s retirement and postretirement plan expenses in 2019 are expected to be $1.7 million higher than 2018 primarily due to increased amortization of the interest cost component. Cash contributions are anticipated to be $4.8 million higher in 2019. In 2018, the Company paid $24.5 million into various retirement plans and $3.1 million into postretirement plans. In 2019, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $27.3 million into various retirement plans and $5.1 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected.   

 As described above, the Company’s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2019 annual retirement expenses by $2.0 million and decrease postretirement expenses by $0.3 million; and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2018 retirement expense by $2.4 million.  

 Legal, environmental and other contingent matters – A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, management’s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law. The Company’s management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company.  

 ﻿  

 Contractual obligations and guarantees – The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure plans, and other long-term liabilities. Total payments due after 2018 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown in the table below.  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 ﻿

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields. In addition, the Company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Company’s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above.  

 In 2013, the Company entered, along with its partners, into a 25-year lease for a semi-floating production system at the Kakap field offshore Sabah, Malaysia. The Company has included the required net lease obligations for this production system as Debt in the contractual obligation table above.  

 In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. Total outstanding letters of credit were $181.2 million as of December 31, 2018.  

 43  

Material off-balance sheet arrangements – The Company occasionally utilizes lease arrangements for operational or funding purposes where the commitment may not be recorded on the balance sheet. The most significant of these arrangements at year-end 2017 included operating leases of floating, production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) for the Kikeh and Cascade/Chinook oil fields, drilling contracts for onshore and offshore rigs in various countries, and oil and/or natural gas transportation and processing contracts in the U.S. and Western Canada. The leases call for future monthly net lease payments through 2022 at Kikeh. The U.S. transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through 2024, while Western Canada processing contracts call for minimum monthly payments through 2035. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table above. In February 2016, FASB issued an ASU to increase transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company anticipates adopting this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and is currently analyzing its portfolio of contracts to assess the impact future adoption of this ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

 Outlook  

 Prices for the Company’s primary products are often quite volatile. The price of crude oil is primarily affected by the levels of supply and demand for energy. Anticipated future variances between the predicted demand for crude oil and the projected available supply can lead to significant movement in the price of crude oil. In January 2019, West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged about $51.55 for the month and averaged $54.45 in the first three weeks of February. NYMEX natural gas averaged $3.07 during January 2019. Both of these oil and natural gas prices are below the average prices achieved in 2018. The Company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending plans based on these prices.  

 The Company’s capital expenditure budget for 2019 is expected to be between $1.25 and $1.45 billion (excluding noncontrolling interest of $48 million). Capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during 2019 and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases or sales, which often are not anticipated at the time a budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2019 using operating cash flow and available cash, but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities. If oil and/or natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that further capital spending reductions are required and/or borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Company’s ongoing development projects.  

 The Company currently expects average daily production in 2019 to be between 215,000 and 223,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (including noncontrolling interest of 13,000 BOEPD).   

 The Company has entered into natural gas forward delivery contracts to manage risk associated with certain Canadian natural gas sales prices as follows:
