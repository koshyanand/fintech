Item 1A. Risk Factors

Described below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. 

The oil and gas industry is cyclical and crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. A reduction in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our operations, our liquidity, and the price of our common stock. 

Our ability to operate profitably, maintain adequate liquidity, grow our cash flow and pay dividends or repurchase our common stock depend upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, NGL and natural gas production. Commodity prices are cyclical and subject to global supply and demand dynamics. 

A prolonged or substantial decline in commodity prices, including declines in commodity forward price curves or volatility in location-basis differentials, may have the following effects on our business:

•reduction of our revenues, profit margins, operating income and cash flows;

•reduction in the amount of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically, leading to shut-in or early abandonment of producing wells, including low-margin US onshore wells, and increased capital requirements for abandonment operations;

•certain properties in our portfolio becoming economically unviable;

•impairments of proved or unproved properties or other long-lived assets;

•use of cash flow to satisfy minimum obligations under throughput agreements if production is suspended;

•reduction, or suspension, of our future capital investment programs, resulting in a reduced ability to develop or replace our reserves;

•delay, postponement or cancellation of some of our exploration or development projects;

•inability to meet exploration or continuous drilling commitments, leading to loss of leases or exploration rights;

•loss of undeveloped acreage if we are unable to make scheduled delay rental payments or loss of developed acreage if our production is shut-in;

•divestments of properties to generate funds to meet cash flow or liquidity requirements;

•limitations on our financial condition, liquidity, including access to sources of capital, such as debt and equity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations; 

•failure of our partners to fund their share of development costs or obtain financing, which could result in delay or cancellation of future projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows;

•inability to meet scheduled interest and/or debt payments or payments due under operating or capital leases;

•a series of credit rating downgrades or other negative rating actions, which could increase our future cost of financing and may increase our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain other contracts, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our liquidity and our ability to access the commercial paper market;

25
Index to Financial Statements

•changes in corporate structure that could lead to loss of key personnel and interrupt our business activities;

•reduction or suspension of dividends or repurchases of our common stock;

•declines in our stock price;

•additional counterparty credit risk exposure on commodity hedges and joint venture receivables; and

•a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.

Our commodity price hedging arrangements in place will not fully mitigate the effects of price volatility and may also curtail benefits from future increases in commodity prices. 

Markets and prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control, factors including, among others:

•global demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as impacted by economic factors that affect gross domestic product growth rates of countries around the world; 

•global supply for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as impacted by OPEC and non-OPEC countries (e.g. US, Russia, Canada); 

•technology advances that increase crude oil, NGL and natural gas production, thereby increasing supply;

•new technologies that promote fuel efficiency or fuel efficiency regulations, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, and impact demand for crude oil as a transportation fuel and reduce energy consumption;

•the price and availability of alternative fuels and battery storage and the long-term impact on the crude oil market of the use of natural gas and electricity as an alternative fuel for road transportation or the use of natural gas as fuel for electricity generation impacting the demand for electricity;

•developments in the global LNG market, including exports from the US;

•geopolitical conditions and events, including generational leadership or regime changes, changes in government energy policies, including imposed price controls and/or product subsidies, the impact of trade embargoes or imposed tariffs, or instability/armed conflict in hydrocarbon-producing regions;

•fluctuations in exchange rates of the US dollar, the currency in which the world's crude oil trade is generally denominated;

•periods when production surpasses local pipeline/rail transportation and/or refining capacity, as is currently the case in the Delaware Basin, which in turn results in transportation constraints and significant discounts to our realized prices;

•the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;

•the effectiveness of worldwide conservation measures;

•weather conditions;

•access to government-owned and other lands for exploration and production activities; and

•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.

Sector cost inflation could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.

Our industry is cyclical and third-party oilfield equipment materials and service costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. During periods of decreasing levels of industry exploration and production, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services decreases. Conversely, during periods of increasing levels of industry activity, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increases. As a result, drilling rigs and oilfield services may not be available at rates that provide a satisfactory return on our investment. 

As commodity prices have strengthened, the demand for oilfield services and infrastructure, particularly in US onshore basins, has risen, leading to cost inflation for the drilling, completion and operating of wells, and for the construction and/or access to necessary oil and gas infrastructure, including access to gathering facilities, transportation and/or takeaway pipelines driven by growing production volumes. Transportation bottlenecks or infrastructure limitations caused by the increased utilization may lead to competitive pricing pressures in certain basins. As a result, there is pressure on operating margins and capital efficiency in US onshore basins, including those in which we operate. 

If this trend continues, and if commodity prices increase, we expect industry exploration and production activities to continue to increase, resulting in even higher demand for oilfield equipment services, which could result in significant sector price inflation. In addition, in basins of relatively higher activity, scarcity of competent service personnel may impact our ability to execute our exploration and development plans in a timely and profitable manner. 

Concentration of capital in, and production and cash flows from, certain operations may increase our exposure to risks enumerated herein. 

A significant portion of our production and revenues is highly concentrated and is generated from a limited number of conventional deepwater wells. These wells, located offshore Israel and offshore Equatorial Guinea, contributed approximately 20% of our 2018 total crude oil, NGL and natural gas revenues and 26% of our 2018 total consolidated sales volumes. In 

26
Index to Financial Statements

addition, we have a major concentration of reserves offshore Israel, with approximately 43% of our year-end 2018 proved reserves attributable to this area. 

Although we carry contingent business interruption insurance for these producing assets, as well as other insurance, the insurance is insufficient to cover all potential risks.

We also have significant concentrations of capital and production in unconventional basins including the DJ Basin, Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, and we expect to invest approximately 70% of our total capital investment program to development activities in these areas in 2019. Restrictions in land access or permitting, rapid changes in drilling and completion technology, significant increases in drilling and completion costs, lack of availability of downstream services, including access to gathering facilities, transportation and/or takeaway pipelines, lack of reliable power or electricity infrastructure, changes in regulations and other risks impacting these areas, as enumerated in certain risk factors described herein, can have immediate, significant negative impacts on our production, cash flows, profitability and financial position.

We face various risks associated with the trend toward increased anti-oil and gas development activity. 

In recent years, we have seen significant growth in opposition to oil and gas development both in the US and globally. 

Companies in our industry can be the target of opposition to hydrocarbon development from stakeholder groups, including national, state and local governments, regulatory agencies, non-government organizations and public citizens. This opposition is focused on attempting to limit or stop hydrocarbon development in certain areas. Examples of such opposition include: efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites; delaying or denying air-quality permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity; and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm. 

We have experienced these efforts in Colorado, recently and in the past, and it is likely they will continue into the future. For example, the State of Colorado General Assembly is currently developing a framework for future oil and gas development in the State. This initiative, together with increased pressure to allow local governments to control oil and gas operations within their borders, could result in new regulations that limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or other facets of crude oil and natural gas exploration or development in areas where we operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these initiatives or their impact on our operations.

Recent efforts by the US Administration to modify federal oil and gas related regulations could intensify the risk of anti-development efforts from grass roots opposition. 

Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these anti-development efforts, including legal challenges, or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.

The production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future crude oil, NGL and natural gas production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing fields, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or gaining access to properties containing future proved reserves. Consequently, our future crude oil, NGL and natural gas production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. 

The marketability of our production is dependent upon access to gathering, transportation and processing facilities, which we may not own or control.

The marketability of our production from our US onshore areas depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems, transportation pipelines, rail service, and processing facilities. We deliver crude oil, NGLs and natural gas produced from these areas through midstream infrastructure, the majority of which we do not own and may not control. 

We currently rely on state-owned pipeline and transportation systems to deliver our natural gas production from offshore Israel to customers and end users in the region. In addition, with the execution of multiple agreements to supply natural gas to customers in Egypt, we have entered into an agreement to acquire an equity interest in a company that owns the EMG Pipeline, which will connect the Israel pipeline network to Egyptian customers. Initial gas delivery through the EMG Pipeline is expected to occur in 2019 and is pending certain conditions precedent. Offshore Equatorial Guinea, our natural gas production is delivered to onshore processing and storage facilities operated by our partner, and the resulting products, as well as our crude oil production from Aseng and Alen, are lifted to tankers owned by third-parties.

27
Index to Financial Statements

Third-party systems and facilities may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. In addition, the lack of availability of, or capacity on, third-party systems and facilities, including those owned by Noble Midstream Partners, could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Further, the inability of third-party processors, over whom we have no control, to meet anticipated facility expansion deadlines, or to delay or even cancel projects, in areas where our production is growing, such as in the DJ Basin, could result in curtailment of our production growth and/or shut-in of production. Even where we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reliability or other reasons, including adverse weather conditions or geopolitical instability.

Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay or curtail production, thereby harming our business and, in turn, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments or by violent acts such as civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts. 

We have significant international operations in Israel and Equatorial Guinea. We also conduct exploration activities in other international areas. Notwithstanding economic stability clauses, our operations may be adversely affected by economic or political developments, including the following:

•renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts, which may occur pursuant to future regulations enacted as a result of changes in Israel's antitrust, export and natural gas development policies, or the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of Equatorial Guinea, which can increase the amount of revenues that the host government receives from production (government take) or otherwise decrease project profitability;

•loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of actions taken by host nations, such as expropriation or nationalization of assets or termination of contracts; 

•changes in drilling or safety regulations;

•laws and policies of the US and foreign jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, taxation and business conduct;

•potential for Israel natural gas production and regional exports to be interrupted by political conditions and events;

•difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;

•US and international monetary policies impacting foreign exchange or repatriation restrictions in countries in which we conduct business; and

•other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which we conduct operations.

Such economic and political developments could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the fair values of our properties, resulting in impairment charges. 

In addition, our international operations are located in, or in close proximity to, regions that continue to experience varying degrees of political instability, public protests, territorial or boundary disputes, and terrorist attacks. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the regions in which we operate could result in curtailment of our operations. In the event that such regions experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in areas where such unrest leads to regime change, our operations there could be materially impaired. 

We monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact. 

Civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others: 

•increased volatility in global crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;

•negative impact on the global crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility; 

•difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;

•inability of our personnel, third-party providers or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we conduct operations;

•disruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;

•inability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;

•reduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;

28
Index to Financial Statements

•damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;

•damage to or destruction of property belonging to our purchasers, leading to interruption of commodity deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;

•lack of availability of drilling rigs, oilfield equipment or services if third-party providers decide to exit the region;

•shutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and

•capital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.

Loss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks. 

Our Eastern Mediterranean discoveries bear certain technical, geopolitical, regulatory, and financial challenges that could adversely impact our ability to monetize these natural gas assets. 

Due to the scale of our Leviathan (Israel) and Aphrodite (Cyprus) discoveries, realization of their full economic value depends on our ability to execute successful phased development scenarios, the failure or delay of which could reduce our future growth and have negative effects on our future operating results. Offshore projects of this magnitude entail significant technical complexities, including subsea tiebacks to a FPSO or production platform, pressure maintenance systems, gas re-injection systems, onshore receiving terminals, or other specialized infrastructure. In addition, we depend on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events related to these projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

We have entered into and are currently negotiating various long-term GSPAs for our Eastern Mediterranean natural gas assets. Some of these agreements require the export of natural gas from either Israel or Cyprus to other countries in the region, such as Egypt and Jordan. These agreements are subject to a variety of risks, including geopolitical, regulatory, financial and other uncertainties. War, political violence, civil unrest or lack of intergovernmental cooperation could affect both our and our counterparties’ abilities to cooperate and to perform under these agreements, and could potentially lead to a breach or termination of such agreements. In addition, economic conditions or financial duress of our counterparties could jeopardize their ability to fulfill their payment obligations under these contracts. Furthermore, if material disruptions occur, including events or circumstances constituting force majeure under contract provisions, such that they inhibit us or our counterparties from performing under these GSPAs, or our counterparties are unable to pay us for a sustained period of time, we could incur a significant decline in revenues. While the State of Israel continues to maintain its ability to generate electricity via coal-fired power plants, as they transition from coal-fired power plants to natural gas-fired power plants, it is becoming more dependent on us and our partners for its source of natural gas supply. Any material disruption in our ability to deliver natural gas to the State of Israel could have a material impact on our expected profitability, financial performance and reputation.

A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

We are increasingly dependent on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including suppliers, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activities in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and shale, as well as technologies supporting midstream operations and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.

As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks due to their critical role in operations.

Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.

A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:

•unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;

29
Index to Financial Statements

•data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;

•data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;

•a cyber attack on a supplier or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt a development project, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;

•a cyber attack on a third-party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;

•a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;

•a cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;

•a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;

•a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data, or data theft, could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and

•business interruptions, including use of social engineering schemes and/or ransomware, could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.

Our implementation of various controls and processes to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.

We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may restrict our access to land and/or cause us to incur substantial incremental costs. 

Our industry is subject to complex laws and regulations adopted or promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. As the various government and/or regulatory bodies issue or rescind various regulations, our operations are subject to significant volatility in response to the issuance, interpretation and application of these regulations.

Examples of factors which reduce our land access, including loss of access to land for which we own mineral rights, reduced ability to obtain new leases, or loss of rights granted under surface use agreements, rights-of-way, surface leases or other easement rights, include, among others:

•new municipal, state or federal land use regulations, which may restrict drilling locations or certain activities such as hydraulic fracturing;

•local and municipal government control of land or zoning requirements, which can conflict with state law and deprive land owners of property development rights;

•landowner, community and/or governmental opposition to infrastructure development;

•regulation of federal and Indian land by the BLM; and

•the presence of threatened or endangered species or of their habitat.

In the state of Colorado, for example, since 2014 we have encountered citizen driven ballot initiatives and other legislative proposals to regulate, limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or other facets of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development or operations. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations – Colorado.

Changes in price controls, taxes and environmental laws relating to our industry also have the ability to substantially affect crude oil, NGL and natural gas production, operations and economics. Environmental laws, in particular, can change frequently, often become stricter and at times may force us to incur additional costs as changes are implemented.

Under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Additionally, the accidental and/or unpermitted discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities on our part to government agencies and/or third parties, and may require us to incur 

30
Index to Financial Statements

costs to achieve remediation objectives and/or requirements. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies – Colorado Air Matter.

Noncompliance with existing or future legislation or regulations could potentially result in an increased risk of civil or criminal fines or sanctions. Fines or sanctions associated with a well incident or spill could well exceed the actual cost of containment and cleanup. In addition, we cannot always predict with certainty how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.

Restricted land access, further expansion of environmental, safety and performance regulations or an increase in liability for drilling or production activities, including punitive fines, may have one or more of the following impacts on our business:

•reduce our proved reserves;

•reduce our ability to explore for new proved reserves;

•increase exploratory and development well drilling costs, operating or other costs;

•delay, or preclude, project development resulting in longer development cycle times;

•disrupt or prohibit our ability to construct or operate midstream assets;

•divert our cash flows from capital investments in order to maintain liquidity;

•increase or remove liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills;

•increase our share of civil or criminal fines or sanctions for actual or alleged violations if a well incident were to occur; and

•limit our ability to obtain additional insurance coverage, at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, to protect against any increase in liability.

Any of the above operating or financial factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and may result in a reduction of the fair value of our properties or reduce our financial flexibility. Because we strive to achieve certain levels of return on our projects, an increase in our financial responsibility could result in certain of our planned projects becoming uneconomic. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations.

Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes and related government policies, tax laws and regulations in the US and other countries in which we operate.

Fiscal regimes impact oil and gas companies through laws and regulations governing resource access, along with government participation in oil and gas projects, royalties and taxes. We operate in the US and other countries whose fiscal regimes may change over time. Changes in fiscal regimes result in an increase or decrease in the amount of government financial take from developments, and a corresponding decrease or increase in the revenues of an oil and gas company operating in that particular country. For example, a significant portion of our production comes from Israel and Equatorial Guinea; therefore, changes in or uncertainties related to the fiscal regimes or energy policies of these countries could delay or reduce the profitability of our development projects, and/or render future exploration and development projects uneconomic. 

The elimination of tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-US taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could also have a significant impact on our operations and financial performance. For example, on December 22, 2017, the US Congress enacted tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Legislation). The Tax Reform Legislation is complex and far-reaching, making sweeping modifications to the Internal Revenue Code including a lower corporate tax rate, changes to credits and deductions, and a move to a territorial system for corporations that have overseas earnings. 

Periodically, other legislative amendments may be proposed that, if enacted into law, would make additional significant changes to US federal and state income tax laws, such as (i) the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs and (ii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future, or the timing of any such action. Further, we cannot predict how government agencies or courts will interpret existing regulations and tax laws, including Tax Reform Legislation, or the effect such interpretations could have on our business.

Changes in fiscal regimes, including changes in tax laws and regulations, have long-term impacts on our business strategy, and fiscal uncertainty makes it difficult to formulate and execute capital investment programs. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations increasing the tax costs on our business could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations and our stock price in the following ways, among others: 

•restrict resource access or investment in lease holdings;

•limit or cancel exploration and/or development activities, which could have a long-term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth; 

•negatively impact our and/or our partners' ability to obtain financing;

•reduce the profitability of our projects, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flows with the potential to make future investments uneconomical;

31
Index to Financial Statements

•result in currently producing projects becoming uneconomic, to the extent fiscal changes are retroactive, thereby reducing the amount of proved reserves we record and cash flows we receive, and possibly resulting in asset impairment charges;

•require that valuation allowances be established against deferred tax assets, with offsetting increases in income tax expense, resulting in decreases in net income and cash flow; and/or

•restrict our ability to compete with imported volumes of crude oil or natural gas.

A change in international and/or US federal and state climate policy could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Domestic and international responses to climate and related energy issues are matters of public policy consideration. We are currently in a period of increasing uncertainty as to these matters and, at this time, it is difficult to anticipate how the current US Administration, or other entities, may act on existing or new laws and regulations. As compared with certain large multi-national, integrated energy companies, we do not conduct fundamental research regarding the scientific inquiry of climate change. However, we will continue to closely monitor all relevant developments in this regard. Changes in international, federal or state laws and regulations regarding climate policy could have a significant negative impact on our ability to explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources or reduce demand for our products.

In recent years, international, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The EPA has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the US Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of states in the US have taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. For a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations, see Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations.

Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or other entities may make claims against us for alleged personal injury, property damage, or other potential liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Additionally, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, drought and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. 

Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and/or impair our ability to do business. 

Our operations require us to comply with complex and frequently-changing US and international laws and regulations, such as those involving anti-corruption, competition and antitrust, anti-boycott, anti-money laundering, import-export control, marketing, environmental and/or taxation.

For example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws and regulations generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. We conduct some of our operations in developing countries that have relatively underdeveloped legal and regulatory systems compared to more developed countries. These countries generally are perceived as presenting an increased risk of corruption. Additionally, certain of our operations involve the use of agents and other intermediaries whose conduct and actions could be imputed to us by anti-corruption enforcement authorities. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial fines or sanctions and impair our ability to do business. 

The import/export of equipment and supplies necessary for oil and gas exploration and development activities, as well as the export of crude oil, liquids and natural gas production are regulated by the import/export laws of the US and other countries in which we operate. In the US, certain items required for oil and gas development activities may be considered “dual-use”, having both commercial and military applications and, therefore, may be subject to specific import or export restrictions. In addition, the US government imposes economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries and regimes. The sanctions are based on US foreign policy and national security goals and may change over time.

As a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations. See We are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental 

32
Index to Financial Statements

requirements that may restrict our access to land and/or cause us to incur substantial incremental costs, above, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies. 

Federal, state and local hydraulic fracturing and water disposal legislation and regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce crude oil, NGLs and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities.

While hydraulic fracturing has been utilized in oil and gas development for decades, certain parties have called for further study of the technique's alleged environmental and health effects, for additional regulation of the technique and, in some cases, for a moratorium or ban on the use of hydraulic fracturing. Because of elevated public sensitivity around the topic, federal, state and local governments are continually conducting studies, evaluating their regulatory programs and considering additional requirements on and regulation of hydraulic fracturing practices. At the national level, proposals have been introduced from time to time in the US Congress that, if implemented, would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation, thereby limiting its use or increasing its cost. 

Federal agencies addressing hydraulic fracturing under existing authorities include the EPA and the BLM, under the US Department of the Interior. In 2017, an executive order was signed directing the EPA and the BLM to review their rules and, if appropriate, initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. Accordingly, the EPA and the BLM have taken actions to delay or rescind certain requirements related to hydraulic fracturing activities. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Hydraulic Fracturing.

Each of the states, as well as certain localities, where we operate have adopted or may adopt regulations on drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For example, a number of local communities in Colorado have attempted to increase regulatory requirements on crude oil and natural gas development. In addition, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for potential induced seismicity with regard to the operation of injection wells used for waste disposal. 

Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the US Department of Energy, the US Geological Survey, and the US Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.

We are dependent on the use of hydraulic fracturing practices to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas, particularly from wells in our US onshore basins. Additional federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, water disposal or other drilling activities that may be imposed in areas where we conduct business, such as US onshore, could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs, as well as delay or halt our ability to develop crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations and – Hydraulic Fracturing.

Exploration, development and production activities carry inherent risk. These activities, as well as natural disasters or adverse weather conditions, could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues.

Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, including:

•pipeline ruptures and spills;

•fires, explosions, blowouts and well cratering;

•equipment malfunctions and/or mechanical failure on high-volume, high-impact wells;

•malfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil, NGL and natural gas operations;

•leaks or spills occurring during the transfer of hydrocarbons from an FPSO to an oil tanker;

•loss of product occurring as a result of transfer to a truck or rail car or train derailments;

•leakage or loss of access to hydrocarbons resulting from formations with abnormal pressures and basin subsidence;

•release of pollutants; and

•spills, leaks or discharges of fluids used in or produced in the course of operations, especially those that reach surface water or groundwater.

33
Index to Financial Statements

Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, causing the loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our projects. In addition, our ability to deliver product pursuant to long-term supply contracts could be negatively impacted, resulting in additional financial exposure in the event we cannot fully deliver the contract quantities.

Any of these risks or hazards can result in injuries and/or deaths of employees, supplier personnel or other individuals, loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others, regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties or restricted access to our properties.

In addition, our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in the areas we operate including:

•hurricanes, tropical storms, windstorms, or “superstorms,” which could affect our operations in areas such as Texas; 

•winter storms and snow, which could affect our operations in the DJ Basin;

•extremely high temperatures, which could affect our midstream or third-party gathering and processing facilities in the DJ Basin and Texas;

•severe droughts, which could result in new restrictions on water usage in the DJ Basin and Texas;

•harsh weather and rough seas offshore international locations, which could limit exploration activities; and

•other natural disasters.

Any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others, or restricted access to our properties.

Development drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional or conventional resources.

We depend on development projects to provide sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns. However, development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time.

In new development areas, including certain shale formations, available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or the best locations for drilling development wells. Therefore, a development well we drill, or in which we participate, may be a dry hole, may result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons or may be less productive than our initial estimates.

We expect to invest significant amounts of capital to continue development of our US onshore unconventional resources and to progress the development of the Leviathan field project. In unconventional basins, development is highly dependent on costs of equipment and services, the use of technologies to drive capital and cost efficiencies in drilling and completion, and the availability of and access to midstream infrastructure. Even if development drilling is successful and we find commercial quantities of reserves, we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing development wells. For example, frontier areas or less developed onshore areas may not have adequate infrastructure for gathering, transportation or processing, and production may be delayed until such infrastructure is constructed. 

Exploratory drilling subjects us to risks and may not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs. 

Exploratory drilling requires significant capital investment and does not always result in commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or new development projects. In addition, exploratory drilling activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or development plans may change, resulting in significant exploration expense, as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions and pressure or other irregularities in formations. Furthermore, remote locations may make it more difficult and time-consuming to transport personnel, equipment and supplies, and we may face more difficult environments, such as oil sands, deepwater, or ultra-deepwater, in our efforts to seek new reserves, and may need to develop or invest in new technologies. These operating environments, and potential for harsh weather, increase cost as well as drilling risk.

Exploratory dry holes can occur because seismic data and other technologies we use to determine potential exploratory drilling locations do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. In addition, a well may be successful in locating hydrocarbons, but we and our partners may decide not to develop the prospect due to other considerations. 

In addition, for certain capital-intensive offshore projects, it may take several years to evaluate the future potential of an exploratory well and make a determination of its economic viability, resulting in delays in cash flows from production start-up and a lower return on our investment.

We hold working interests in certain areas, including offshore areas of Cyprus, Cameroon, Gabon and Newfoundland (Canada) where there is minimal or no crude oil, NGL or natural gas production, and in certain cases, limited infrastructure. If commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are discovered, areas with minimal or no current production must begin to address topics such as sector regulation and distribution of government proceeds from hydrocarbon sales, the results of which could 

34
Index to Financial Statements

have a negative impact on our business. We may not be able to compensate for or fully mitigate these risks. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs and Undeveloped Leasehold Costs.

Failure to adequately fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties.

Our exploration, development, and acquisition activities require capital expenditures to achieve production and cash flows. In particular, major offshore projects have a multi-year long development cycle time, which means that development spending occurs for several years before the project begins producing hydrocarbons and generating cash flows. As examples, assets and infrastructure for export of natural gas from Leviathan require a multi-billion dollar investment prior to production startup. Furthermore, while our DJ Basin assets are primarily held by production, other assets, such as our Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin properties, are held primarily through continuous development obligations. Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas, the amount of which could be substantial, or exercise options with land owners to extend leases. Failure to meet continuous development obligations or to exercise lease extensions may result in loss of leases.

Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our Revolving Credit Facility (defined below), debt and equity issuances, and occasional sales of assets. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of variables, as enumerated herein. If commodity prices decline for an extended period of time, we will evaluate our level of capital spending and likely reduce our investment program. As a result, we will have less ability to replace our reserves through drilling operations and may elect to forfeit our ownership interests or rights to participate in some properties, resulting in lower production over time as compared with prior years. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Operating Outlook – 2019 Capital Investment Program.

Our Midstream reportable segment derives a substantial portion of its revenue from unaffiliated, third party customers. If any of these customers changes its business strategy, alters current drilling and development plans on dedicated acreage, or otherwise significantly reduces the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, produced water or fresh water with respect to which we perform midstream services, our Midstream revenues would decline and have negative impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We have numerous commercial agreements to provide midstream services and crude oil sales for unaffiliated third-party customers, some of whom are non-investment grade. Accordingly, because we derive a substantial portion of our midstream revenue from these commercial agreements, we are subject to the operational and business risks of these customers, the most significant of which include the following:

•a reduction in or slowing of customer drilling and development plans on our dedicated acreage, which would directly and adversely impact demand for our midstream services;

•the volatility of crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, which could have a negative effect on our customers’ drilling and development plans on our dedicated acreage or ability to finance their operations and drilling and completion costs on our dedicated acreage;

•the availability of capital on an economic basis for our customers to fund their exploration and development activities;

•drilling and operating risks associated with customer operations on our dedicated acreage;

•downstream processing and transportation capacity constraints and interruptions, including the failure of our customers to have sufficient contracted processing or transportation capacity; and

•adverse effects of increased or changed governmental and environmental regulation or enforcement of existing regulation.

Further, we have no control over our customers’ business decisions and operations, and our customers are under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that is favorable to us. Thus, we are subject to the risk of cancellation of planned development, breach of commitments with respect to future dedications, and other non-payment or non-performance by our customers, including with respect to our commercial agreements, which do not contain minimum volume commitments. 

Our ability to produce crude oil, NGLs and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.

Drilling and development activities require the use of water and results in the production of waste water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process, which we employ to produce commercial quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas from many reservoirs, requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. In those cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the development cost. Waste water from oil and gas operations often is disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes or induced seismicity in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to increased public scrutiny of injection safety.

Index to Financial Statements

The development of new environmental initiatives or regulations related to acquisition, withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater, or treatment and discharge of water waste, may limit our ability to use techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, increase our development and operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted and all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Hydraulic Fracturing.

A negative shift in investor sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise debt and equity capital.

Certain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas and related infrastructure projects. 

Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting our future financial results.

We face various risks associated with global populism and general political uncertainty.

Following the 2008/2009 global financial crisis, the world has experienced lower economic growth versus the levels attained in previous decades. Recent trade tensions and tariff disputes, including retaliation to such policies which have the potential to escalate into global trade wars, have also contributed to a slowing of global trade activities further compounding concerns around jobs, economic well-being and wealth distribution. Globally, certain individuals and organizations are attempting to focus the public's attention on income and wealth distribution and implement income and wealth redistribution policies.

Recent events have intensified these risks. Globally, and in the US, the growing trends toward populism and political polarization have resulted in uncertainty regarding potential changes in regulations, fiscal policy, social programs, domestic and foreign relations and international trade policies and tariffs. 

Changes in relationships among the US, China and Russia, and/or among China, Russia and other countries, have potentially significant impacts on the global balance of power, as well as on global trade, with resultant impacts on both global and local economies. In addition, changes in the relationship between the US and its neighbors is currently impacting commerce and trade across the North American continent. In Europe, the populist movement has resulted in the Brexit vote and increasing populist demands coupled with rising nationalism could have a negative impact on economic policy and consequently pose a potential threat to economic growth as well as the unity of the European Union. 

Trade and/or tariff disputes could result in increased costs or shortages of materials and supplies the oil and gas industry relies on to produce, process and transport its oil and gas production. Our ability to respond to these developments or comply with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements, including those involving economic and trade sanctions, could reduce our ability to negotiate the sale of our products, increase our costs of doing business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations. 

Indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. 

At December 31, 2018, we had $6.6 billion of consolidated debt, of which $560 million relates to Noble Midstream Partners, and indebtedness represented 39% of our total book capitalization (sum of debt plus shareholders' equity).

Indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following:

•a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; 

•we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt;

•a covenant contained in our Credit Agreement provides that our total debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) may not exceed 65% at any time, which may make additional borrowings more expensive, thereby affecting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and our industry; 

•additional future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants; and

•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.

We may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our financial flexibility may deteriorate. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and service 

36
Index to Financial Statements

our debt depends on future performance. General economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors may affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. 

In addition, a downgrade or other negative rating action could affect our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as pipeline transportation contracts, crude oil and natural gas sales contracts, work commitments and certain abandonment obligations. A lowering of our debt credit rating may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and/or availability of future financing, including access to the commercial paper market, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our Revolving Credit Facility. These actions, in turn, could result in negative impacts on our business, financial condition and liquidity. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 9. Long-Term Debt. 

We face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources.

We operate in highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development, acquisition and production. We face intense competition from various types of competitors ranging from large multi-national, integrated oil and gas companies, to state-controlled national oil companies, to independent oil and gas companies, to privately backed oil and gas equity funds, to name a few.

We also face competition in a number of areas such as:

•acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;

•acquiring or increasing access to gathering, transportation and processing services and capacity;

•marketing our crude oil, NGL and natural gas production;

•acquiring the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and

•attracting and retaining employees with certain skills.

Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. Such companies may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. This highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Competition.

Estimates of crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves are not precise. 

Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves quantities and their value, including factors that are beyond our control. 

In accordance with the SEC's rules for oil and gas reserves reporting, our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average commodity prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. As estimated production, development and abandonment costs are based on year-end economic conditions, reserves quantities will also change when these costs increase or decrease.

Reserves estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:

•historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;

•assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including the SEC;

•anticipated development cycle time;

•future development costs; 

•future operating and abandonment costs;

•impacts of cost recovery provisions in contracts with foreign governments;

•severance and excise taxes; and

•workover and remedial costs.

For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different petroleum engineers, or by the same petroleum engineers but at different times, may vary substantially. Estimation of crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves in emerging areas or areas with limited historical production is inherently more difficult, and we may have less experience in such areas. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to positive or negative revisions, and actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. Any such negative revisions could result in an asset impairment charge.

37
Index to Financial Statements

Additionally, some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, which involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. Reserves estimates using volumetric analysis are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. 

In addition, realization or recognition of PUDs will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for PUDs could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Proved Reserves Disclosures.

We operate in a litigious environment. 

Some of the jurisdictions within which we operate have proven to be litigious environments. Oil and gas companies can be involved in various legal proceedings and disputes with landowners, royalty owners, or other operators over matters such as leases, title transfer, joint interest billing arrangements, revenue distribution, or production or cost sharing arrangements, in the ordinary course of business. For example, in certain states, oil and gas companies are often the target of “legacy lawsuits,” by which a landowner claims that oil and gas operations, often performed many years ago and by another operator, caused pollution or contamination of a property. Various properties we have owned over the past decades potentially expose us to “legacy lawsuit” claims. Similarly, neighboring landowners may allege that current operations cause contamination or create a nuisance.

Because we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that includes both US and international projects, the complexity and types of legal procedures with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. For example, we historically have had to address certain fiscal, antitrust and other regulatory challenges in Israel, including a current lawsuit filed by petitioners alleging we and our partners in Tamar violated antitrust laws through the monopolistic pricing of natural gas to the citizens of Israel. Legal proceedings such as this could result in substantial liability and/or negative publicity about us and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. These proceedings are subject to the uncertainties inherent in any litigation. We will defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters. However, if we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even a halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. 

One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Noble Midstream Partners, which may involve a potential legal liability.

One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of Noble Midstream Partners, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of Noble Midstream Partners may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to Noble Midstream Partners. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisition and divestiture activities. 

As part of our business strategy, we have made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of oil and gas properties and/or entities that own them. If we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. Moreover, even if we do make acquisitions, they may not result in an increase in our cash flows from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:

•incorrect estimates or assumptions about reserves, exploration potential or potential drilling locations;

•incorrect assumptions regarding future revenues, including future commodity prices and differentials, or regarding future development and operating costs;

•incorrect assumptions regarding potential synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;

•difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and

•unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.

Mergers of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger. US antitrust laws require waiting periods and even after completion of a merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge a merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. We have merged with or acquired other companies in the past. Prevention of a merger by antitrust laws could impair our ability to do business. Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions expose us to potential lawsuits or other obligations not yet anticipated at time of merger or acquisition. Such liabilities and obligations could hinder our ability to fully benefit from the acquired business or assets and negatively impact our financial performance. 

The acquisition of a property or business requires management to make complex judgments and assessments, and the accuracy of the assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties 

38
Index to Financial Statements

that we believe to be consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.

We also maintain an ongoing portfolio management program to ensure our company is well-positioned with assets that offer growth at financially attractive investment options. Therefore, we may periodically divest certain material assets. We strive to obtain the most attractive prices for our assets; however, various factors can materially affect our ability to dispose of assets on terms acceptable to us. Such factors may include:

•current commodity prices;

•laws and regulations impacting oil and gas operations in the areas where the assets are located;

•willingness of the purchaser to assume certain liabilities such as asset retirement obligations;

•our willingness to indemnify buyers for certain matters; and

•delays in closing. 

Inability to achieve a desired price for the assets, or underestimation of amounts of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations, can result in a reduction of cash proceeds, a loss on sale due to an excess of the asset's net book value over proceeds, or liabilities which must be settled in the future at amounts that are higher than we anticipated. In addition, although we may successfully divest oil and gas assets, we may retain certain related contracts. For example, although we sold our Marcellus Shale upstream properties in 2017, we retained significant obligations under firm transportation contracts. Our inability to fully commercialize these contracts and reduce the associated financial commitments could result in a decrease in cash flows from operations. In addition, we may be required to recognize losses in accordance with exit or disposal activities. See Item 7. Management's Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Contractual Obligations.

We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions and cash investments.

We are exposed to risk of financial loss from joint venture and other receivables. We are the operator on a majority of our joint venture development projects, including Leviathan. As joint venture operator, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. These projects are capital intensive and, in some cases, a nonoperating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs or have liquidity problems resulting in slow payment of joint venture costs that can result in potential delays in our development projects. In addition, some of our joint venture partners are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience credit rating downgrades or liquidity problems that may hinder their ability to obtain financing. Counterparty liquidity problems could result in a delay in receiving proceeds from reimbursement of joint venture costs. Nonperformance by a joint venture partner could result in significant financial losses.

We have cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions, a majority of which is invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to counterparty credit risk or, in some cases, cause us to incur significant cash settlements. As an entity entering into derivatives transactions under master agreements that are subject to US laws, we are subject to some limitations on our ability to exercise default rights with respect to derivatives transactions with a financially-troubled bank. On January 1, 2019, the US Bank Regulators imposed additional restrictions on counterparties that are parties to certain types of Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs) with major banks that have been designated as Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). These QFCs include various master agreements and the financial derivatives transactions that are entered into under such master agreements with G-SIBs as counterparties. 

While we monitor the creditworthiness of joint venture partners, purchasers, banks and financial institutions with which we conduct business, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of these counterparties and may be exposed to associated risks. Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. In addition, we maintain credit insurance associated with specific purchasers. However, nonperformance by a hedge counterparty or financial institution could result in significant financial losses.

Commodity hedging transactions may limit our potential gains or fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices. 

In order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected revenues. Our hedges, consisting of a series of derivative instrument contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to three years. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if prices rise over the price established by the arrangements. Conversely, our hedging program may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in the price of crude oil or natural gas. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

The insurance we carry is insufficient to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure. 

39
Index to Financial Statements

Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, blowouts, well cratering, fire and explosion, loss of well control, pipeline disruptions, mishandling of fluids and chemicals, and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals, any of which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or formations or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from other disruptive events such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, and expropriation or nationalization of assets, or other interruptions, such as cyber security breaches, which can cause loss of or damage to our property. 

Our insurance program and memberships in domestic and international dedicated oil spill and emergency response organizations may not minimize or fully protect us from losses resulting from damages to or the loss of physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills. We do not have insurance protection against all the risks we face, because we choose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available at a level that balances the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, or actual losses may exceed coverage limits. 

We expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by events such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Impacts could include tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in areas in which we operate, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills. We will continue to monitor for any legislative or regulatory changes related to exploration and production and its potential impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection, at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, against disruption to our operations and cash flows. 

If an event, for example, a major offshore incident resulting in significant personal injury and/or environmental and physical damage, occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties – Risk and Insurance Program.
