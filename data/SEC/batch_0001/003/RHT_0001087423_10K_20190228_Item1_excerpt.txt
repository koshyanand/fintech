PART I 

ITEM 1.BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Red Hat is a leading global provider of open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to develop and offer reliable and high-performing operating system, virtualization, management, middleware, cloud and storage technologies. 

Our business model 

Development. We employ an open source development model. The open source development model allows us to use the collective input, resources and knowledge of a global community of contributors who collaborate to develop, maintain and enhance software. This collaboration is possible because the human-readable source code for that software is publicly available and licenses permit modification. 

Licensing. We typically distribute our software offerings under open source licenses that permit access to the software’s human-readable source code. 

Subscriptions. We provide our software offerings primarily under annual or multi-year subscriptions as well as on-demand through our certified cloud and service providers (“CCSPs”). 

Our offerings 

Our offerings are designed to provide customers with high-performing, scalable, flexible, reliable and secure technologies that meet the information technology (“IT”) needs of enterprises and service providers. Customers can develop and deploy applications using on-premise (physical or virtual environments or private clouds) or off-premise (public cloud) IT resources to create an environment that is designed to enhance efficiency while providing increased security. Our offerings are designed to perform consistently across physical, virtual and hybrid cloud (a combination of one or more public and private clouds) environments to offer our customers greater agility and flexibility for application development and deployment.

OUR BUSINESS 

We use the open source software development and licensing model to provide our offerings to customers primarily on a subscription basis. Subscriptions for our offerings are marketed and sold to customers directly and through business partners. 

Development and licensing of Red Hat’s open source offerings 

The open source software development model allows us to use the collective input, resources and knowledge of a global community of contributors who collaborate to develop, maintain and enhance software. We believe this model offers advantages to Red Hat because we are able to develop our offerings by integrating information, knowledge and testing from this global community. We develop our offerings by working with open source development communities, often in a leadership role. Red Hat sponsors a number of open source projects, including the CentOS project, the Ceph community project, the Fedora Project, GlusterFS, the JBoss community projects and OpenShift Origin. We are also an active contributor in other open source projects such as Apache Camel, Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, the Open Container Initiative, the OpenDaylight Project, Open Platform for NFV and OpenStack. Our participation helps us to benefit from the efforts of these communities, which we believe enhances acceptance and support of our offerings and technologies. Additionally, the open and transparent nature of these communities provides our customers and potential customers, who may also be part of these open source communities, with access and insights into, and the ability to influence, the future direction of our offerings. 

Under the open source licensing model, a software developer distributes the software under an open source license, such as the GNU General Public License (“GPL”), GNU Lesser General Public License or Apache License. Open source licenses provide relatively broad rights for recipients of the software to use, copy, modify and redistribute the software. These rights afford significant latitude for recipients to inspect, suggest changes to, customize or enhance the software. 

The open source model provides an inherent level of transparency and choice that contrasts with the proprietary software model. Under the proprietary software model, a software vendor generally develops the software itself or acquires components from other vendors, without the input from a wider community of participants. The vendor generally licenses to the user only the machine-readable binary (or object) code version of the software, with no or limited rights to copy, modify or redistribute the software, and does not make the underlying source code available to the user or other developers. Moreover, peer review and collaborative enhancements are more difficult because of the lack of access to the source code. 

The scale and efficiency of open source software development has greatly increased through the availability of collaborative technologies and cloud-based tools, such as email lists, websites and code repositories. These technologies have enabled a global community of developers to collaborate on more complex open source projects, many of which are commercially funded. 

We believe that open source software is a viable and arguably superior alternative to traditional proprietary software. Open source software, as compared to proprietary software, offers a number of benefits to customers, including: 

•enabling a customer’s in-house development team to collaborate and innovate with a global community of independent developers and testers; 

•providing a customer’s in-house development team access to both binary and source code, and broader rights to copy, modify and redistribute the software; 

•offering a customer greater flexibility through open rather than proprietary protocols and formats; 

•enabling ongoing, quicker access to improvements and fixes; and 

•allowing a customer to inspect and help diagnose problems more easily and customize the software to suit its particular needs. 

Subscription business model 

We provide our software offerings to our customers primarily under annual or multi-year subscriptions as well as on-demand through CCSPs. Our subscription business model is designed to provide customers with a comprehensive technology solution for the duration of their subscription. A subscription generally entitles a customer to, among other things, a specified level of support, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements, upgrades to the technologies, each if and when available, and compatibility with an ecosystem of certified hardware and software. A subscription also includes access to the Red Hat Customer Portal, which provides customers with services such as our knowledge base, product usage documentation and account management tools. We offer customers subscription options that provide varying levels of customer support. In addition, our customers are eligible to participate in Red Hat’s Open Source Assurance program, which provides certain protections in the event of an intellectual property infringement claim made against a customer and based on our software offerings. 

5
Our subscription business model contrasts with the typical proprietary software license model from a revenue recognition perspective. Under a proprietary software license model, the vendor typically recognizes license revenue in the period that the software is initially licensed. In contrast, under our subscription model, we generally defer revenue when we bill the customer and recognize revenue over the life of the subscription term. 

Distribution of Red Hat offerings 

We make Red Hat offerings available directly to customers and indirectly through various channels of distribution. Our direct sales channels include our sales force and our web store. Our indirect sales channels include CCSPs (such as public cloud providers and managed service providers), distributors, embedded technology partners, independent software vendors (“ISVs”), systems integrators (“SIs”) and value added resellers (“VARs”). In addition, hardware original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) pre-load and support Red Hat offerings on their hardware products and sell their hardware together with Red Hat offerings as part of pre-configured solutions. 

With the support and tools we make available, many of these companies have engineered and certified that their technologies run on or with Red Hat offerings, and, in some cases, independent hardware vendors (“IHVs”) and ISVs have built their products and solutions using our offerings. Our offerings can also be used on an on demand basis through our CCSPs, allowing our customers to utilize their subscriptions with increased flexibility. We believe widespread support from these companies helps to increase the level of market acceptance and adoption of our offerings. 

Support by leading technology providers 

To facilitate the widespread deployment of Red Hat offerings, we have focused on gaining broad support for our offerings from technology providers that are critical to enterprises. For example, leading ISVs with applications that run on, or with, our technologies include Affirmed Networks, Inc., Cerner Corporation, Cloudera, Inc., Dynatrace LLC, Dell Inc. (“Dell”), F5 Networks, Inc. (“F5 Networks”), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”), IBM, Mavenir Systems, Inc., Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), NetApp, Inc. (“NetApp”), Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”), SAP SE (“SAP”), SAS Institute Inc., Swift Technologies Inc., Veritas Technologies LLC and VMware, Inc. (“VMware”). In addition, we have certification and pre-load arrangements with leading hardware vendors including Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), Dell, Fujitsu Limited (“Fujitsu”), HPE, Hitachi, Ltd., IBM, Lenovo Group Ltd. (“Lenovo”) and NEC Corporation. We also have certification agreements with leading networking, storage and telecommunication companies including Big Switch Networks, Inc., Cisco, Dell, Ericsson Inc., F5 Networks, HPE, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Juniper Networks, Inc. and Nokia Corporation. We have strategic relationships with leading semiconductor and technology companies, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., ARM Holdings plc, Intel Corporation, IBM and NVIDIA Corporation. We have strategic relationships with leading cloud computing platforms, such as Alibaba Cloud Computing, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”), Fujitsu, Google Inc. (“Google”), IBM and Microsoft. We also have relationships with a number of global SIs such as Accenture plc, Atos SE, DXC Technology Company, Infosys Limited, IBM, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Tech Mahindra Limited and Wipro Limited.

Subscription revenue by product group 

Subscription revenue for our Infrastructure-related offerings (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat Virtualization and related offerings) as a percentage of our total revenue were 63.4%, 66.8% and 70.3% for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Subscription revenue for our Application Development-related offerings (Red Hat Middleware) and other emerging technology offerings (Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Ansible Automation, Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Storage technologies) as a percentage of our total revenue were 24.3%, 21.4% and 18.2% for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. For additional financial information about our products and services, see NOTE 22—Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Customers

We sell our offerings to enterprises in a variety of industries, including financial services, government, healthcare, retail, technology and media, telecommunications and transportation. For fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the U.S. government and its agencies represented in the aggregate approximately 10% of our total revenue.

Backlog 

We define total backlog as (i) total deferred revenue, which has been billed, plus (ii) the value of non-cancellable subscription agreements not yet billed or reflected in our financial statements and the value of service agreements not yet billed or reflected in our financial statements that we believe to be firm (“off-balance sheet backlog”). Total backlog at February 28, 2019 included deferred revenue classified as a current liability of $2.16 billion and long-term deferred revenue of $821.2 million. The value of off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $1.0 billion, and the portion of such value at February 28, 2019 that we expect to be billed during the fiscal year ending February 29, 2020 is in excess of $490 million. At February 28, 2018, total backlog included deferred revenue classified as a current liability of $1.85 billion and long-term deferred revenue of $741.5 million and the value of off-balance sheet backlog at February 28, 2018 was in excess of $775 million. 

We report our off-balance sheet backlog as a conservative approximation, often describing the amount as “in excess of,” primarily because the value of underlying contracts is derived from data not yet subjected to the complete application of our revenue recognition policies. For example, the value of the service agreements included as a part of off-balance sheet backlog is less than the stated value of such agreements because in certain instances customers are not contractually required to purchase the stated value of such services (e.g., when the services are to be billed on a time and materials basis and the service agreement’s stated value is merely an estimate of the aggregate value of the services to be provided). Historically, the impact on off-balance sheet backlog resulting from the difference in the amount of services billed and the service agreements’ stated value has not been material. We endeavor to derive the value of our off-balance sheet backlog in a consistent manner year over year and, therefore, believe the amounts are comparable.

Seasonality

Our fourth fiscal quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for billing both new business and renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

With respect to our service offerings, we face competition in the markets for services related to the development, deployment and integration of enterprise technologies. Our competitors in these markets include Mirantis and Pivotal, as well as other technology consulting and training companies.

Due to the nature of open source technology, the open source software model is not characterized by the traditional barriers to entry that are found in the proprietary software model. For example, the financial and legal barriers to creating a new Linux distribution are relatively low because the software components typically included in Linux distributions are publicly available under open source licenses that permit copying, modification and redistribution. Anyone can use, copy, modify and redistribute Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Middleware and our other open source offerings. However, they are not permitted to refer to these products as “Red Hat” or “Red Hat JBoss” products unless they have a formal business relationship with us that allows for such references. In addition, the primary means by which customers can receive Red Hat software, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technologies, each if and when available, is to purchase and maintain a current subscription directly from us or our partners with whom we have agreements. Our customers agree that during their support relationship with Red Hat, they will purchase a support subscription for each unit of Red Hat software they deploy. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT

We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in research and development. We expended $668.5 million, $578.3 million and $480.7 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, in research and development costs. We focus and modify our research and development efforts based on our business strategy, the needs of our customers and changes in the marketplace. Our development efforts focus on adding new or improved functionality desired by customers to our portfolio of offerings and supporting the expansion of our third-party hardware and software ecosystems. However, any upgrades and enhancements are offered on an if-and-when-available basis. Red Hat is also investing in developing new software offerings and enabling new forms of development that are aimed at customers who seek hybrid, private and public cloud computing solutions. 

We recognize the importance of open source software development to the enterprise and seek to have a leadership role in the open source ecosystem by supporting our community engagements. Our software engineers collaborate with open source software development teams working through open source projects, such as Apache Camel, the CentOS project, the Ceph community project, the Fedora Project, GlusterFS, the JBoss community projects, Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, the Open Container Initiative, the OpenDaylight Project, Open Platform for NFV, OpenShift Origin and OpenStack. This involvement enables us to remain abreast of, and in some instances lead, certain technical advances, plans for development of new features and timing of releases, as well as other information related to the management of open source projects. 

Our software engineers make development contributions to many components comprising Red Hat software offerings and provide leadership within the various open source communities across many of our core components. Our software engineers also perform extensive testing of Red Hat technologies. We use various industry recognized methods of quality assurance testing to seek to ensure that our technologies are ready for use by our customers when delivered. We also work closely with leading hardware and software vendors to seek to ensure that their hardware and applications will operate effectively with Red Hat platforms. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Our offerings, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Middleware, are built primarily from software components licensed under various open source licenses. While some components are developed by our employees, Red Hat obtains many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source software development projects. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute the software. Certain open source licenses, such as the GPL, impose significant limits on a distributor’s ability to license derivative works under more restrictive terms and generally require the distributor to disclose the source code of such works. The inclusion of software components governed by such licenses in our offerings limits our ability to use traditional proprietary software licensing models for those offerings. As a result, while we have substantial copyright interests in our software technologies, open source development and licensing practices may have the effect of limiting the value of our software copyright assets. Consequently, our trademarks may represent our most valuable intellectual property. 

We pursue registration of some of our trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. We have registered the “Red Hat” and “JBoss” trademarks and the Red Hat Shadowman logo in countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa as well as in Australia. 

13
Despite our efforts to protect our trademark rights, unauthorized third parties have, in the past, attempted and, in the future, may attempt, to misappropriate our trademark rights. We cannot be certain that we will succeed in preventing such misappropriation of our trade names and trademarks. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect or deter misappropriation of our trademark rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In addition, while we engage in certain enforcement activity, policing unauthorized use of our trademark rights is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and our efforts may be inadequate. The loss of any material trademark or trade name could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Red Hat also seeks patent protection for some of the innovative ideas of our software developers and other employees. Some of these inventions are applicable to our current technologies, while others provide protection to new and other technologies. Moreover, our principal objectives in seeking patent protection are to provide a measure of deterrence against the potential patent infringement claims of third parties and to a more limited extent to help ensure that new technologies and innovations covered by our patents remain open. As part of Red Hat’s commitment to the open source community, we provide our Patent Promise, an undertaking, subject to certain limitations, not to enforce our patent rights against users of open source software covered by certain open source licenses. This permits the development and distribution of open source applications by third parties that could otherwise infringe on our patents. For these reasons, it is unlikely that our patents will, of themselves, provide us substantial revenue. 

Third parties have, in the past, asserted and, in the future, may assert, infringement claims against us, which may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to third-party intellectual property rights. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Red Hat regularly commits to its subscription customers that if portions of our offerings are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights we will, at our expense and option: obtain the right for the customer to continue to use the technology consistent with their subscription agreement with us; modify the technology so that its use is non-infringing; or replace the infringing component with a non-infringing component, and defend them against specified infringement claims. Although we cannot predict whether we will need to satisfy these commitments and we often have limitations on these commitments, satisfying these commitments could be costly, be time-consuming, divert the attention of technical and management personnel, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 

We also generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our confidential documentation and other proprietary information.
