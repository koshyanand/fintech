ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of February 2, 2019.

Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of February 2, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

As of February 2, 2019, we have one outstanding series of unsecured 6.53% Series B Senior Notes due December 2021 with an aggregate principal amount of $65 million. We also have unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. Interest that is payable on our Senior Notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates. 

Interest is receivable on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments as of and for the year ended February 2, 2019. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near-term changes in interest rates to be material.
