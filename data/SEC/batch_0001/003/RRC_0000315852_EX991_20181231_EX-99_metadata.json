This is to identify proved developed producing reserves as those to be recovered from actively producing wells. Proved developed nonproducing reserves are those to be recovered from wells or intervals within wells, which are completed but shut-in waiting on equipment or pipeline connections, or wells where a relatively minor expenditure is required for recompletion to another zone."
