OVERVIEW

Management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating Schwab’s financial position and operating performance. We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets, is a measure of operating efficiency. Results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) 2018 includes outflows of $93.9 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2017 includes inflows of $34.5 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 

2018 Compared to 2017 

Net income increased by $1.2 billion, or 49%, in 2018, driven primarily by business momentum, a supportive economic environment for much of the year, and lower corporate tax rates. Continued execution of our ‘Through Clients’ Eyes’ strategy helped us succeed with clients. In 2018, clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts, helping bring active brokerage accounts to 11.6 million at the end of the year, and core net new assets totaled $227.8 billion, up 15% from the 2017 total. Our strong net new assets largely offset lower market valuations, and we ended 2018 at $3.25 trillion in total client assets.

Total net revenue grew by $1.5 billion, or 18%, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $1.5 billion, or 36%, in net interest revenue. The Fed raised the overnight federal funds target interest rate four times in 2018 for a total of 100 basis points. The growth of total net revenue resulted from higher interest rates due to the Fed’s rate normalization, and also from higher

interest-earning assets, which reflect both client cash allocations and the transfer of sweep money market funds to bank and broker-dealer sweep. As we progressed with these transfers, the corresponding money market fund asset management and administration fee revenue naturally declined, yet positive inflows in advice solutions, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs kept asset management fees at $3.2 billion, limiting the decrease to 5% from 2017. Record trading activity from our clients resulted in trading revenue reaching $763 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year.

Our increase in total expenses excluding interest of $602 million, or 12%, reflected our 2018 investments to support and fuel our business growth, including hiring additional client-facing and other employees and technology project spending, as well as an increase in marketing and a special stock award of $36 million to our employees. Even with these increases, expenses as a percentage of client assets remained consistent at 16 basis points, and pre-tax income increased 25% to $4.6 billion in 2018, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 45.0%. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), taxes on income decreased 19% in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. Overall, we generated a 19% return on equity and diluted EPS of $2.45 for the year.

During 2018, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 63% to $0.13 per share and authorized a $1.0 billion Share Repurchase Program, which we completed during the fourth quarter. These actions reflected the Company’s strong financial performance and our confidence in its long-term success; they also demonstrated that effective capital management at Schwab can support both healthy business growth and more meaningful capital returns to stockholders. 

2017 Compared to 2016 

Net income available to common stockholders rose in 2017 by $434 million, or 25%, from the prior year, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.61 in 2017 – an increase of 23% compared to $1.31 in 2016. Net revenues improved by $1.1 billion, or 15%, while expenses excluding interest increased $483 million, or 11%, compared to 2016.

Our steady focus on operating ‘through clients’ eyes’ and our goal to continually challenge the status quo helped Schwab achieve another strong growth year in 2017. Clients opened 1.4 million new brokerage accounts in 2017 and trusted Schwab with $198.6 billion of core net new assets in 2017, up 58% from 2016. Total assets receiving ongoing advisory services grew 21% in 2017 to $1.70 trillion. Our success with clients was bolstered by strength in the equity markets – the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index (S&P 500) finished 2017 up 19% from the prior year end. Also in 2017, the Federal Reserve increased the overnight federal funds target interest rate three times for a total of 75 basis points. Strong client activity and the positive economic environment resulted in total client assets rising to $3.36 trillion as of December 31, 2017 – a 21% increase since the end of 2016.

Schwab’s 2017 financial results demonstrate the power of our financial formula working as designed: our robust business growth supported strong revenue growth through multiple sources in 2017, which we combined with continued expense discipline to drive significantly improved profitability.

Net revenues grew by 15% in 2017 compared to 2016 through contributions from our two largest revenue sources. Net interest revenue rose 29% while asset management and administration fees grew 11% in 2017 when compared to the prior year. Trading revenue declined in 2017 by 21% due to price reductions announced early in 2017. 

Consistent with our expectations, expenses grew 11% in 2017 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and higher staffing related to our strong asset gathering, as well as expenses related to project spending and third-party fees tied to higher balances in our asset management business. 

This combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove the pre-tax profit margin to 42.4% – an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year. Earnings before income taxes rose 22% to $3.7 billion in 2017 compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year. 

The effective tax rate in 2017 was 35.5% compared to 36.9% in 2016 reflecting the benefit from the adoption of new accounting standards requiring the recognition of a portion of tax deductions related to equity compensation partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments associated with the 2017 enactment of the Tax Act.

Subsequent Event

On January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $4.0 billion of common stock, and declared a four cent, or 31%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per common share. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date.  

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments

On October 31, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued another notice of proposed rulemaking. The two proposals would establish a revised framework for applying enhanced prudential standards to large U.S. banking organizations, with four categories of standards that reflect the risks of banking organizations in each group. CSC would be in Category III based on having $250 billion – $700 billion in total assets.

The Federal Reserve proposal, which would make large savings and loan holding companies such as CSC subject to enhanced prudential standards, would tailor those regulatory requirements relating to capital stress testing, risk management, liquidity risk management, and single-counterparty credit limits based on the category of the banking organization. The proposal provides that Category III banking organizations would be subject to annual supervisory stress testing and biennial company-run stress testing. The interagency proposal would similarly tailor requirements under the agencies’ capital rule, LCR rule, and the proposed net stable funding ratio rule for banking organizations in each category. Under the proposal, banking organizations in Category III would not be required to calculate their risk-weighted assets using the “advanced approaches” framework or to include AOCI in calculating their regulatory capital; however, they would continue to be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and any future countercyclical capital buffer imposed by the banking agencies.

Although the Federal Reserve announced in its proposal that additional capital planning and resolution planning proposals would be issued at a later date, the agency did indicate that all Category III firms, including savings and loan holding companies, would be required to submit annual capital plans that would be subject to qualitative and quantitative assessments evaluated as part of the CCAR process.

The comment period for both proposed rules ended on January 22, 2019 and the impact to Schwab cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.

On December 22, 2017, P.L.115-97, the Tax Act, was signed into law, and became effective on January 1, 2018. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 

As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) require companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the date of enactment, with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. Schwab recorded a one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our 2018 effective income tax rate was reduced as a result of these changes. 

In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum NSFR on certain banking organizations, including CSC. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2016 and the impact to the Company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Total Net Revenues

Total net revenues of $10.1 billion and $8.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represented growth of 18% and 15% from the prior periods, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Interest Revenue

Schwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-related securities and loans. Fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by CS&Co using assets held in client brokerage accounts, are included in other interest revenue and expense.

Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. We establish the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. During 2018, these liabilities rose by a total of $63.3 billion, largely reflecting the effect of: our transferring a total of $72 billion sweep money market funds to bank and broker-dealer sweep; clients choosing to reallocate assets between cash, equities, fixed income and other investments; and the Company gathering additional flows from new and current clients. 

Overall, management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis until recently has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity. With the Federal Funds Target Rate having increased to 2.25 – 2.50%, management expects some sweep cash balances could migrate to alternatives, including purchased money market funds, that offer higher yields to clients but lower revenue to Schwab. 

Given the general stability and relatively low rate sensitivity of client-related liabilities, management believes their duration is at least several years. We have positioned Schwab to benefit from an increase in interest rates, especially short-term interest rates, by managing the duration of interest-earning assets to be shorter than that of interest-bearing liabilities, so that asset yields are expected to move faster than liability costs.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which, along with the transfers of existing sweep cash balances from money market funds, is a primary driver of balance sheet growth. By managing the duration of interest-earning assets as necessary, we are positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level. Approximately half of our interest earning assets re-price or reset based on short-term interest rates such as one-month LIBOR. 

Non-interest-bearing funding sources include certain cash balances, stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities.

The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.

Net interest revenue increased $1.5 billion or 36%, in 2018 from 2017, and $960 million, or 29%, in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to higher interest rates and growth in interest-earning assets. 

Our net interest margin improved 32 basis points to 2.29% in 2018, primarily as a result of the Federal Reserve’s 2017 and 2018 interest rate increases, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 1.97% in 2017, representing an improvement of 24 basis points compared to 2016, primarily due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2016 and 2017. 

Average interest earning assets grew 16% and 14% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared with the sequential prior years. These increases primarily reflect higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep balances, as well as changes in client cash allocations, partially offset by client purchases of other assets. 

In March 2017, $24.7 billion of debt securities were transferred from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin. For additional information on the transfer, see Item 8 – Note 6.

Asset Management and Administration Fees

Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund and ETF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund and ETF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and ETFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.

We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, collective trust fund fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.

Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. 

The following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes Schwab ETF OneSource™.

(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, a change was made to add non-fee based average assets from managed portfolios. Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above. Prior periods have been adjusted to accommodate this change.

(3) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, a prospective methodology change was made to average client assets relating to 401(k) recordkeeping fees to provide improved insight into the associated fee driver, which resulted in an increase of approximately $25 billion. There was no impact to revenue or the average fee.

(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.

Asset management and administration fees decreased by $163 million, or 5%, in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in advice solutions, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs.

- 30 -

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Asset management and administration fees increased by $337 million, or 11%, in 2017 from 2016 due to higher average client assets invested in advice solutions, mutual funds and ETFs, and lower fee waivers on money market funds. Partially offsetting these increases were lower fee rates on proprietary money funds and other indexed mutual funds and ETFs due to fee reductions implemented by Schwab in 2017.

The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds. The following funds generated 47%, 53%, and 53% of the asset management and administration fees earned during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes net inflows from other third-party mutual funds to Mutual Fund OneSource® in the second quarter of 2017.

Trading Revenue

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, Schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government and corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.

The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Trading revenue increased by $109 million, or 17%, in 2018 compared to 2017. DART volumes increased 31% in 2018, which more than offset Schwab’s commission pricing reductions implemented in the first quarter of 2017. Trading revenue decreased by $171 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to lower commissions rates on DARTs. 

During the first quarter of 2017, we announced two trading price reductions which lowered standard equity, ETF, and option trade commissions from $8.95 to $4.95 and lowered the per contract option fee from $.75 to $.65. These reductions in commission rates reflect our continuing belief that pricing should never be an obstacle for choosing Schwab and our commitment to share the benefits of scale with clients. 

With these changes, trading revenue has declined from a peak of 50%-60% of total revenue in the early 1990’s to the current low of 8% in 2018, 8% in 2017, and 11% in 2016.

Other Revenue

Other revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from our portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and non-recurring gains. Order flow revenue was $139 million during 2018, $114 million for 2017, and $103 million in 2016. These increases were primarily due to higher rebate rates received on certain types of

orders and higher volume of trades. In 2016, other revenue also included net litigation proceeds of $16 million related to our non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolios.

Expenses excluding interest increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years by 12% and 11%, respectively. The largest drivers of the increase in both years were compensation and benefits and professional services. 

Total compensation and benefits increased in 2018 and 2017 from prior years, primarily due to increases in employee headcount to support our expanding client base. Additionally, in 2018 non-officer employees were issued special stock awards totaling $36 million.

Professional services expense increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, primarily due to higher spending on technology projects as well as an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the Schwab Funds® and Schwab ETFs™. 

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.

Advertising and market development expense rose in 2018, primarily reflecting management’s decision to increase television advertising and digital media spending in the fourth quarter. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with our investments in software and technology enhancements.

Regulatory fees assessments increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, due to an increase in FDIC insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher average assets in deposit balances. This increase in 2018 was partially offset by the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Other expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 due to travel and entertainment and miscellaneous items due to overall growth in our business. Other expenses increased in 2017 from 2016 due to travel and entertainment, asset volume-related increases, and some miscellaneous items.

Capital expenditures were $576 million, $412 million, and $353 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in both 2018 and 2017 from the prior years was primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S. and investments in technology projects. The largest component of capital expenditures in 2018 was investment in buildings of $253 million. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software totaled $167 million, $157 million, and $130 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our capital expenditures for 2018 came in at the lower end of our estimated range of 6-7% of total net revenues, largely due to the timing of our campus expansion work. As we carry this work forward in 2019 and invest further in technology projects, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will reach approximately 7-9% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.

Taxes on Income

As previously discussed under Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments, the Tax Act was signed into law during 2017. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018. 

Also as a result of the Tax Act, Schwab recognized a $46 million one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the Tax Act. 

Effective January 1, 2017, Schwab adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which prospectively changed the accounting treatment of a portion of the tax deductions relating to equity compensation. These deductions were previously reflected directly in additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity, and are now included in taxes on income, a component of net income. As a result of this change, our tax expense was reduced by approximately $46 million and $87 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future effects will depend on our share price, restricted stock vesting, and the volume of equity incentive options exercised.

Schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.1% in 2018, 35.5% in 2017, and 36.9% in 2016. The decrease in rates over this three-year time period was primarily due to the net impact of the above items. 

Segment Information

Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services, retirement plan services, and other corporate brokerage services to individual investors. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services as well as retirement business services to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the advisor platform.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investor Services

Total net revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 18%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Expenses excluding interest increased by $420 million, or 11%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, and asset management and administration related expenses to support our expanding client base. 

Total net revenues increased by $789 million, or 15%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher client assets enrolled in advisory solutions and higher net fees on money market fund assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower commission rates. Expenses excluding interest increased by $345 million, or 10%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, asset management and administration related expenses, and regulatory fee assessments.

Advisor Services

Total net revenues increased by $393 million or 16%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Expenses excluding interest increased by $182 million, or 15%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, and asset management and administration related expenses to support our expanding client base.

Total net revenues increased by $351 million, or 17%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher net interest margins. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher fees from growth in client assets invested in ETFs and equity and bond funds, and higher net fees on money market fund assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower commission rates. Expenses excluding interest increased by $138 million, or 12%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, asset management and administration related expenses, and regulatory fee assessments.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Schwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.

Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.

Culture

The Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.

We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.

Risk Governance

Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. 

The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.

We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.

The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.

Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:

•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure, and includes a subcommittee covering Fiduciary Risk;

•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves capital, credit, liquidity, and market risk policies, limits, and exposures;

•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and

•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Fraud, Data, Information Security, Model Governance, and Third-Party risk.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.

In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

Operational Risk

Operational risks arise due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.

Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.

Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s fraud and cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.

Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk 

- 36 -

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.

Compliance Risk

Schwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. 

We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. 

Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform on its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. 

Liquidity and Investment Portfolios

Schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.

At December 31, 2018, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.

Mortgage Lending Portfolio

The bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.

Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). 

- 37 -

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 7. 

Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios

Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.

Other Counterparty Exposures

Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to Schwab.

Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. 

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.

To mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of our interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios.

Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.

Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. 

Net Interest Revenue Simulation

For Schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due 

- 38 -

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.

If our guidelines for net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. There were no breaches of Schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity risk limits during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.

As represented by the simulations presented below, our investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall.

The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheets would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheets and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2018 and 2017 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The year-over-year change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects higher interest rates across the yield curve, and particularly, higher short-term interest rates.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.

Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of CS&Co, the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries, principal and interest due on corporate debt, dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock, and returns of capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of CS&Co are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.

We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.

The Company was subject to, and was in compliance with, the modified LCR rule at December 31, 2018. As Schwab’s consolidated balance sheet assets were above $250 billion at December 31, 2018, Schwab will become subject to the full LCR rule in the second quarter of 2019. The table below presents information about our average LCR: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) This amount represents modified net cash outflows as defined by the LCR rule, which requires that HQLA cover 70% of total stressed net cash outflows.

Primary Funding Sources

Schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. 

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.

To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, a buffer of highly liquid investments, currently comprised of U.S. Treasury notes, is also maintained.

Additional Funding Sources

In addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from these facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.

The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Amounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. 

(2) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes to not exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility.

(3) Other than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2018.

(4) Amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. 

Certain banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. During 2018, CSB used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities in advance of bank sweep transfers. This credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. 

- 40 -

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

CSB also has access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. 

CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2018 or 2017.

The financial covenants for the $750 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, CSB to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2018, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $14.5 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2018 was $20.9 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.

To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $225 million at December 31, 2018. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2018 or 2017. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.

CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.

Borrowings

Long-term debt outstanding was $6.9 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No short-term borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Short-term borrowings outstanding from the FHLB were $15.0 billion at December 31, 2017. 

The following are details of the Senior Notes:

Equity Issuances and Redemptions

CSC did not issue any equity through external offerings during the year ended December 31, 2018. CSC’s preferred stock issued and net proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2017 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On December 1, 2017, CSC redeemed all of the 485,000 outstanding shares of its 6.00% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (“Series B Preferred Stock”), and the corresponding 19,400,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock.

For further discussion of CSC’s long-term debt and information on the equity offerings, see Item 8 – Note 13 and Note 17.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Schwab enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Note 7, Note 11, Note 13, Note 14, and Note 15. 

Contractual Obligations

Schwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and short-term borrowings) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to the subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.

Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.

For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

CSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.

Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2018, CSB is considered well capitalized.

The following table details CSC’s consolidated and CSB’s capital ratios:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) CSC and CSB elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in CET1 Capital. Beginning in 2019, CSC is required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital. 

CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC.

As a broker-dealer, CS&Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit CS&Co from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to the parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2018, CS&Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements.

In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 21 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.

Dividends

Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 119 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 23 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.

Share Repurchases

On October 25, 2018, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors terminated the existing two share repurchase authorizations and replaced them with a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of common stock. CSC repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock for $1.0 billion in 2018, completing all repurchases under this authorization. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2018 prior to the fourth quarter, or in 2017. 

On January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date.

FOREIGN HOLDINGS

At December 31, 2018, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of these holdings totaled $7.6 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $2.8 billion, Sweden at $1.3 billion, and Canada at $0.8 billion. 

In addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies, Schwab has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in CSIM money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from brokerage clearing activities. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $21 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries. Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $746 million at December 31, 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Note 2 and Note 16 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.

When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles.

While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.

Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Income Taxes

Schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. 

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be

significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 20 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.

Legal and Regulatory Reserves

Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 14 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.
