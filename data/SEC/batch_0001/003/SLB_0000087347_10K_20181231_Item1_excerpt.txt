SPM creates alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator whereby Schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation. These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customer assets under long-term agreements. Schlumberger will invest its own services and products, and in some cases cash, into the field development activities and operations. Although in certain arrangements Schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides, generally Schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products. Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a fee-per-barrel basis. This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline. SPM represented less than 5% of Schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings. The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services and products. Manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers are shared, and the labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition, which vary geographically with respect to the different services and products offered. While Schlumberger has numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes it is an industry leader in providing geophysical equipment and services, wireline logging, well production testing, exploration and production software, rig equipment, surface equipment, subsea equipment, artificial lift, hydraulic fracturing, cementing, coiled-tubing services, drilling and completion fluids, solids control and waste management, drilling pressure control, drill bits, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, directional-drilling services, and surface data (mud) logging. 

GENERAL  

Intellectual Property  

Schlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger’s business. While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to Schlumberger’s business.  

Seasonality  

Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets.  

Customers and Backlog of Orders  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Other than the OneSubsea, Drilling Systems and WesternGeco businesses, Schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses. The combined backlog of these businesses was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2018 (of which approximately 50% is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019) and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2017.
