Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Below are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.

•Net earnings decreased 14.0% to $1,935 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by increases in provision for loan losses and other expense, as well as the impact related to the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, partially offset by higher net interest income. Adjusted net earnings, excluding the additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, was $2,095 million. 

•Loan receivables increased 7.3% to $81,947 million at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth. 

•Net interest income increased 11.0% to $15,016 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher average loan receivables. 

•Retailer share arrangements increased 1.2% to $2,937 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of growth and margin improvement of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, largely offset by higher provision for loan losses associated with these programs.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Other expense increased by $331 million, or 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by business growth and marketing.

•The enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017 resulted in additional tax expense of $160 million primarily due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset and impacted certain financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

30

•We continue to invest in our direct banking activities to grow our deposit base. Total deposits increased 8.5% to $56.5 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016, primarily driven by growth in our direct deposits of 12.7% to $42.7 billion, partially offset by a reduction in our brokered deposits.

•On May 18, 2017, the Board announced plans to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share commencing in the third quarter of 2017 and approval of a share repurchase program of up to $1.64 billion through June 30, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased $1,496 million of our outstanding common stock, and also declared and paid cash dividends of $0.56 per share, or $446 million.

•During the year ended December 31, 2017, we announced our acquisition of GPShopper, a developer of mobile applications that offers retailers and brands a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytical tools.

Business Trends and Conditions 

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:

•Growth in loan receivables and interest income. We believe continuing stability in the U.S. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. In addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. We anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. In the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. Our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. On January 23, 2019, we announced our agreement to sell the outstanding loan receivables related to our Walmart program agreement. The sale of the portfolio, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2019. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we will present these loan receivables as loan receivables held for sale on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The reclassification of these loan receivables will result in a reduction in the growth of our loan receivables, as compared to the prior year. In addition, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term other than those associated with changes in the prime rate and LIBOR, and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on interest-earning assets will remain relatively stable.

•Increases in retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements. We believe that the payments we make to our partners under our retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, are likely to increase in absolute terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of both the overall growth and performance of our programs. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Retailer Share Arrangements for additional information on these agreements. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements. Our Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years, and the average length of our relationship with our Retail Card partners is 20 years. We expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis. 

A total of 22 of our 28 ongoing Retail Card program agreements, which does not include the Walmart program, now have an expiration date in 2022 or beyond. These 22 program agreements represented in the aggregate 97% of both our Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2018 and of our Retail Card loan receivables at December 31, 2018 attributable to our ongoing programs.

35

•Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners’ locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase in excess of the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we typically do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. Overall, we expect our loyalty program costs to continue to be largely offset by our interchange revenues. These changes have been contemplated in our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Seasonality

In our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down. 

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

36

Interest Income

Interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.

We analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. Key drivers of average interest-earning assets include:

•purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners’ sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;

•payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;

•charge-offs, reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible;

•the size of our liquidity portfolio; and

•portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.

Key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:

•pricing (contractual rates of interest, movement in prime rates, late fees and merchant discount rates);

•changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);

•frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date;

•credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and

•yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.

Interest income increased by $1,581 million, or 9.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, and by $1,629 million, or 11.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were driven primarily by growth in our average loan receivables.

Average interest-earning assets 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in average loan receivables of 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the PayPal Credit Acquisition, higher purchase volume and average active account growth. Purchase volume and average active accounts increased 6.7% and 5.5%, respectively, including the effects of the PayPal Credit acquisition.

37

The increase in average loan receivables of 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 5.1% and average active accounts growth of 4.5%.

Yield on average interest-earning assets 

The yield on average interest-earning assets decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the yield on our average loan receivables of 24 basis points to 21.18% for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interest-earning assets attributable to loan receivables and a slight increase in the yield on our average loan receivables of 3 basis points to 21.42% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and senior unsecured notes.

Key drivers of interest expense include:

•the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

•the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and

•the changing mix in our funding sources.

Interest expense increased by $479 million, or 34.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher benchmark interest rates. Our cost of funds increased to 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 1.90% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Interest expense increased by $143 million, or 11.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the growth in our deposit liabilities. Our cost of funds increased to 1.90% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.85% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates.

Average interest-bearing liabilities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increases in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily driven by growth in our direct deposits.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense.

Net interest income increased by $1,102 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, and by $1,486 million, or 11.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables.

38

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. We also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the growth and margin improvement of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years.

We believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours. We also believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.

Retailer share arrangements increased by $162 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by the growth of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, including the PayPal Credit acquisition, partially offset by the impact from the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy. 

Retailer share arrangements increased by $35 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven primarily by the growth and margin improvement of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, largely offset by higher provision for loan losses associated with these programs. 

Provision for Loan Losses

Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss (i.e., aged, fraud, deceased, settlement, other non-aged and bankruptcy). See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Loan Losses” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology. 

Provision for loan losses increased by $249 million, or 4.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the reserve build for the PayPal Credit program, as well as higher net charge-offs. These increases were partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve build for our existing portfolio. Our allowance coverage ratio increased to 6.90% at December 31, 2018, as compared to 6.80% at December 31, 2017, reflecting the increase in forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio.

39

Provision for loan losses increased by $1,310 million, or 32.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher net charge-offs and a higher loan loss reserve. Our allowance coverage ratio increased to 6.80% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 5.69% at December 31, 2016, reflecting the increase in forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio.

Other Income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interchange revenue 

We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount. Growth in interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products.

Interchange revenue increased by $57 million, or 8.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, and by $51 million, or 8.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by increases in purchase volume outside of our retail partners' sales channels.

Debt cancellation fees 

Debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. 

Debt cancellation fees decreased by $5 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of lower average balances on accounts with payment protection products. Debt cancellation fees increased by $10 million, or 3.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of higher average balances and increases in customer enrollment. 

Loyalty programs 

We operate a number of loyalty programs primarily in our Retail Card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. Growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.

Loyalty programs cost increased by $47 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, and by $157 million, or 28.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs. The increase in 2017 also included the impact from higher reward redemption rates we experienced in one of our programs.

Other 

Other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and realized gains or losses associated with investments and sales of assets.

40

Other decreased by $28 million, or 41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the impact of a pre-tax gain of $18 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Other increased by $40 million, or 148.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase included a pre-tax gain of $18 million associated with the sale of contractual relationships related to processing of general purpose card transactions for certain merchants in 2017. 

Other Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Employee costs 

Employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.

Employee costs increased by $123 million, or 9.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, and by $106 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to new employees added to support the continued growth of the business. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by the replacement of certain third-party services. 

Professional fees 

Professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.

Professional fees increased by $177 million, or 28.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to interim servicing costs associated with the PayPal Credit acquisition.

Professional fees decreased by $9 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to decreases in third-party expenses as we continued to move some processes in-house, partially offset by business growth. 

Marketing and business development 

Marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.

Marketing and business development costs increased by $30 million, or 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to strategic investments in our sales platforms and increased marketing on retail deposits.

Marketing and business development costs increased by $75 million, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to strategic investments in our sales platforms, card re-issuances for some of our partner programs and increased marketing on retail deposits.

Information processing 

Information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.

41

Information processing costs increased by $53 million, or 14.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to both business growth and strategic investments. 

Information processing costs increased by $35 million, or 10.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher information technology investment and higher transaction volume.

Other 

Other primarily consists of postage, operational losses, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities' costs and telephone charges. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. Fraud, or operational losses, are driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.

The “other” component decreased by $35 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by lower operational losses.

The “other” component increased by $124 million, or 15.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by higher operational losses and business growth.

Provision for Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018, decreased compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the 2018 U.S. corporate tax rate included in the Tax Act and $160 million of additional tax expense recognized in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the $160 million of additional tax expense described above. In each year, the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the Tax Act in 2017, differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, primarily due to state income taxes. 

42

Platform Analysis

As discussed above under “Our Business—Our Sales Platforms,” we offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the year ended December 31, 2018, for each of our sales platforms.

Retail Card

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Retail Card interest and fees on loans increased by $1,114 million, or 9.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and by $1,125 million, or 10.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were primarily the result of growth in average loan receivables. 

Retailer share arrangements increased by $140 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and by $34 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the factors discussed under the heading “Retailer Share Arrangements” above.

Other income increased by $7 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in interchange revenue, partially offset by an increase in loyalty program costs. Other income decreased by $76 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in loyalty program costs, partially offset by increases in interchange revenue, debt cancellation fees and other income.

CareCredit interest and fees on loans increased by $136 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and by $183 million, or 10.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were primarily driven by increases in average loan receivables.

Loan Receivables

____________________________________________________________________________________________

The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio.

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loan receivables increased by $11,192 million, or 13.7%, at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the PayPal Credit acquisition, higher purchase volume and average active account growth. Loan receivables increased by $5,610 million, or 7.3%, at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth.

44

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following maturity distribution at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]______________________

(1)Credit card loans have minimum payment requirements but no stated maturity and therefore are included in the due within one year category. However, many of our credit card holders will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances at December 31, 2018.

(2)Credit card and commercial loans due after one year relate to Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") assets.

(3)Reflects scheduled repayments up to the final contractual maturity of our installment loans.

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings

Our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions, principal forgiveness, extensions or other actions, which may cause the related loan to be classified as a TDR and also be impaired. We use long-term modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve long-term collectability of the loans that are classified as TDRs. The long-term program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The long-term program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. We also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. The loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. The determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the TDR criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.

Loans classified as TDRs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. Our allowance for loan losses on TDRs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows.

45

Interest income from loans accounted for as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. We accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are charged-off in the period the accounts become 180 days past due. The following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest, loans that are 90 days or more past-due and still accruing interest, and earning TDRs for the periods presented.

(1)Excludes purchase credit impaired (“PCI”) loan receivables. See Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our PCI loan receivables.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Delinquencies

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.76% at December 31, 2018, as compared to 4.67% at December 31, 2017. The 9 basis point increase in 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the PayPal Credit acquisition, partially offset by the impact from certain underwriting refinements. 

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.67% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.32% at December 31, 2016. The 35 basis point increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by moderating credit trends. 

Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The table below sets forth the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses totaled $6,427 million at December 31, 2018 compared with $5,574 million at December 31, 2017, representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 6.90% at December 31, 2018, from 6.80% at December 31, 2017, which reflects the increase in forecasted net charge-offs over the next twelve months. 

The following tables provide changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods presented:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]______________________

(1)Net charge-offs (gross charge-offs less recoveries) in certain portfolios may exceed the beginning allowance for loan losses as our revolving credit portfolios turn over more than once per year or, in all portfolios, can reflect losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of the period due to information becoming available during the period, which may identify further deterioration of existing loan receivables.

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.

Funding Sources

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and third-party debt. 

The following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]______________________[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Deposits

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers (“direct deposits”) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers (“brokered deposits”). At December 31, 2018, we had $49.4 billion in direct deposits and $14.6 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.

Our direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. 

48

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 11 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at December 31, 2018, had a weighted average remaining life of 2.1 years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

The following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing time deposits was 1.2 years.

The following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]______________________

(1)Includes brokered certificates of deposit for which underlying individual deposit balances are assumed to be less than $100,000.

Securitized Financings

We have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (“SYNIT”) through which we issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”). 

49

At December 31, 2018, we had $5.8 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $8.6 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each case held by unrelated third parties.

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]______________________

(1)Excludes subordinated classes of SYNCT notes and SYNIT notes that we own.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT. 

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]______________________

(1)Represents the excess spread (generally calculated as interest income collected from the applicable pool of loan receivables less applicable net charge-offs, interest expense and servicing costs, divided by the aggregate principal amount of loan receivables in the applicable pool) for each trust (or, in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, represents a range of the excess spreads relating to the particular series issued within the trust, omitting any series that have not been outstanding for at least three monthly periods), in each case calculated in accordance with the applicable trust or series documentation, for the three securitization monthly periods ended December 31, 2018.

(2)Includes subordinated classes of SYNCT and SYNIT notes that we own.

Third-Party Debt

Senior Unsecured Notes

The following table provides a summary of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)The amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs. 

At December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of outstanding senior unsecured notes was $9.6 billion and the weighted average interest rate was 3.54%.

Short-Term Borrowings

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.

Other 

At December 31, 2018, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

Covenants

The indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) Synchrony’s ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.

51

If we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2018, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

Currently, Synchrony’s senior unsecured debt is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch and BBB- (stable outlook) by S&P. The Bank’s senior unsecured debt is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch and BBB (stable outlook) by S&P. In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Liquidity

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of our Risk Committee. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at December 31, 2018 had $14.8 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $15.1 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2017. The decrease in liquid assets was primarily due to the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal Credit acquisition, partially offset by the retention of excess cash flows from operations and deposit growth.

As additional sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate of $3.9 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends, see “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.”

Debt Securities

____________________________________________________________________________________________

The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our debt securities portfolio. All of our debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are held to meet our liquidity objectives or to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value. 

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of debt securities at the dates indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale debt securities that are not other-than-temporarily impaired are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of comprehensive income (loss) until realized. At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our debt securities had gross unrealized gains of $1 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, and gross unrealized losses of $48 million, $32 million and $31 million, respectively. 

Our debt securities portfolio had the following maturity distribution at December 31, 2018. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
