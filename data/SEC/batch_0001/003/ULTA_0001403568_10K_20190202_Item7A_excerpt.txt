Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.  

 Interest rate risk  

 We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowing under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of February 2, 2019, February 3, 2018, or January 28, 2017.
