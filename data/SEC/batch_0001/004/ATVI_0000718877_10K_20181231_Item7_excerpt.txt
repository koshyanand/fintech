Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

  Business Overview  

 Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, PC, and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  

  The King Acquisition  

 On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further described in Note 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.  

  Reportable Segments  

 Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.  

(i) Activision  

 Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platforms. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.  

 In 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision. Going forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate the relationship, the Company recognized net bookingsa key operating metricof $20 million, GAAP revenues of $164 million, and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  

(ii) Blizzard  

 Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our MLG business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.

(iii) King  

 King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as Google's Android and Apple's iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King's games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.  

  Other  

 We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:   

 the Studios business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties; and  

 the Distribution business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.   

  Business Results and Highlights  

  Financial Results  

 The Company's 2018 financial results are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2018. Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards. Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 2018 financial highlights included:   

 consolidated net revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion and consolidated operating income increased 52% to $2.0 billion, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $7.0 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2017;  

 revenues from digital online channels increased 6% to $5.8 billion, or 77% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $5.5 billion, or 78% of consolidated net revenues, in 2017;  

 operating margin was 26.5%, as compared to 18.7% in 2017;  

 cash flows from operating activities were approximately $1.79 billion, a decrease of 19%, as compared to $2.21 billion in 2017;   

 consolidated net income increased to $1.8 billion, as compared to $273 million in 2017, which included significant discrete tax-related impacts in both 2017 and 2018refer to Consolidated Results discussion below for details; and  

 diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.35, as compared to $0.36 in 2017.   

 Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018, include net effects of $238 million and $100 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.

  Content Release and Event Highlights  

 Games and downloadable content that were released during 2018, include:   

 Activision's four downloadable content packs for Call of Duty: WWII;   

 Activision's Warmind and Forsaken, the second and third expansions to Destiny 2;  

 Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 4;  

 Activision's Spyro Reignited Trilogy, a remastered version of the first three Spyro the Dragon games;  

 Blizzard's latest expansions to HearthstoneThe Witchwood ,  The Boomsday Project, and Rastakhan's Rumble;   

 Blizzard's World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, the seventh expansion to World of Warcraft; and  

 King's Candy Crush Friends Saga, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise.   

 The Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, completed its inaugural season in 2018 with 12 initial teams. During 2018, we also completed the sale of an additional eight teams, which are competing in the league's second season that began in February 2019.  

  International Sales  

 International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 55%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.  

  Operating Metrics  

 The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.  

  Net Bookings  

 We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. Net bookings is the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.  

 Net bookings was as follows (amounts in millions):

Table of Contents  

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The increase in net bookings for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:   

 higher net bookings from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017;  

 higher net bookings from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite WarfareTM (which, when referred to herein, is inclusive of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare® Remastered), which was released in November 2016;   

 higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, primarily due to in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of  Candy Crush Friends Saga, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018; and  

 net bookings from the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, which was released in November 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.   

 The increase was partially offset by:   

 lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, with no comparable full-game release in 2018;  

 lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016; and   

 lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared to prior catalog releases.    

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in net bookings for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:   

 higher net bookings from King titles, as 2017 included King net bookings for the full year, while 2016 only included King net bookings for the partial period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features;  

 higher net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2;   

 higher net bookings from Call of Duty: WWII, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, the comparable 2016 title;  

 higher net bookings from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles, which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of microtransactions; and  

 net bookings from Crash BandicootTM N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017.   

 The increase was partially offset by:   

 lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared to the performance of  Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title;  

 lower net bookings from Overwatch;  

 lower net bookings from World of Warcraft, driven by the release of  World of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2017; and  

 lower net bookings from the Skylanders® franchise, due to the release of  Skylanders Imaginators in October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

  Monthly Active Users  

 We monitor monthly active users ("MAUs") as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.  

 The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions):  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Average MAUs increased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in Activision's average MAUs is driven by the Call of Duty franchise, due to the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in October 2018. The increase in King's average MAUs is due to the launch of Candy Crush Friends Saga in October 2018.  

 Average MAUs decreased by 29 million, or 8%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in King's average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. King MAUs were also negatively impacted by a King network outage resulting from changes made in the second quarter of 2018 by a third-party partner which inadvertently impacted some users' ability to play and spend money in King games. The year-over-year decrease in Blizzard's average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Hearthstone and Overwatch.  

  Management's Overview of Business Trends  

  Interactive Entertainment Growth, Including Mobile Gaming  

 Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.  

 Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming, and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business

units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.  

  Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games  

 Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.  

 For example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018. During 2018, we also completed the sale of eight additional teams, which are competing in the league's second season that began in February 2019.  

  Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises  

 The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues historically has been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games have been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2018.  

 The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10 console franchises in the U.S. in 2018, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence as of December 2018, the top 10 mobile games have held such ranking for an average of 28 months.  

 In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises. For example, in 2014, we released Hearthstone, and in 2016, we released Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence on the mobile platform, in 2016 we acquired King.  

 Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry's, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors' top franchises can significantly impact our performance.  

  Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality  

 Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.  

41 

          Table of Contents  

 While our business is shifting toward a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. We have historically experienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the calendar year-end holiday buying season. Following the acquisition of King, which focuses on free-to-play games, which are generally less seasonal, and as we otherwise make the shift to a year-round model, less of our revenues are generated during the fourth quarter. For our reportable segments, the aggregate percentage of our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in 2018 was 39%, as compared to 52% in 2013.  

  Outlook  

 In 2019, we expect to have a lighter slate of full game releases than in 2018. We plan to release our latest Call of Duty game in the second half of 2019, along with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled in the first half of 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver ongoing content for our various franchises, including continued in-game content for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, expansion packs for Hearthstone, and in-game events for Overwatch. Overall, we expect lower revenues and earnings per share in 2019 as compared to 2018.  

 We will also continue to invest in new opportunities that we think have the potential to drive our growth over the long-term, including building on our advertising and esports initiatives.  

  Focusing Development Resources and Restructuring Plan  

 In order to better capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, on February 12, 2019, the Company committed to a Board-authorized restructuring plan under which the Company plans to refocus its resources on its largest opportunities and to remove unnecessary levels of complexity and duplication from certain parts of the business. More specifically, we intend to:   

 increase our investment in development for our largest, internally-owned franchisesacross upfront releases, in-game content, mobile and geographic expansion;  

 reduce certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business; and  

 integrate our global and regional sales and "go-to-market," partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business, which we believe will enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.   

 We expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $150 million in 2019, related to severance, including, in many cases, above legally required amounts (approximately 65% of the aggregate charge), facilities costs (approximately 20% of the aggregate charge), and asset write-downs and other costs (approximately 15% of the aggregate charge). We expect the majority of these charges to be incurred in the first quarter of 2019, with most of the balance expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2019. The total pre-tax charge associated with the restructuring will be paid almost entirely in cash and the outlays are expected to be incurred throughout 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Consolidated net revenues   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:   

 an increase of $455 million in revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to (1) higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2, which was released in September 2017, with no comparable release in 2016, and by revenues recognized in connection with the sale of our Destiny publishing rights to Bungie, (2) higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016, (3) higher revenues recognized from  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII, and (4) revenues from the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, which was released in November 2018, with no comparable release in 2017, partially offset by lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared to prior catalog releases; and  

 an increase of $105 million in revenues from King, despite the impact from the network outage in the second quarter of 2018 as discussed above, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise's higher revenues due to in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of Candy Crush Friends Saga, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018.   

 The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $74 million in revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from  Overwatch, which was released in May 2016, partially offset by higher revenues recognized from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.   

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in consolidated net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:   

 higher revenues from King titles, as 2017 included King revenues for the full year, while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features;  

 higher revenues recognized from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles, which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of microtransactions;  

 revenues from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017; and   

 higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: WWII, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, the comparable 2016 title.   

44 

Table of Contents 

 The increase was partially offset by:   

 lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared to the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title; and  

 lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, due to the release of Skylanders Imaginators in October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.   

  Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $625 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2, which was released in September 2017, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016.  

 The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $226 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to a net deferral of revenues for  World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.   

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:   

 a net deferral of revenues for the Destiny franchise, primarily due to Destiny 2, as compared to net deferred revenues recognized in the comparable prior period; and  

 a higher net deferral of revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the stronger performance of Call of Duty: WWII in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare in the fourth quarter of 2016.   

 The decrease was partially offset by:   

 net deferred revenues recognized from Overwatch in 2017, as compared to a net deferral of revenues in 2016 due to the release of Overwatch in May 2016; and  

 net deferred revenues recognized from World of Warcraft in 2017, as compared to a net deferral of revenues in 2016 due to the release of World of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016.   

  Foreign Exchange Impact  

 Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $102 million, a positive impact of $42 million, and a negative impact of $81 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.  

  Operating Segment Results  

 Currently, we have three reportable segmentsActivision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities,

and financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.  

 Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

  Segment Net Revenues  

  Activision   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The decrease in Activision's net revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:   

 lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, with no comparable full-game release in 2018; and  

 lower revenues from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016, as compared to prior catalog releases.   

 The decrease was partially offset by:   

 higher revenues from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to  Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare; and  

 revenues from the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, which was released in November 2018, with no comparable release in 2017.    

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in Activision's net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

 higher revenues from from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles, which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of microtransactions; and  

 revenues from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017.   

 The increase was partially offset by:   

 lower revenues from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare including its associated digital content, as compared to the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title; and  

 lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, due to the release of Skylanders Imaginators in October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.   

  Blizzard   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The increase in Blizzard's net revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from World of Warcraft, driven by World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017, partially offset by lower revenues from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016.

 lower revenues from World of Warcraft, driven by the release of World of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.   

 The decrease was partially offset by:    

 revenues recognized from franchise sales of city-based teams for the Overwatch League; and  

 higher revenues from Diablo III, primarily due to the release of Rise of the Necromancer, a downloadable content pack for Diablo III that was released in June 2017.   

  King   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The increase in King's net revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, driven by in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of Candy Crush Friends Saga, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018.   

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in King's net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:   

 2017 including King revenues for the full year, while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial period following the King Closing Date; and  

 higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features.   

  Segment Income from Operations  

  Activision   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 Activision's operating income for 2018 was comparable to 2017. Decreases in operating income were primarily from:   

 lower revenues, as discussed above;  

 higher developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases; and  

 higher software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses recognized from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017.   

 These were largely offset by increases to operating income from:   

 lower product costs, lower software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and lower sales and marketing costs, all primarily driven by the Destiny franchise, as 2017 included the full game release of Destiny 2, with no comparable full game franchise release in 2018; and  

 higher capitalization of software development costs due to increased costs and the timing of game development cycles.    

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in Activision's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to higher revenues, as discussed above, and lower costs associated with the Skylanders franchise, as there was not a new title released in 2017.  

 The increase was partially offset by higher sales and marketing spend on the Destiny franchise due to the release of Destiny 2.

  Cost of RevenuesProduct Sales:   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The slight decrease in product costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $20 million in product costs from Activision, primarily related to the absence of title releases for the Guitar Hero® and Skylanders franchises, which was partially offset by higher product costs from our lower margin Distribution business due to increased product sales.  

 The increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $89 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to higher software amortization and royalties for (1) the Destiny franchise and (2) Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, partially offset by

  2017 vs. 2016   

 Product costs for 2017, were comparable to 2016, primarily due to lower product costs from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017, offset by higher product costs resulting from the increased revenues of our relatively lower-margin Distribution business.  

 The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:   

 lower software amortization associated with Guitar Hero Live, which was released in October 2015;  

 lower software amortization from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016; and

  Cost of RevenuesSubscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues:   

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to higher personnel, facilities, and equipment costs of $50 million associated with our esports broadcasting operations and online games.  

 The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $121 million in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of King. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $35 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to the release of expansions for Destiny 2.  

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to platform provider fees associated with the increase in revenues from King.

 a decrease of $263 million in amortization of the customer base intangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of King, as the asset was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2018; and  

 a decrease of $49 million in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with (1) the Destiny franchise, due to the release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, with no comparable full-game release in 2018, (2) the Bubble Witch franchise, as  Bubble Witch 3 SagaTM was released during the first quarter of 2017, and (3) Overwatch, partially offset by an increases in marketing spending and personnel costs for the Candy Crush franchise, which had the release of  Candy Crush Friends Saga in October 2018.    

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

Table of Contents  

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:   

 increased personnel costs, including stock compensation expenses, to support the growth in our business and adjacent areas of opportunity;   

 the inclusion of a non-cash accounting charge to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities, with no comparable activity in 2016;  

 restructuring charges, primarily severance costs, incurred in 2017 with no comparable activity in 2016; and   

 higher foreign currency transaction losses.   

 The increase is partially offset by lower transaction costs as 2016 included the King Acquisition.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

  2018 vs. 2017   

 The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:   

 an increase of $41 million in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates as compared to the prior-year period; and  

 a decrease of $22 million in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations due to our lower total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities.    

  2017 vs. 2016   

 The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to our lower total outstanding debt and lower interest rates on our current debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities in 2016 and 2017. See further discussion below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  

  Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

          Table of Contents  

 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1.88 billion, $1.15 billion, and $1.11 billion, respectively, and our income tax expense was $64 million (or a 3% effective tax rate), $878 million (or a 76% effective tax rate), and $140 million (or a 13% effective tax rate), respectively. Our full year 2018 effective tax rate of 3% is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to one-time tax benefits related to the U.S. Tax Reform Act (discussed further below), earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of excess tax benefits from shared-based payments, and research and development ("R&D") credits, partially offset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions.  

 In 2018, 2017, and 2016, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $432 million, $185 million, and $228 million, respectively, and comprised 23%, 16%, and 21%, respectively, of our consolidated income before income tax expense. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our foreign income before income tax expense was $1,445 million, $966 million, and $878 million, respectively, and comprised 77%, 84%, and 79%, respectively, of our consolidated income before income tax expense.  

 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered our effective tax rate by 11 percentage points, 24 percentage points, and 22 percentage points, respectively. The decrease in the foreign rate differential is due to the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.  

 The overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or loss.  

  IRS Closing Agreement  

 On June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements for tax periods starting in 2009 (the "Closing Agreement"). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the second quarter of 2018 and consisted of a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement resulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal tax payments of $334 million were made in October 2018.  

 We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" to be realized in the future. To make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As of December 31, 2017, we had a deferred tax asset for California research and development credit carryforwards ("CA R&D Credits"), which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Closing Agreement impacts historical and prospective filings in certain states, including California, and after considering the impact of the Closing Agreement on its prospective California taxable income, we determined that our remaining CA R&D Credits no longer met the threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $61 million. We will reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.

  U.S. Tax Reform Act  

 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "Transition Tax").  

 On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740. SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts of $636 million for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.  

 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the effect of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an additional tax benefit of $285 million for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. This is primarily related to the election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") and the adjustment for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the U.S. corporate income tax rate reduction. The aggregate U.S. Tax Reform Act impact for 2017 and 2018 is a net tax expense of $351 million, which consists of a $570 million tax expense related to the Transition Tax, partially offset by a net benefit of $219 million, mainly related to the adoption of GILTI deferred tax accounting and remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

 Further analysis of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income taxes, is provided in Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

  Foreign Exchange Impact  

 Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $68 million, a positive impact of $27 million, and a positive impact of $10 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.  

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.4 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.  

 As of December 31, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 billion, as compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings,  

61 

Table of Contents 

we no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily consist of undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested.  

 Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  

 The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale of our products and services. These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.   

  2018 vs 2017   

 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $1.79 billion, as compared to $2.21 billion for 2017. The decrease was primarily due to:   

 higher tax payments, primarily due to payments in the U.S.; and  

 changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.   

 The decrease was partially offset by higher net income in 2018 as compared to 2017.  

62 

Table of Contents  

  2017 vs 2016   

 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $2.21 billion, as compared to $2.16 billion for 2016. The increase was primarily due to:   

 increased earnings after excluding the effects of charges due to impacts from the U.S. Tax Reform Act, which did not result in current year cash outflows, and other non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses;  

 a full year of King operating cash flows; and  

 changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.   

 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 included $145 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to $209 million paid in 2016.  

  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  

 The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.   

  2018 vs 2017   

 Net cash used in investing activities for 2018 was $230 million, as compared to $207 million for 2017. The increase in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher purchases of available-for-sale investments of $209 million for 2018, as compared to $135 million in 2017, partially offset by:   

 higher proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale investments of $116 million in 2018, as compared to $80 million in 2017; and  

 lower capital expenditures of $131 million in 2018, as compared to $155 million in 2017.    

  2017 vs 2016   

 Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 was $207 million, as compared to $4.7 billion for 2016. The decrease in the cash used was primarily due to cash used for the King Acquisition in 2016, with no comparable transaction in 2017. The decrease was partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale investments, net of proceeds from maturities, of $55 million in 2017, with no comparable transactions in 2016.  

  Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities  

 The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.   

  2018 vs 2017   

 Net cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $2.0 billion, as compared to $624 million for 2017. The increase was primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For 2018, we had debt  

63 

Table of Contents 

repayments, inclusive of premium payments, of $1.8 billion, as compared to net debt repayments of $500 million for 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was further impacted by:   

 lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $99 million for 2018, as compared to $178 million for 2017;   

 higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $94 million for 2018, as compared to $56 million for 2017; and  

 higher dividends paid of $259 million for 2018, as compared to $226 million for 2017.    

  2017 vs 2016   

 Net cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $624 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $500 million for 2016. The changes were primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, as compared to approximately $700 million of net debt proceeds, inclusive of a premium payment, for 2016. The cash flows used in financing activities for 2017, were partially offset by:   

 higher proceeds from stock option exercises in 2017 of $178 million, as compared to $106 million for 2016; and   

 lower tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units in 2017 of $56 million, as compared to $115 million in 2016.   

  Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes  

 Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $31 million, a positive impact of $76 million, and a negative impact of $56 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound.  

  Debt  

 As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $2.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.18% and 3.58%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had the following significant activity associated with our debt instruments:   

 on August 16, 2018, using available cash on hand, we redeemed the $750 million of outstanding 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus (2) a "make-whole" premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and (3) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, resulting in a "Loss on extinguishment of debt" recorded in the consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of $25 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $8 million;  

 on August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish our outstanding term loans resulting in a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $7 million, which is included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated statement of operations; and  

 on August 24, 2018, we also entered into the seventh amendment to our Credit Agreement which, among other things, replaced our prior revolving credit facility of $250 million with a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023.

  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  

 At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as "structured finance" or "special purpose" entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.  

  Adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers  

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments. As a result, we have updated our accounting policy disclosures for revenue recognition herein. Refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and see "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" below for further details on the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.  

  Revenue Recognition  

 We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter, action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and "match three." We primarily offer the following products and services:   

 full games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for the console or PC platform;   

 downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game;   

 microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and   

 subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content.   

66 

Table of Contents 

 When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.  

 We determine revenue recognition by:   

 identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;  

 identifying the performance obligations in each contract;  

 determining the transaction price;  

 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and  

 recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.   

 Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales and value-added taxes.  

 Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to 90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.   

  Product Sales   

 Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale of our products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.  

 Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.  

 Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the transaction price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's national circular ad, are recorded as "Sales and marketing" expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service.   

  Products with Online Functionality   

 For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online functionality, such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality are distinct and separable. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on,  

67 

Table of Contents 

including downloadable content. If we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property separate from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the transaction price for the license, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.  

 We recognize revenue for arrangements that include both a license of intellectual property and separate online functionality when control of the license transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly, we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution costs, and software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.   

  Online Hosted Software Arrangements   

 For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period.   

  Subscription Arrangements   

 Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is playable through Blizzard's servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.  

 Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."   

  Licensing Revenues   

 In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license of intellectual property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices, prices charged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. Based on the allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the licensee.  

68 

Table of Contents  

  Other Revenues   

 Other revenues primarily include revenues from downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions, and licensing of intellectual property other than software to third-parties.  

 Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either "consumable" or "durable." Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.  

 Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which may be upfront or over time.   

  Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables   

 Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but also depend on a significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality.  

 Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone selling price we consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer, competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and costs to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin.   

  Estimated Service Period   

 We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our  

69 

Table of Contents 

customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months.   

  Principal Agent Considerations   

 We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft's Xbox Games Store, Sony's PSN, the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether our revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:   

 which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and   

 which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.   

 Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft's Xbox Games Store and Sony's PSN.  

  Income Taxes  

 We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. For those assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.  

 Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.  

 Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will  

70 

Table of Contents 

impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.  

 Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by: (1) changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, (2) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (3) tax effects of nondeductible compensation; (4) tax costs related to intercompany realignments; (5) differences between amounts included in our tax filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses; (6) changes in accounting principles; or (7) changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles or interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.  

 As further described in "Consolidated Results" above, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  

 On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provided guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. As a result, we made an election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to GILTI.  

  Allowances for Returns and Price Protection  

 We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.  

 We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and payment terms, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including achievement of sell-through performance targets, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory, and other market factors.

 Significant management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues must be made and used when establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy.  

 Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title; the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor; or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms. There may be material differences in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2018 allowance for sales returns, price protection, and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $2 million.  

  Software Development Costs  

 Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenuessoftware royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to "Product development."  

 Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenuessoftware royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.  

 We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include:  

72 

Table of Contents 

historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.  

 Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.  

  Fair Value Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present in our consolidated financial statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.  

 There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows; (3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (that is, the risk premium). Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:   

  Business Combinations.   

 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair value. Our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process technology. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.

  Assessment of Impairment of Definite-lived Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.   

 We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances (referred to as a "triggering event") indicate a potential impairment exists. We consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether a triggering event has occurred that could indicate the carrying value of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to: (1) significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; (2) significant changes in the use of the assets; (3) significant negative industry or economic trends; (4) a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and (5) changes in our business strategy. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we determine if an impairment exists based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying values of the related asset group, an impairment exists and the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the group's assets exceeds the fair value of the asset group. We did not record an impairment charge to any of our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018, 2017, or 2016.   

  Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.   

 We are required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and, if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. ASC Topic 350 provides companies an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before performing a quantitative two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. We perform our impairment test for each reporting unit as part of our annual impairment test performed as of December 31. The first step of the quantitative test measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.  

 To determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, as well as on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.  

 In determining the fair value of our significant reporting unitsnamely Activision, Blizzard, and Kingwe assumed discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 9.5% and terminal growth rates of 0.0% to 3.0%, depending on the reporting unit and its specific characteristics and risk profiles. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined the estimated fair value of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2018. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment charges.

 We test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we concluded that no impairment had occurred and that no impairment was reasonably likely to occur. In determining the fair value of these trade names, we assumed a discount rate of 9.5%, and royalty saving rates of approximately 1.5%. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment charges.  

  Share-Based Payments  

 We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for a given grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

 We generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.  

 We generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of the estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock units holder will not participate. Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

  Revenue Recognition  

 As discussed in Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the "new revenue accounting standard"), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018, was $88 million.  

 The most significant impacts of the new revenue accounting standard for us are:    

 The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period, as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacts revenues from most of the titles within our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. The amount of revenue recognized upon delivery of games to our customers is analyzed on a title-by-title basis and may change in the future. For example, the entire sales price from our Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 release is being recognized ratably over an estimated service period, as the gameplay has an increased focus towards the online competitive and cooperative game modes with no single-player campaign mode. Many of our other franchises, such as Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under the new standard is relatively unchanged; and   

 The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.   

 For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

  Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash  

 In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with "Cash and cash equivalents" when reconciling the beginning-of-period and  

76 

Table of Contents 

end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively.  

 We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for impacts on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

  Derivatives and Hedging  

 In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedge's effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.  

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  

  Leases  

 In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Adoption guidance provides for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.  

 This standard is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019, and we will report our adoption in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. Upon adoption, we will elect to apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above. We estimate the impact of adoption to result in the establishment of lease liabilities of approximately $275 million to $325 million, with a similar corresponding impact to total assets. Additionally, we expect that the new disclosure requirements will require us to design and implement additional internal controls over financial reporting, and we are in process of adjusting our processes and internal controls in preparation for adopting the new standard.
