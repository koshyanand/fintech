The following MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K, as well as other information contained in this document.

Key Performance Metrics Used by Management and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As a banking institution, we manage and evaluate aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally. 

The primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income, noninterest income, total revenue, provision for credit losses, noninterest expense, net income and net income available to common stockholders. The primary line items we use in our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases, securities, allowance for credit losses, deposits, borrowed funds and derivatives. 

We consider various measures when evaluating our performance and making day-to-day operating decisions, as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

•Return on average common equity, which we define as annualized net income available to common stockholders divided by average common equity; 

•Return on average tangible common equity, which we define as annualized net income available to common stockholders divided by average common equity excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and average other intangibles; 

•Return on average total assets, which we define as annualized net income divided by average total assets; 

•Return on average total tangible assets, which we define as annualized net income divided by average total assets excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liability) and average other intangibles; 

•Efficiency ratio, which we define as the ratio of our total noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income. We measure our efficiency ratio to evaluate the efficiency of our operations as it helps us monitor how costs are changing compared to our income. A decrease in our efficiency ratio represents improvement; 

•Operating leverage, which we define as the percent change in total revenue, less the percent change in noninterest expense;

•Net interest margin, which we calculate by dividing annualized net interest income for the period by average total interest-earning assets, is a key measure that we use to evaluate our net interest income; and

•Common equity tier 1 capital ratio, which represents CET1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach.

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as “Underlying” or “Adjusted/Underlying” results. Underlying or Adjusted/Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

occur in that period which Management does not consider indicative of the Company’s on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by Management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying or Adjusted/Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying or Adjusted/Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. 

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.

Non-GAAP measures are denoted throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” by the use of the term Underlying or Adjusted/Underlying and/or are followed by an asterisk (*). 

For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations, see “—Key Performance Metrics, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations,” included in this Report.

Net Interest Income

The following table presents the major components of net interest income and net interest margin:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Interest income and rates on loans include loan fees. Additionally, $836 million and $970 million of average nonaccrual loans were included in the average loan balances used to determine the average yield on loans for December 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(2) Balances are net of certain short-term receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements, as applicable. Interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs. See “—Analysis of Financial Condition — Derivatives” for further information. 

47

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Net interest margin of 3.19% increased 17 basis points compared to 3.02% in the year ended 2017, driven by higher interest-earning asset yields given higher interest rates and continued mix shift toward higher-yielding assets. These results were partially offset by the impact of higher deposit and other funding costs. Average interest-earning asset yields of 4.05% increased 49 basis points from 3.56% for the year ended 2017, while average interest-bearing liability costs of 1.19% increased 44 basis points from 0.75% for the year ended 2017. 

Average interest-earning assets of $141.3 billion increased $3.8 billion, or 3%, from the year ended 2017, driven by a $2.5 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases and a $1.7 billion increase in average retail loans, partially offset by a $692 million decrease in average investments and interest-bearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks. Commercial loan growth was driven by commercial and commercial real estate. Retail loan growth was driven by residential mortgage, education and other retail.

Average deposits of $115.9 billion increased $4.0 billion from the year ended 2017, reflecting growth in term deposits, savings, demand deposits, and checking with interest. Total interest-bearing deposit costs of $785 million increased $344 million, or 78%, from $441 million in 2017, primarily due to rising rates. 

Average total borrowed funds of $15.9 billion increased $341 million from the year ended 2017, reflecting an increase in long term borrowed funds, primarily senior debt, partially offset by a decrease in other short-term borrowed funds and a decrease in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements. The total borrowed funds costs of 2.76% increased 80 basis points from 1.96% for the year ended 2017 due to an increase in long-term rates and a mix shift to long-term senior debt.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Noninterest Income

The following table presents the significant components of our noninterest income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes net securities impairment losses on debt securities available for sale recognized in earnings, bank-owned life insurance income and other income. 

(2) 2018 noninterest income amounts reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606).

Noninterest income of $1.6 billion in 2018, increased $62 million, or 4%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2017, driven by strength in mortgage banking fees, reflecting the $57 million impact of FAMC, as well as foreign exchange and interest rate products, trust and investment services fees, card fees and letter of credit and loan fees, partially offset by lower capital market fees and service charges and fees. Excluding the impact of notable items and 2017 aircraft finance lease impairments, Underlying noninterest income* for the year ended 2018 increased $73 million, or 5%.

Provision for Credit Losses

Provision for credit losses of $326 million increased $5 million, or 2%, from $321 million in 2017, which reflected moderately lower reserve growth and partially offset slightly higher net charge-offs. Full year 2018 results reflected a $9 million reserve build, compared to a $16 million reserve build in 2017. Net charge-offs in 2018 of $317 million were $12 million higher compared to 2017. On an Underlying basis,* total credit-related costs decreased $21 million, primarily due to the impact of 2017 aircraft lease impairments.

The provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to “—Analysis of Financial Condition — Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets” for more information.

Noninterest Expense

The following table presents the significant components of our noninterest expense:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense amounts reflect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.

Noninterest expense of $3.6 billion in 2018 increased $145 million, or 4%, compared to 2017, reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits driven by higher revenue-based incentives and merit increases, as well as higher outside services expense, including continued investments to drive growth. Full year 2018 results also reflected 

50

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

$60 million of FAMC costs, primarily in salaries and employee benefits, and $54 million of FAMC integration costs and other notable items. These increases were partially offset by lower other operating expenses. Excluding FAMC integration costs, other notable items and the impact of 2017 aircraft operating lease impairments, Underlying noninterest expense* increased $146 million, or 4%. 

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense of $462 million increased $202 million, or 78%, from $260 million in 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate of 21.2% increased from 13.6% in 2017, primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 Tax Legislation. On an Underlying basis,* the effective income tax rate decreased to 22.5% from 32.2% in 2017, primarily attributable to the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% under the 2017 Tax Legislation, partially offset by an increase in state and local income taxes and non-deductible FDIC premiums. 

At December 31, 2018, our net deferred tax liability of $573 million compared to a $571 million liability at December 31, 2017. The increase in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the tax effect of differences in the timing of deductions and income items for financial statement purposes versus taxable income purposes almost fully offset by the tax effect of the net unrealized losses on securities and derivatives arising during the period. For further discussion, see Note 22 “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included in this Report. 

Business Operating Segments 

The following tables present certain financial data of our business operating segments, Other and consolidated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) We periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments. In first quarter 2018, we

 enhanced our assumptions for the liquidity and deposit components within our FTP methodology which provides a credit for sources of funds and a charge for

 the use of funds by each business operating segment. The enhancement largely provides increased credit for the stability of deposit composition, and an increased

 charge for unused commitments under lending arrangements. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change.

(2) Includes loans held for sale

(3) We revised our method of calculating the loans-to-deposits ratio in third quarter 2018 to exclude loans held for sale. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation.

(4) Includes the financial impact of non-core, liquidating loan portfolios and other non-core assets, our treasury activities, wholesale funding activities, securities portfolio, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense, not attributed to our Consumer Banking or Commercial Banking segments. For a description of non-core assets, see “—Analysis of Financial Condition — Non-Core Assets.”

51

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

We have two business operating segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets, liabilities, capital and related revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses. Non-segment operations are classified as Other, which includes corporate functions, the Treasury function, the securities portfolio, wholesale funding activities, intangible assets, community development, non-core assets (including legacy Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc aircraft loan and leasing), and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense. For a description of non-core assets, see “—Analysis of Financial Condition — Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets — Non-Core Assets.” In addition, Other includes goodwill and any associated goodwill impairment charges. For impairment testing purposes, we allocate goodwill to Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units. 

Our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. Because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing (“FTP”) methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used, or credit for the funds provided, to all business operating segment assets, liabilities and capital, respectively, using a matched-funding concept. The residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management, including the residual net interest income related to the FTP process, is included in Other. We periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments. 

Provision for credit losses is allocated to each business operating segment based on respective actual net charge-offs. The difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business operating segments’ net charge-offs is reflected in Other. 

Noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segment’s operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services. 

Income taxes are assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Other. 

Developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated, or our organizational structure changes.

(3) We revised our method of calculating the loans-to-deposits ratio in third quarter 2018 to exclude loans held for sale. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current period presentation.

Consumer Banking net interest income of $3.1 billion increased $413 million, or 16%, from 2017, driven by the impact of an FTP methodology enhancement as well as the benefit of a $2.3 billion increase in average loans led by residential mortgage, education and unsecured retail with higher loan yields that included the benefit of higher rates and continued mix shift towards higher yielding assets, partially offset by an increase in deposit costs. Noninterest income increased $68 million, or 8%, from 2017, driven by a $57 million increase in mortgage banking fees related to FAMC, and higher trust and investment services fees. Noninterest expense of $2.7 billion increased $130 million, or 5%, from 2017, driven by a $60 million increase related to FAMC, higher salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, outside services, and advertising. Provision for credit losses of $289 million increased $24 million, or 9%, from $265 million for the year ended 2017, reflecting balance growth and seasoning in unsecured retail and education.

Commercial Banking net interest income of $1.5 billion increased $86 million, or 6%, from $1.4 billion for 2017, reflecting a $2.7 billion increase in average loans and leases and a $699 million increase in average deposits. Noninterest income of $545 million increased $7 million, or 1%, from $538 million for 2017, reflecting strength in foreign exchange fees, card fees and letter of credit and loan fees, partially offset by decreases in capital market fees. Noninterest expense of $813 million increased $41 million, or 5%, from $772 million for 2017, largely driven by higher salaries and benefits expense and outside services. Provision for credit losses of $26 million increased $7 million from 2017, driven by higher net charge-offs in 2018.

(2) Balances are net of certain short-term receivables associated with reverse repurchase agreements. Interest expense includes the full cost of the repurchase agreements and certain hedging costs. The rate on federal funds purchased is elevated due to the impact from pay-fixed interest rate swaps that ran off in 2016. See “—Analysis of Financial Condition— Derivatives” for further information. 

57

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Net interest income of $4.2 billion in the year ended 2017 increased $415 million, or 11%, compared to $3.8 billion in the year ended 2016, reflecting 6% average loan growth and a 16 basis point improvement in net interest margin.

Average interest-earning assets of $137.5 billion increased $6.9 billion, or 5%, from the year ended 2016, driven by a $3.0 billion increase in average commercial loans and leases, a $2.9 billion increase in average retail loans, and a $928 million increase in average investments and interest-bearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks. Commercial loan growth was driven by strength in commercial and commercial real estate. Retail loan growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages, education, and other retail balances. 

Average deposits of $111.9 billion increased $6.4 billion from the year ended 2016, reflecting growth in all categories with particular strength in checking with interest and term deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs of $441 million increased $171, or 63%, from $270 million in 2016, primarily due to the impact of rising rates and a slight shift in mix toward commercial deposits. 

Average total borrowed funds of $15.6 billion increased $1.0 billion from the year ended 2016, reflecting an increase in average long-term borrowed funds driven by issuances of senior notes. Total borrowed funds costs of $306 million increased $68 million from the year ended 2016. The total borrowed funds yield of 1.96% in the year ended 2017 increased 34 basis points from 1.62% in the year ended 2016 due to an increase in long-term rates and a mix shift to long-term senior debt. 

Net interest margin of 3.02% increased 16 basis points compared to 2.86% in the year ended 2016, driven by improved loan yields reflecting both higher interest rates and balance sheet optimization initiatives. These results were partially offset by the impact of investment portfolio growth and higher deposit cost and funding costs. Average interest-earning asset yields of 3.56% increased 31 basis points from 3.25% in the year ended 2016, while average interest-bearing liability costs of 0.75% increased 20 basis points from 0.55% in the year ended 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Noninterest Income

The following table presents the significant components of our noninterest income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) In first quarter 2017, certain prior period noninterest income amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations were reclassified to enhance transparency and provide additional granularity, particularly with regard to fee income related to customer activity. These changes had no effect on net income as previously reported.

Noninterest income of $1.5 billion in 2017, increased $37 million, or 2%, compared to 2016 driven by capital market fees, card fees, trust and investment service fees, letter of credit and loan fees and foreign exchange and interest rate products, partially offset by a reduction in service charges and fees, securities gains, mortgage banking fees and other income. Capital market fees increased $58 million, reflecting underlying business momentum and the impact of building capabilities. Card fees increased $30 million from 2016 results. Service charges decreased $6 million and mortgage banking fees decreased $4 million from 2016. On an Adjusted/Underlying basis,* noninterest income increased $98 million, or 7%, compared to 2016.

Provision for Credit Losses

Provision for credit losses of $321 million decreased $48 million, or 13% from $369 million in 2016. The $48 million decrease was primarily due to continued asset quality improvement and the decline in net charge-offs when compared to 2016. The 2017 results reflected a $16 million reserve build, compared to a $34 million reserve build for the full year 2016. Net charge-offs for the full year 2017 of $305 million were $30 million lower compared to the full year 2016.

The provision for loan and lease losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to “—Analysis of Financial Condition — Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets” for more information.

Noninterest Expense

The following table presents the significant components of our noninterest expense:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest expense of $3.5 billion in 2017 increased $122 million, or 4%, compared to 2016. Salaries and benefits increased $52 million, or 3%, driven by merit increases and the impact of hiring associated with strategic growth initiatives. Outside services increased $27 million, or 7%, tied to consumer strategic growth initiatives and technology initiatives. Occupancy expense increased $12 million, or 4%, reflecting costs associated with our branch

strategy, rent and maintenance. Other operating expense increased $21 million, or 4%. On an Adjusted/Underlying basis,* noninterest expense increased $103 million, or 3%, compared to 2016.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense was $260 million and $489 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.6% and 31.9% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 Tax Legislation.

At December 31, 2017, we reported a net deferred tax liability of $571 million, compared to a $714 million liability at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net deferred tax liability was primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of 2017 Tax Legislation. 

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Legislation which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. For Citizens, this required a revaluation of our net deferred tax liability with a corresponding adjustment to current tax expense, and resulted in a $331 million net tax benefit. Included in this net tax benefit was $145 million of expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets associated with unrealized losses in AOCI. FASB standards in-place at December 31, 2017 required us to revalue all deferred taxes, including those related to balances in AOCI, through current tax expense. As a result, our unrealized loss balance in AOCI was not revalued to reflect the new corporate tax rate. This impact, commonly referred to as the “stranded tax effect”, was taken under consideration by FASB in January 2018 to address concerns primarily raised by banking institutions, including distortion of net income and regulatory capital. In February 2018, to address the “stranded tax effect”, FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which provides entities the election to reclassify the difference between the new and old corporate tax rates resulting from the 2017 Tax Legislation between retained earnings and AOCI for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have retrospectively adopted ASU 2018-02, elected to reclassify $145 million between AOCI and retained earnings, including indirect impacts from the decreased federal tax effect on future state tax benefits, and reflected this reclassification in our 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Report.

Consumer Banking net income of $452 million increased $107 million, or 31%, from $345 million in the year ended 2016, as the benefit of a $230 million increase in total revenue more than offset a $46 million increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income of $2.7 billion increased $208 million, or 9%, from the year ended 2016, driven by the benefit of a $3.3 billion increase in average loans driven by residential mortgage, education and retail unsecured categories, partially offset by an increase in deposit costs.

Noninterest income increased $22 million, or 2%, from the year ended 2016, driven by an increase in card fees and investment and trust fees, partially offset by lower service charges and fees and mortgage banking fees. Noninterest expense of $2.6 billion increased $46 million, or 2%, from the year ended 2016, driven by higher outside services, FDIC expense, salaries and benefits, occupancy costs and advertising expense. These results were partially offset by lower credit collection costs and software amortization. Provision for credit losses of $265 million increased $22 million, or 9%, from $243 million in the year ended 2016, largely driven by higher net charge-offs in auto.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Securities

Our securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity, credit quality and market risk while achieving appropriate returns. The following table presents our securities AFS and HTM: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1)As of January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments, Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio decreased $889 million to $23.9 billion, compared with $24.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, primarily driven by net sales of $438 million for liquidity management purposes. 

As of December 31, 2018, the portfolio’s average effective duration was 4.4 years compared with 3.9 years as of December 31, 2017, as higher long-term rates drove a decrease in securities prepayment speeds. We manage the securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book framework and limits.

The securities portfolio includes high quality, highly liquid investments reflecting our ongoing commitment to maintaining appropriate contingent liquidity levels and pledging capacity. U.S. government-guaranteed notes and

At December 31, 2018, we did not identify any concentration of loans and leases exceeding 10% of total loans and leases that were not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases. For further information on how we manage concentration exposures, see Note 5 “Allowance for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Concentrations of Credit Risk” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report. 

Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets

The ACL, which consists of an ALLL and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments, is created through charges to the provision for credit losses in order to provide appropriate reserves to absorb future estimated credit losses in accordance with GAAP. For further information on our processes to determine our ACL, see “—Critical Accounting Estimates — Allowance for Credit Losses,” and Note 5 “Allowance for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Concentrations of Credit Risk” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The qualitative allowance was presented within each loan class beginning in 2017 and prior periods have not been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ALLL represented 1.06% of total loans and leases and 156% of nonperforming loans and leases as of December 31, 2018 compared with 1.12% and 142%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. 

Overall credit quality remained strong, reflecting growth in higher-quality, lower-risk retail loans and a broadly stable risk profile in the commercial loans and leases portfolios. Nonperforming loans and leases of $797 million as of December 31, 2018 decreased $74 million from December 31, 2017, driven by a $64 million decrease in commercial nonperforming loans, mainly due to repayments and returns to accrual status, and a $10 million decrease in retail nonperforming loans, largely in home equity. Net charge-offs of $317 million increased $12 million, or 4%, from $305 million in 2017. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans of 0.28% remained stable compared to 2017.

Risk Elements

The following table presents a summary of nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans and leases by class:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) TDR balances reported in this line item consist of only those TDRs not reported in the nonaccrual loan or accruing and 90 days or more delinquent loan categories. Thus, only those TDRs that are in compliance with their modified terms and not past due, or those TDRs that are past due 30-89 days and still accruing are included in the TDR balances listed above.

Potential Problem Loans and Leases

At December 31, 2018, we did not identify any potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio that were not already included in “—Risk Elements.” Potential problem loans or leases consist of loans and leases where information about a borrower’s possible credit problems cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms.

Commercial Loan Asset Quality 

Our commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of traditional commercial loans, commercial leases and commercial real estate loans. The portfolio is predominantly focused on customers in our footprint and adjacent states in which we have a physical presence where our local delivery model provides for strong client connectivity. Additionally, we also do business in certain specialized industry sectors on a national basis.

73

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

For commercial loans and leases, we utilize regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. Loans with a “pass” rating are those that we believe will be fully repaid in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Commercial loans and leases that are “criticized” are those that have some weakness or potential weakness that indicate an increased probability of future loss. “Criticized” loans are grouped into three categories, “special mention,” “substandard” and “doubtful.” Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of our credit position at some future date. Substandard loans are inadequately protected loans; these loans have well-defined weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. Doubtful loans have the same weaknesses as substandard, with the added characteristics that the possibility of loss is high and collection of the full amount of the loan is improbable. These credit quality indicators for commercial loans are continually updated and monitored. See Note 5 “Allowance for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Concentrations of Credit Risk” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $64 million to $201 million as of December 31, 2018 from $265 million as of December 31, 2017, largely tied to a reduction in nonperforming commodities-related credits. As of December 31, 2018, total commercial nonperforming loans were 0.4% of the commercial loan portfolio compared to 0.5% as of December 31, 2017. Total 2018 commercial loan and lease portfolio net charge-offs of $33 million remained stable with $35 million in 2017.

The recorded investment in commercial loans and leases based on regulatory classification ratings is presented below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total commercial criticized loans and leases of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 were stable compared with December 31, 2017. Commercial criticized loans and leases over total commercial loans and leases of 5.0% at December 31, 2018 improved from 5.4% at December 31, 2017, driven by loan growth. Commercial criticized balances of $2.3 billion, or 5.5% of the commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, increased from $2.1 billion, or 5.7%, as of December 31, 2017. Commercial real estate criticized balances of $500 million, or 3.8% of the commercial real estate portfolio, decreased from $602 million, or 5.3%, as of December 31, 2017. Commercial criticized loans represented 80% of total criticized loans as of December 31, 2018 compared to 75% as of December 31, 2017. Commercial real estate accounted for 18% of total criticized loans as of December 31, 2018 compared to 21% as of December 31, 2017. 

Retail Loan Asset Quality 

For retail loans, we primarily utilize payment and delinquency status to regularly review and monitor credit quality trends. Historical experience indicates that the longer a loan is past due, the greater the likelihood of future credit loss. The largest portion of the retail portfolio is represented by borrowers located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, although we have continued to grow selectively in areas outside the footprint primarily in the auto finance, education lending and unsecured portfolios.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The following tables present asset quality metrics for the retail loan portfolio:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The real estate secured portfolio CLTV is calculated as the mortgage and second lien loan balance divided by the most recently available value of the property.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Retail asset quality remains stable with a net charge-off rate of 0.48% for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of one basis point from the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by growth in credit cards as well as continued expected seasoning in our personal loan and education refinance loan portfolios.

HELOC Payment Shock 

Payment shock in the HELOC portfolio occurs when the 10-year interest only draw period ends, and the payment converts to a fully amortizing principal and interest payment. We monitor the risk associated with the payment increase and have a comprehensive program designed to provide heightened customer outreach to inform, educate and assist customers through the reset process as well as to offer alternative financing and forbearance options. Results of this program indicate that our efforts to assist customers at risk of default have successfully reduced delinquency and charge-off rates compared to our original expectations.

The table below outlines the population expected to mature between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021, compared to the overall HELOC population, reflecting a similar credit profile for each population:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The performance of our historical vintages that have entered repayment remains stable. The following table presents the asset quality metrics as of December 31, 2018, for the HELOCs reset at each year ending:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Factors that affect our future expectations for continued relatively low charge-off risk in the face of rising interest rates for the portion of our HELOC portfolio subject to reset in future periods include a relatively high level of first lien collateral positions, improved loan-to-value ratios resulting from continued home price appreciation, relatively stable portfolio credit score profiles and continued robust loss mitigation efforts.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

TDR is the classification given to a loan that has been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial hardship that we would not otherwise make. TDRs typically result from our loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship. Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet our borrower’s financial needs. The types of concessions include interest rate reductions, term extensions, principal forgiveness and other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside our lending policy. Depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the customer, restructuring can involve loans moving to nonaccrual, remaining on nonaccrual, or remaining on accrual status. 

75

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

As of December 31, 2018, $723 million of retail loans were classified as TDRs, compared with $761 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease was in part, attributable to both loan repayments and the increasing amortization of balances as more seasoned accounts age. As of December 31, 2018, $181 million of retail TDRs were in nonaccrual status with 49% current on payments, stable compared with $211 million in nonaccrual status with 51% current on payments at December 31, 2017. TDRs generally return to accrual status once repayment capacity and appropriate payment history can be established. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and loans, once classified as TDRs, remain classified as TDRs until paid off, sold or refinanced at market terms. 

For additional information regarding TDRs, see “—Critical Accounting Estimates — Allowance for Credit Losses” and Note 5 “Allowance for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Concentrations of Credit Risk” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

Cross-Border Outstandings

Cross-border outstandings can include loans, receivables, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments and other monetary assets that are denominated in either dollars or other non-local currency. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no aggregate cross-border outstandings from borrowers or counterparties in any country that exceeded 1%, or were between 0.75% and 1% of consolidated total assets.

  Non-Core Assets 

The table below presents the composition of our non-core assets:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-core assets are primarily liquidating loan and lease portfolios inconsistent with our strategic priorities, generally as a result of geographic location, industry, product type or risk level and are included in Other. Non-core assets of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 decreased $363 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2017.

Retail non-core loan balances of $875 million decreased $276 million, or 24%, compared to December 31, 2017. The largest component of our retail non-core portfolio is the home equity SBO portfolio, a $503 million portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit purchased between 2003 and 2007 that were initially serviced by other institutions, but now about 45% is serviced internally. The credit profile of this portfolio is stable, and losses have remained in a net recovery position in 2017 and 2018.

Commercial non-core loan and lease balances of $756 million decreased $71 million, or 9%, from $827 million as of December 31, 2017. The largest component of our commercial non-core portfolio is an aircraft-related loan and lease portfolio tied to legacy-Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc aircraft leasing borrowers, which totaled $670 million and $752 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

December 31, 2017 includes $750 million of debt issued under CBNA’s Global Bank Note Program maturing within one year, with unamortized deferred issuance costs and/or discounts of ($1) million and other basis adjustments of ($4) million.

The net decrease in other short-term borrowed funds of $203 million resulted from a reduction of $951 million in short-term FHLB advances partially offset by an increase of $746 million in senior bank debt, issued under CBNA’s Global Note Program, with a remaining maturity within one year.

 Our advances, lines of credit, and letters of credit from the FHLB are collateralized by pledged mortgages and securities at least sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level established by the FHLB. The utilized borrowing capacity for FHLB advances and letters of credit was $13.0 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and our available FHLB borrowing capacity was $4.8 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We can also borrow from the FRB discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. Collateral, including certain loans, is pledged to support this borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2018, our unused secured borrowing capacity was approximately $36.2 billion, which included unencumbered securities, FHLB borrowing capacity, and FRB discount window capacity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. As of December 31, 2018, our primary subsidiaries were CBNA, a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the OCC, and CBPA, a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank regulated by the Department of Banking of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and supervised by the FDIC as its primary federal regulator. On January 2, 2019, we consolidated our banking subsidiaries via a merger of CBPA into CBNA in order to streamline governance and enterprise risk management, improve CBNA’s risk profile and gain operational efficiencies. CBNA is now our primary subsidiary and our sole banking subsidiary. 

Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. The current operating environment reflects heightened regulatory expectations around many regulations including consumer compliance, the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering compliance, and increased internal audit activities. For more information, see “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1 — Business, included in this Report.

Dodd-Frank Act and Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, until the stress testing amendments of EGRRCPA take effect, we are required to submit our annual capital plan and the results of our annual company-run stress tests to the FRB by April 5th of each year and disclose certain results within 15 days after the FRB discloses the results of its supervisory-run tests. EGRRCPA amended the Dodd-Frank Act by, among other things, effective November 24, 2019, removing the requirements for firms with between $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion, such as Citizens, to conduct company-run stress tests and to be subject to supervisory stress testing (although the FRB retains discretion to subject such firms to these requirements). In light of these amendments, the FRB has exempted Citizens from supervisory and company-run stress testing requirements for the 2019 cycle and proposed to conduct supervisory stress tests on a biennial basis and to eliminate company-run stress testing requirements for certain BHCs, including Citizens. We publish estimated DFAST results under the supervisory severely adverse scenario on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.citizensbank.com. On April 5, 2018, we submitted our 2018 Capital Plan, Capital Policy and annual stress test results to the FRB as part of the 2018 CCAR process. On June 28, 2018, the FRB announced that it did not object to our 2018 Capital Plan including our proposed capital actions for the period beginning July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. Our 2018 Capital Plan includes quarterly common dividends of $0.27 per share in third and fourth quarter 2018, increasing to $0.32 per share in first and second quarter 2019, and common share repurchases of up to $1.02 billion through second quarter 2019. While the regulatory landscape of capital planning and stress testing continues to evolve, we maintain a robust inventory of potential actions that could be taken to restore capital, liquidity or both in the event of market or idiosyncratic financial stress. We continue to comply with all regulatory requirements for capital planning and stress testing as well as internal policy governing capital actions. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also required our bank subsidiary to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and to disclose the stress test results. Under EGRRCPA, effective November 2019, banks with total consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, such as CBNA, will not be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. In December 2018, the OCC proposed to implement this change and, if enacted as proposed, we believe that CBNA will not be required to conduct its annual company-run stress tests during 2019. CBNA submitted its 2018 annual stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2018 and published, on our Investor Relations website referenced above, a summary of those results along with the stress test results of the Parent Company on June 21, 2018. 

Similarly, we are required to submit the results of our mid-cycle company-run DFAST stress tests by October 5th of each year to the FRB and disclose the summary results of our internally developed stress tests under the internally developed severely adverse scenario between October 5th and November 4th. We submitted the results of our 2018 mid-cycle stress test to the FRB and disclosed a summary of the results on October 5, 2018. We publish these company-run estimated impacts of stress on our Investor Relations website referenced above. The FRB has proposed to eliminate mid-cycle company-run DFAST stress tests, effective with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle and, as with the other capital planning and stress testing requirements for the 2019 cycle, has exempted Citizens from this requirement for the 2019 cycle.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Capital Framework

Under the U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiaries must meet specific minimum requirements for the following ratios: common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital, and tier 1 leverage. The table below presents our actual regulatory capital ratios under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) “Common equity tier 1 capital ratio” is CET1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach. 

(2) “Tier 1 capital ratio” is tier 1 capital, which includes CET1 capital plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred equity that qualifies as additional tier 1 capital, divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach. 

(3) “Total capital ratio” is total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach.

(4) “Tier 1 leverage ratio” is tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach.

(5) Required “Minimum Capital ratio” for 2018 and 2017 are: Common equity tier 1 capital of 4.5%; Tier 1 capital of 6.0%; Total capital of 8.0%; and Tier 1 leverage of 4.0%.

(6) “Minimum Capital ratio” includes capital conservation buffer for Transitional Basel III of 1.875% for 2018 and 1.250% for 2017; N/A to Tier 1 leverage.

At December 31, 2018, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 10.6%, 11.3% and 13.3%, respectively, as compared with 11.2%, 11.4% and 13.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The CET1 capital ratio decreased as $8.5 billion of risk-weighted asset growth, including $1.5 billion from FAMC, goodwill and intangible growth attributable to the FAMC acquisition, and Capital Plan actions that included common dividends of $471 million, preferred dividends of $29 million and repurchase of $1.025 billion of our outstanding common stock, were partially offset by net income for the year ended December 31, 2018. The tier 1 capital ratio decreased due to the changes in CET1 capital ratio, partially offset by the issuance of preferred stock. The total capital ratio decreased due to the changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios, as well as the June 2018 redemption of subordinated debt and an increase in non-qualifying subordinated debt. At December 31, 2018, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 363 basis points, 275 basis points and 283 basis points, respectively, above their regulatory minima plus the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer. All ratios remained well above the U.S. Basel III minima. 

Regulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition

CET1 capital under U.S. Basel III Standardized rules totaled $14.5 billion at December 31, 2018, and increased $176 million from $14.3 billion at December 31, 2017, as net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by the impact of common share repurchases, dividends and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related to the FAMC acquisition. Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2018 totaled $15.3 billion, reflecting a $769 million increase from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2017, driven by the changes in CET1 capital and the issuance of preferred stock. At December 31, 2018, we had $840 million of fixed-to-floating non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding, an increase of $593 million from $247 million at December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable to the second quarter 2018 issuance of 300,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the fourth quarter 2018 issuance of 300,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, both of which qualified as additional tier 1 capital. Total capital of $18.2 billion at December 31, 2018, increased $376 million from December 31, 2017, driven by the changes in CET1 and tier 1 capital, partially offset by the June 2018 redemption of subordinated debt and an increase in non-qualifying subordinated debt.

83

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) totaled $136.2 billion at December 31, 2018, based on U.S. Basel III Standardized rules, up $8.5 billion from December 31, 2017. This increase was driven by growth in commercial loans and commitments, as well as growth in retail loans including residential mortgages, education and unsecured retail portfolios. The increase in RWA was also driven by the acquisition of FAMC mortgage servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by run-off in the auto and home equity portfolios. 

As of December 31, 2018, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.0% and was stable with December 31, 2017 as the $7.4 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was offset by the increase in tier 1 capital. 

The following table presents our capital composition under the U.S. Basel III capital framework:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) As a U.S. Basel III Standardized approach institution, we selected the one-time election to opt-out of the requirements to include all the components of AOCI. 

(2) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of non-qualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was $139 million and $70 million, respectively.

Capital Adequacy Process

Our assessment of capital adequacy begins with our risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. Capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. The assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Key analytical frameworks, including stress testing, which enable the assessment of capital adequacy versus unexpected loss under a variety of stress scenarios, supplement our base line forecast. A governance framework supports our capital planning process, including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our Capital Contingency Plan and the active engagement of both the legal-entity boards and senior management in oversight and decision-making. 

Forward-looking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the FRB. We prepare this plan in full compliance with the FRB’s Capital Plan Rule and we participate annually in the FRB’s horizontal capital review, which is the FRB’s assessment of specific capital planning areas as part of their normal supervisory process. 

All distributions proposed under our Capital Plan are subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors prior to execution. The timing and exact amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance and market conditions.

Banking Subsidiaries’ Capital

The following table presents our banking subsidiaries’ capital ratios under U.S. Basel III Standardized rules: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) “Common equity tier 1 capital ratio” is CET1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach. 

(2) “Tier 1 capital ratio” is tier 1 capital, which includes CET1 capital plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred equity that qualifies as additional tier 1 capital, divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach. 

(3) “Total capital ratio” is total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach.

(4) “Tier 1 leverage ratio” is tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach.

(5) On January 2, 2019, we consolidated our banking subsidiaries via a merger of CBPA into CBNA.

CBNA CET1 capital totaled $12.0 billion at December 31, 2018, up $77 million from $11.9 billion at December 31, 2017 reflecting net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by dividend payments and an increase in goodwill and intangibles related to the FAMC acquisition. At December 31, 2018, CBNA held minimal additional tier 1 capital. Total capital was $14.3 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $125 million from December 31, 2017, driven by the increase in CET1 capital, and an increase in the ACL. 

CBNA had RWA of $113.6 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.8 billion from December 31, 2017 driven by growth in commercial loans and commitments, as well as growth in retail loans including residential

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

mortgages, education and unsecured retail portfolios. The increase in RWA was also driven by FAMC, which resulted in higher mortgage servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by run-off in the auto and home equity portfolios. 

As of December 31, 2018, the CBNA tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 48 basis points to 9.9% from 10.3% as of December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a $6.4 billion increase in quarterly adjusted average assets that drove a 54 basis point decline in the ratio.

CBPA CET1 capital totaled $3.0 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $19 million at December 31, 2017, as dividend payments exceeded net income. Total capital was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $58 million from December 31, 2017, driven by the decrease in CET1 capital and a decrease in the ACL. 

CBPA had RWA of $22.9 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $737 million from December 31, 2017, driven by decreases in the auto, education, residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in commercial loans.

As of December 31, 2018, the CBPA tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.0%, an increase of 30 basis points from December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a $1.4 billion decrease in quarterly adjusted average assets that drove a 35 basis point increase in the ratio.

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. An institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. As noted earlier, reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity (consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality and liquid securities, and unused FHLB borrowing capacity). Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity (consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality securities). We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength.

We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity, including at the Parent Company and CBNA. 

Parent Company Liquidity 

Our Parent Company’s primary sources of cash are (i) dividends and interest received from CBNA as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and (ii) externally issued preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the following: (i) routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; (ii) needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA, for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and (iii) support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent that the Parent Company has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest.

On January 29, 2019, the Parent Company issued $300 million, or 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 6.350% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual Series D Preferred Stock, par value of $25.00 per share with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). For further discussion, see Note 16 “Stockholders’ Equity” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

For further information on outstanding debt and preferred stock, see Note 12 “Borrowed Funds” and Note 16 “Stockholders’ Equity” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Parent Company declared and paid dividends on common stock of $471 million and $322 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $29 million and $14 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Parent Company repurchased $1.025 billion and $820 million of its outstanding common stock, respectively.

Our Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $911 million as of December 31, 2018 compared with $443 million as of December 31, 2017. The Parent Company’s double-leverage ratio (the combined equity investment in Parent Company subsidiaries 

86

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

divided by Parent Company equity) is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund Parent Company obligations. At December 31, 2018, the Parent Company’s double-leverage ratio was 99%.

CBNA Liquidity 

In the ordinary course of business, the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include (i) deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; (ii) payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and (iii) wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under “—Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.” The primary uses of bank liquidity include (i) withdrawals and maturities of deposits; (ii) payment of interest on deposits; (iii) funding of loans and related commitments; and (iv) funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA’s outstanding debt, see Note 12 “Borrowed Funds” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

CBNA’s major businesses involve taking deposits and making loans. Hence, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and loans. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. 

On February 14, 2019, CBNA issued $1.5 billion in senior notes, consisting of $700 million in three-year fixed-rate notes, $300 million in three-year floating-rate notes, and $500 million in seven-year fixed-rate notes.

Liquidity Risk 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk. 

Contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity’s ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. Drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class. 

Funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity’s ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. Drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or damaged market confidence. 

Factors Affecting Liquidity

Given the composition of its assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity risk at CBNA would be materially affected by such events as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA and the FHLMC), by any inability of the FHLBs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the FRB to act as lender of last resort in systemic stress.

Similarly, given the structure of its balance sheet, the funding liquidity risk of CBNA would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both (e.g., the financial crisis of 2008-2010). However, during the financial crisis, CBNA reduced its dependence on unsecured wholesale funding to virtually zero. Consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest.

87

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

An additional variable affecting our access, and the access of CBNA, to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. The following table presents our credit ratings: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]NR = Not Rated

Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. As a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, CBNA continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding. At December 31, 2018, our wholesale funding consisted primarily of secured borrowings from the FHLBs collateralized by high-quality residential mortgages and term debt issued by the Parent Company and CBNA.

The FRB and the OCC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see “Regulation and Supervision — Financial Regulatory Reform” and “—Liquidity Requirements” in Part I, Item 1 — Business, included in this Report.

Liquidity Risk Management and Governance 

Liquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. In managing liquidity risk, the Funding and Liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies. 

The mission of our Funding and Liquidity unit is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity (to support expected and projected funding requirements), and contingent liquidity (to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements). Additionally, we will deliver this liquidity from stable funding sources, in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost, without significant adverse consequences.

We seek to accomplish this mission by funding loans with stable deposits; by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding; and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. As of December 31, 2018:

•Core deposits continued to be our primary source of funding and our consolidated year-end loan-to-deposit ratio was 97.6%; 

•Our cash position (which is defined as cash balance held at the FRB) totaled $3.0 billion; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Available discount window capacity, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, is secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled $12.3 billion. Use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances. 

88

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows:

•Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash at the FRBs, free and liquid securities and available and secured FHLB borrowing capacity; 

•Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements such as the LCR and the NSFR; and 

•Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. 

Further, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA, and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity, and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon.

Cash flows from operating activities contributed $1.8 billion in 2018, led by net income of $1.7 billion, proceeds from sales of mortgage loans held for sale of $8.1 billion and proceeds from sales of commercial loans held for sale of $1.9 billion, partially offset by originations of mortgage loans held for sale of $8.0 billion and purchases of commercial loans held for sale of $1.9 billion. Net cash used by investing activities was $7.1 billion, primarily reflecting a net increase in loans and leases of $6.4 billion, purchases of debt securities available for sale of $4.3 billion and the acquisition of FAMC, partially offset by proceeds from maturities, paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of $4.3 billion. Cash provided by financing activities was $6.4 billion, driven by proceeds from issuance of long-term borrowed funds of $22.5 billion, a net increase in deposits of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of $593 million, partially offset by repayments of long-term FHLB advances of $14.5 billion and a net decrease in other short-term borrowed funds of $5.2 billion. The $22.5 billion proceeds included $21.8 billion in FHLB advances and $750 million from issuances of medium term debt. These activities represented a cumulative increase in cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion, which, when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.0 billion at the beginning of the year, resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2018.

Cash flows from operating activities contributed $1.9 billion in 2017, led by net income of $1.7 billion, proceeds from sales of mortgage loans held for sale of $3.2 billion and proceeds from sales of commercial loans held for sale of $2.0 billion, partially offset by originations of mortgage loans held for sale of $2.9 billion and purchases of commercial loans held for sale of $2.1 billion. Net cash used by investing activities was $4.0 billion, primarily reflecting a net increase in loans and leases of $3.6 billion and securities available for sale portfolio purchases of $5.4 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities, paydowns and sales of securities available for sale of $4.7 billion. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 billion, driven by proceeds from issuance of long-term borrowed funds of $15.4 billion and a net increase in deposits of $5.3 billion, partially offset by repayments of long-term borrowed funds of $12.8 billion and a net decrease in other short-term borrowed funds of $5.0 billion. The $15.4 billion proceeds included $3.3 billion from issuances of medium term debt and $12.1 billion in FHLB advances. The $12.8 billion of repayments were all related to FHLB advances. These activities represented a cumulative decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $672 million, which, when added to the cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.7 billion at the beginning of the year, resulted in an ending balance of cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. The most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. 

See Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report, for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Management’s estimate of probable losses in our loan and lease portfolios including unfunded lending commitments is recorded in the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported as a component of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our determination of such estimates is based on a periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities, as well as other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments of underlying factors, all of which are susceptible to change.

90

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments could be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. Internal factors include portfolio performance such as delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, the mix and level of loan balances, differing economic risks associated with each loan category and the financial condition of specific borrowers. External factors include fluctuations in the general economy, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, developments within a particular industry, changes in collateral values and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition, business and management performance. The ALLL may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks, factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures. There is no certainty that the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal, external or qualitative factors. There were no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques compared with prior years that impacted the determination of the current year’s ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

The evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial, commercial real estate, and lease ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) and exposure at default on an individual loan basis. The models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience. Additionally, qualitative factors are included in the risk rating models. After the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss, additional overlays can be made based on back-testing against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios.

For nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of $3 million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate TDRs (regardless of size), we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss. If appropriate, a specific ALLL is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses. For all classes of impaired loans, individual loan measures of impairment may result in a charge-off to the ALLL, if deemed appropriate. In such cases, the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists. Techniques utilized include comparing the loan’s carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan’s observable market price. The technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officer’s opinion of the most probable workout scenario. Historically, this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach. The fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. For loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach, a charge-off assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down for declines in value to fair value less cost to sell.

For most non-impaired retail loan portfolio types, the ALLL is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the PD, LGD and exposure at default on an individual loan basis. When developing these factors, we may consider the loan product and collateral type, delinquency status, LTV ratio, lien position, borrower’s credit, time outstanding, geographic location and incurred loss period. Incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually, and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly, as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles. Incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times. Certain retail portfolios, including education, unsecured personal loans, SBO home equity loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate or vintage models to estimate the ALLL. 

For home equity lines and loans, a number of factors impact the PD. Specifically, the borrower’s current FICO score, the utilization rate, delinquency statistics, borrower income, current CLTV ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrower’s creditworthiness. Similarly, LGD is also impacted by various factors, including the utilization rate, the CLTV ratio, the lien position, the Housing Price Index change for the location (as measured by the Case-Shiller index), age of the loan and current loan balance. 

When we are not in a first lien position, we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from third-party credit information providers in the credit assessment. For all first liens, whether owned by a third party or by us, an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis. In this assessment, the most recent three months’ performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency (90 days or more past due), modification, foreclosure and/or bankruptcy statuses. If any derogatory status is present, the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books. This subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the PD model, thus affecting the reserve calculation.

In addition, the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a CLTV. The CLTV is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value, as compared to the LTV from just the junior lien(s). The CLTV is used for modeling both the junior lien PD and LGD. This also impacts the ALLL rates for the junior lien HELOCs.

91

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The above measures are all used to assess the PD and LGD for HELOC borrowers for whom we originated the loans. 

For retail TDRs that are not collateral-dependent, allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows, compared to the recorded investment in the loans. Expected re-default factors are considered in this analysis. Retail TDRs that are deemed collateral-dependent are written down to the fair market value of the collateral less costs to sell. The fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification.

Changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of an appropriate ALLL. For retail loans, losses are affected by such factors as loss severity, collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A one basis point and five basis point increase in the estimated loss rate for retail loans at December 31, 2018 would have increased the ALLL by $6 million and $30 million, respectively. The ALLL for our Commercial Banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates. If 10% and 20% of the December 31, 2018 year end loan balances (including unfunded commitments) within each risk rating category of our Commercial Banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the ALLL would have increased by $99 million and $194 million, respectively.

Commercial loans and leases are charged off to the ALLL when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest. Charge-offs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrower-specific adverse information. For commercial collateral-dependent loans, an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan. Retail loan charge-offs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrower-specific adverse information. When a loan is collateral-dependent, any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off. Placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total charge-off; however, any identified losses are charged off at that time.

For additional information regarding the ALLL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” and Note 5 “Allowance for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets and Concentrations of Credit Risk” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

Fair Value

We measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market, where available. If quoted prices are not available, observable market-based inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value, whenever possible. Such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates.

We classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the three-level valuation hierarchy:

•Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

•Level 3. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market information and that are significant to the fair value measurement.

Classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. For instruments classified in Level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data, there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value. For instruments classified in Level 3, management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data.

We review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on year-end balances. We also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis. This process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes. Any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and, if necessary, valued by an independent outside broker.

92

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method, loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill.

The fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests, external appraisals, broker opinions, recent sales data from industry equipment dealers, and the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying lease agreement. As market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation, these assets are classified as Level 2.

MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. MSRs are classified as Level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs. The fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model which used assumptions, including weighted-average life, prepayment assumptions and weighted-average option adjusted spread. It is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other. Changes in one assumption may result in changes to another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates, may result in changes to discount rates), which could impact sensitivities. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio, and comparisons to market transactions. In addition, the MSR Policy is approved by the Asset Liability Committee. 

For additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see Note 1 “Basis of Presentation,” Note 3 “Securities,” Note 8 “Mortgage Banking,” Note 13 “Derivatives,” and Note 19 “Fair Value Measurements” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

RISK GOVERNANCE

We are committed to maintaining a strong, integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives. A key aspect of our Board’s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. 

To enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the ERC are the following additional committees, covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, Model Risk Committee, Credit Policy Committee, Asset Liability Committee, Business Initiatives Review Committee, and the Ethics Oversight Committee. 

Risk Framework 

Our risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “Three Lines of Defense” model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities. 

First Line of Defense 

The business lines (including their associated support functions) are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide. The business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk. 

Second Line of Defense 

The second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies. This centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks, including credit, market, operational, regulatory, reputational, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks. 

93

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Third Line of Defense 

Our Internal Audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of Citizens’ internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. Internal Audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all Bank records, physical properties and personnel. Internal Audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to Citizens’ Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. 

Credit Quality Assurance reports to the Chief Audit Executive and provides the legal-entity boards, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed Credit Risk Appetite and Credit Policies and processes. In line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the Credit Quality Assurance function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four Risk Pillars of Asset Quality, Rating and Data Integrity, Risk Management and Credit Risk Appetite. 

Risk Appetite 

Risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. We define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations. 

Our principal non-market risks include credit, operational, regulatory, reputational, liquidity and strategic risks. We are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rates, foreign exchange risk and non-trading activities within capital markets. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report on market risk. We actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. See “—Market Risk” for further information. Our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the Board Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk 

Overview 

Credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. While the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. Given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall risk-management responsibility. 

Objective 

The independent Credit Risk Function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products, approving larger and higher risk credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem credit exposures, and ensuring remedial management. 

Organizational Structure 

Management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense. The second line of defense, the independent Credit Risk Function, is led by the Chief Credit Officer who oversees all of our credit risk. The Chief Credit Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer, acting in a manner consistent with Board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. The Chief Credit Officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. Reporting to the Chief Credit Officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, Citizens Restructuring Management, Portfolio and Corporate Reporting, ALLL Analytics, Current Expected Credit Loss, and Credit Policy and Administration. Each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals. 

94

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Governance 

The primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies. These policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite. Material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the Credit Policy Committee, Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee for approval, as appropriate. 

Key Management Processes 

We employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively (i) identify, (ii) measure, (iii) monitor, and (iv) mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit lifecycle (origination, account management/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery). 

Consumer

On the consumer banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the lifecycle of the loan. Starting at origination, credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant. When approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination. 

To ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams, lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter. The amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual. We periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. Only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present. There are exception limits which, when reached, trigger a comprehensive analysis. 

Once an account is established, credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. Our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated, to ensure consistency and efficiency. 

Commercial

On the commercial banking side of credit risk, the structure is broken into C&I loans and leases and CRE. Within C&I loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending, leasing, franchise finance, health care, and technology, mid-corporate). A “specialty vertical” is a stand-alone team of industry or product specialists. Substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. CRE also operates as a specialty vertical. 

Commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies.

Commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. The underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the PD and LGD. All material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority. The approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the PD. The checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. All authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent Credit Risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated. 

The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower’s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. In addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review, our Credit Quality Assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. This group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, and validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management. 

95

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. Concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets (for this purpose defined as our 11 state footprint plus contiguous states), although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. 

Substantially all loans categorized as Classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals.

MARKET RISK

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as loan origination and deposit-gathering. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. 

Non-Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk as a result of non-trading banking activities. This market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk, as we have no direct currency or commodity risk and de minimis equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. We refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or “interest rate risk in the banking book.”

A major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets, on the one hand, and liabilities and equity, on the other. First, there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. For example, the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in LIBOR while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period. There are differences in the drivers of rate changes as well. Loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as LIBOR or Prime, while deposits may be only loosely correlated with LIBOR and depend on competitive demand. Due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates.

Another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. For example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty; and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty. The exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above. 

A primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating rate loans relative to the retail deposit funding. This source of asset sensitivity is more biased to the short end of the yield curve. For the past few years, the FRB has been slowly raising short-term rates to a more neutral stance, and during that time the risk of rising rates seemed biased to the upside and thus we maintained an asset sensitive risk position. As interest rates rose, the risk position became more symmetrical given the possibility of falling rates in the future.

The secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed rate loans as well as the prepayment risk on mortgage related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity. 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. To ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within this risk appetite, we must both measure the exposure and, as necessary, hedge it. The Treasury Asset and Liability Management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on the structural interest rate risk position. These exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the Asset Liability Committee and at Board meetings. 

We measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-term and long-term exposures. The primary method that we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in 

96

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. Exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across scenarios. 

Key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. The most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments. Assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analysis of the impact of key assumptions. The results of these analyses are reported to the Asset Liability Committee.

As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” (implied forward) scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. These scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. Generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized. 

The table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. With rates rising from historically low levels due to Federal Open Market Committee rate increases, exposure to falling rates has increased. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive: net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates. Exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact as demonstrated in the following table.

The table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Asset sensitivity against a 200 basis point gradual increase in rates was 4.9% at December 31, 2018, a slight decrease from 5.1% at December 31, 2017. As the FRB continues to normalize rates, given improved economic growth and data, the upward trend in rates has benefited our net interest income and net interest margin as a result of this asset sensitivity. The risk position can be affected by changes in interest rates which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on prepayable assets. The risk position is managed within our risk limits, and long term view of interest rates, through occasional adjustments to securities investments, interest rate swaps and mix of funding.

We use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”), as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. The change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital.

Capital Markets

97

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

A key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, our potential loss, and sub limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in a formal committee meeting.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

We have market risk associated with the value of residential mortgage servicing right assets (“MSRs”), which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve. We have elected to account for the MSRs acquired from FAMC at fair value while maintaining a lower of cost or market approach on our MSRs held before the FAMC acquisition because the MSRs acquired from FAMC are a separate class of MSRs.

As part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the MSRs acquired from FAMC, we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the MSRs acquired from FAMC was $600 million and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $4.6 billion. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our MSRs held before the FAMC acquisition had a book value of $221 million and $198 million, respectively, and were carried at the lower of cost or market. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, these MSRs had a fair value of $243 million and $218 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying value at those dates. Depending on the interest rate environment, hedges may be used to protect the market value of these MSRs. 

As with our traded market risk based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators, as defined below.

Trading Risk 

We are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities and secondary loan instruments. These trading activities are conducted through our two banking subsidiaries, CBNA and CBPA.

Client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives, financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. In addition to the aforementioned activities, we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients’ transactions and investor clients. We do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short term price differences. 

We record said rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income. Changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income, a component of noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Market Risk Governance 

The market risk limit setting process is established in line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy. This appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to take. Dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise. A dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business and/or trading desk is permitted to operate and this is reviewed at least annually. Dealing authorities are structured to accommodate the client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile. Primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business. Key risk indicators, including VaR, open foreign currency positions and single name risk, are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts.

Market Risk Measurement

We use VaR as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions. Our VaR framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. Risk management VaR is based on a one day holding period to a 99% confidence level, whereas regulatory VaR is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level. Additional to VaR, non-statistical measurements for measuring risk are employed, such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing. 

Our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models for our foreign exchange, interest rate products, and traded loans capture correlation effects and allow for aggregation of market risk across risk types, business lines and legal entities. We measure, monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes. 

VaR Overview

 The market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. The VaR measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (General VaR) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. It is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period. It is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. VaR’s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio. Based on the composition of our “covered positions,” we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading desk’s Specific Risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. The General VaR approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. The internal VaR measure (used as the basis of the main VaR trading limits) is a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period, meaning that a loss greater than the VaR is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). Theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than VaR two to three times per year. The regulatory measure of VaR is done at a 99% confidence level with a ten-day holding period. The historical market data applied to calculate the VaR is updated on a two business day lag. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory Capital” below for details of our ten-day VaR metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, including high, low, average and period end VaR for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, as well as total VaR.

Market Risk Regulatory Capital 

The U.S. banking regulators’ “Market Risk Rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital and substantially modified the determination of market risk-weighted assets and implemented a more risk sensitive methodology for the risk inherent in certain trading positions categorized as “covered positions.” For the purposes of the Market Risk Rule, all of our client facing trades and associated hedges need to maintain a low risk profile to qualify, and do qualify, as “covered positions.” For the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were not subject to the reporting threshold under the Market Risk Rule. As a result, the $785 million and $555 million of calculated market risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our risk-weighted assets. As such, our covered trading activities were risk-weighted under U.S. Basel III Standardized credit risk rules. While not subject to the determination requirements of market risk-weighted assets, we nevertheless comply with the Market Risk Rule’s other requirements. The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR. The following table presents the results of our modeled and non-modeled measures for regulatory capital calculations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1) For the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not meet the reporting threshold prescribed by Market Risk Capital Guidelines.

Stressed VaR 

SVaR is an extension of VaR, but uses a longer historical look-back horizon that is fixed from January 3, 2005. This is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods, but also to provide a counter-balance to VaR which may be low during periods of low volatility. The holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. In addition to risk management purposes, SVaR is also a component of market risk regulatory capital. We calculate SVaR daily under its own dynamic window regime. In a dynamic window regime, values of the ten-day, 99% VaR are calculated over all possible 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory Capital” above for details of SVaR metrics, including high, low, average and period end SVaR for the combined portfolio.

Sensitivity Analysis 

Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures, option prices and credit spreads. Whereas VaR is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations.

Stress Testing 

Conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. For historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other models. Hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold. We generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis. For example, we currently include a stress test that simulates a “Lehman-type” crisis scenario by taking the worst 20-trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into VaR from that period, and assumes they occurred simultaneously. 

VaR Model Review and Validation 

Market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owner. The independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology, market data, and performance. Independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of Citizens’ Model Risk Management and Validation team. Aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used, the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. Where possible, the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models). Results of such reviews are shared with the U.S. banking regulators. The market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior. The Market Risk Management and Validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping.

VaR Backtesting 

Backtesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception. The level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. We perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the Market Risk Rule, and as approved by our banking regulators, for interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange positions. The following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal, modeled VaR for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
