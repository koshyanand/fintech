Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We use derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk on the Sterling Notes, and do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Cross-currency derivative instruments are used to effectively convert £1.275 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt. The cross-currency derivative instruments have maturities of June 2031 and July 2042. We are required to post collateral on the cross-currency derivative instruments when such instruments are in a liability position. In May 2016, we entered into a collateral holiday agreement for 80% of both the 2031 and 2042 cross-currency swaps, which eliminates the requirement to post collateral for three years. The fair value of our cross-currency derivatives included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $237 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For more information, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility debt and floating rate notes was approximately 4.3% and 3.4%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on the senior notes was approximately 5.6% and 5.7%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and 5.4%, respectively. The interest rate on

approximately 85% and 86% of the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):
