PART I

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Tapestry, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading New York-based house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands. Tapestry is powered by optimism, innovation and inclusivity. Our brands are approachable and inviting and create joy every day for people around the world. Defined by quality, craftsmanship and creativity, the brands that make up our house give global audiences the opportunity for exploration and self-expression. Tapestry is comprised of the Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands, all of which have been part of the American fashion landscape for over 25 years. 

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 

Founded in 1941, Coach, Inc., the predecessor company to Tapestry, Inc., was acquired by Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara Lee”) in 1985. In June 2000, Coach, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Maryland. In October 2000, Coach, Inc. was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold approximately 19.5% of the then outstanding shares. In April 2001, Sara Lee completed a distribution of its remaining ownership in Coach, Inc. via an exchange offer, which allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara Lee common stock for Coach, Inc. common stock. During fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Stuart Weitzman Holdings LLC, a luxury women's footwear company. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company acquired Kate Spade & Company, a lifestyle accessories and ready-to-wear company.

During fiscal 2018, the Company changed its name to Tapestry, Inc., a leading luxury lifestyle company with a diverse multi-brand portfolio supported by significant expertise in handbag design, merchandising, supply chain and retail operations as well as solid financial acumen. 

The Company's international expansion strategy has been to enter into joint ventures and establish distributor relationships to build market presence and capability. To further accelerate brand awareness, aggressively grow market share and to exercise greater control of our brands, the Company has historically acquired its joint venture partner’s interests or distribution rights in these international regions. 

Tapestry acquired or obtained operational control of the retail businesses from its distributors or its joint venture partners during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 as follows:

Fiscal 2018

•Coach: Australia and New Zealand

•Stuart Weitzman: Northern China

•Kate Spade: Greater China (including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan)

Fiscal 2019

•Stuart Weitzman: Southern China and Australia

•Kate Spade: Australia, Singapore and Malaysia

Coach

Coach is a leading design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle collections, with a long-standing reputation built on quality craftsmanship. As a pioneer in the leather goods and accessories space, the brand established itself as the original American house of leather. Coach remains inspired by its rich heritage, with the spirit of innovation it has had for more than 75 years. Defined by a free-spirited, all-American attitude, the brand approaches design with a modern vision, reimagining luxury for today with an authenticity that is uniquely Coach. All over the world, the Coach name is synonymous with effortless New York style. We present a sophisticated, modern and inviting environment, both in bricks & mortar stores and online, to showcase our product assortment and reinforce a consistent brand positioning.  

Stores — Coach operates freestanding flagship, retail and outlet stores as well as concession shop-in-shop locations. These stores are located in regional shopping centers, metropolitan areas throughout the world and established outlet centers.

Coach flagship stores, which offer the fullest expression of the Coach brand, are located in tourist-heavy, densely populated cities globally. Retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size, location and customer preferences. Coach outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufactured-for-outlet product and discontinued retail inventory outside the retail channel. The outlet store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brand's image. Through these outlet stores, we target value-oriented customers in established outlet centers that are close to major markets.

To a lesser extent, our e-commerce programs also include our invitation-only outlet flash sales site.

Wholesale — We work closely with our wholesale partners to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation. We enhance our presentation through the creation of shop-in-shops with proprietary Coach brand fixtures within the department store environment. We custom tailor our assortments through wholesale product planning and allocation processes to match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market. We continue to closely manage inventories in this channel given the current highly promotional environment at point-of-sale. We utilize automatic replenishment with major accounts in an effort to optimize inventory levels across wholesale doors.

DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING

Our creative leaders are responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the design direction for our brands across the consumer touchpoints of product, stores and marketing. At Tapestry, each brand has a dedicated design and merchandising team; this ensures that Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman speak to their customers with a voice and positioning unique to their brand. Designers have access to the brands' extensive archives of product designs, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Our designers are also supported by strong merchandising teams that analyze sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season's design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Merchandisers also manage the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising, product development and sourcing specialists help each brand execute design concepts that are consistent with the brand's strategic direction.

Our design and merchandising teams also work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brands. 

MARKETING

We use a 360-degree approach to marketing for each of our brands, synchronizing our efforts across all channels to ensure consistency at every touchpoint. Our global marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent, relevant and multi-layered message every time the consumer comes in contact with our brands through our communications and visual merchandising. Each brand's distinctive positioning is communicated by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, as well as outside creative agencies. We also have a sophisticated consumer and market research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends.

We engage in several consumer communication initiatives globally, including direct marketing activities at a national, regional and local level. Total expenses attributable to the Company's marketing-related activities in fiscal 2019 were $247.1 million, or approximately 4% of net sales, compared to $228.4 million in fiscal 2018, or approximately 4% of net sales. 

Our wide range of marketing activities include direct mail tiered to our database of best, new, lapsed and prospective customers. In addition, to drive engagement and build awareness, we utilize a variety of media, including print, digital, social and out-of-home. Our respective brand websites serve as effective communication vehicles by providing an immersive brand experience, showcasing the fullest expression across all product categories.

As part of our direct marketing strategy, we use databases of consumers to generate personalized communications. Email contacts and direct mail pieces are an important part of our communication and are sent to selected consumers to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. Visitors to our e-commerce sites provide an opportunity to increase the size of these databases, as well as point of transactions globally, except where restricted. For Coach, we have e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Japan, mainland China, several throughout Europe, and South Korea. For Kate Spade, we have e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Japan and throughout Europe. For Stuart Weitzman, we have e-commerce sites in the U.S, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and mainland China. 

In fiscal 2019, Coach had informational websites in Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as a global informational website where other customers are directed. In fiscal 2019, Kate Spade had an informational website in mainland China. The Company utilizes and continues to explore digital technologies such as social media websites, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, WeChat and Sina Weibo, as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase on-line and store sales, acquire new customers and build brand awareness.

MANUFACTURING

Tapestry carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners that have demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. The Company continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the best cost and to mitigate the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. 

Before partnering with a new vendor, the Company evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a recurring basis. We believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with the Company’s integrity standards.

These independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion-oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. 

Our raw material suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards, which are an integral part of our brands' identity. One of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. We have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities.

We maintain strong oversight of the supply chain process for each of our brands from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in Vietnam, mainland China, the Philippines, Cambodia and Spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities.

During fiscal 2019, manufacturers of Coach products were primarily located in Vietnam, Cambodia, mainland China and the Philippines. During fiscal 2019, Coach had one vendor, located in Vietnam, who individually provided approximately 10% of the brand's total purchases. During fiscal 2019, Kate Spade products were manufactured primarily in Vietnam, mainland China and the Philippines. Kate Spade had two vendors, one located in Vietnam and one located in the Philippines, who individually provided 

10

over 10% of the brand's total purchases (or approximately 40% in the aggregate). The Company expects that the level of products manufactured in each country will change during fiscal 2020 as it continues to further diversify the brand’s supply chain globally. Stuart Weitzman products were primarily manufactured in Spain. During fiscal 2019, Stuart Weitzman had three vendors, all located in Spain, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total units (or approximately 30% in the aggregate).

DISTRIBUTION

Each brand's products are shipped from manufacturers to distribution centers around the world for inspection, storage, order processing and shipment. These facilities use bar code scanning warehouse management systems. Our distribution center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes, which allow accurate storage and order processing, and generally provide excellent service to our customers. Each brand's products are primarily shipped to the retail stores and wholesale customers. Some facilities also ship direct to consumer orders in markets where we have an e-commerce presence. 

North America product fulfillment for Coach is facilitated at our U.S. distribution center by our automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of the direct to consumer business are supported by Coach's order management and e-commerce sites. Outside of North America, the Company has established regional distribution centers through third-parties for each brand. For Coach products, these centers are located in the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, mainland China, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Australia and Singapore to support directly operated local markets. 

The Company distributes Kate Spade products through facilities that are operated by third parties in the United States, Europe and Asia. For Kate Spade, product fulfillment in North America is facilitated by our automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of the direct to consumer business are supported by selective warehouse and distribution systems operated by a third-party. The Company also operates local distribution centers through third-parties in the U.K., Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and Malaysia for Kate Spade product.

The Company distributes Stuart Weitzman products through facilities located in the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy and mainland China that are operated by third parties. 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

The Company embarked on a multi-year Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") implementation in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, the Company implemented a global consolidation system which provides a common platform for financial reporting. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company deployed global finance and accounting systems for Corporate, Coach and Stuart Weitzman. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company deployed global finance, accounting, supply chain and human resource information systems for Kate Spade. This project was substantially completed during fiscal 2019, with the remaining supply chain functions for Coach and Stuart Weitzman implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2020. 

The Company is also implementing a point-of-sale system which supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting for each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. The implementation is complete for Coach stores in North America and Europe and expected to be implemented for Stuart Weitzman stores in North America in fiscal 2020 and Kate Spade North America in fiscal 2021.

Refer to Item 1A. "Risk Factors," for further information as it relates to the Company's ERP system implementation efforts. 

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

Tapestry owns all of the material trademark rights around the world used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all branded products for Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade. In addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. Tapestry also owns and maintains registrations in countries around the world for trademarks in relevant classes of products.

Tapestry is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although Tapestry believes that the Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade names are important for its business. In addition, Tapestry owns a number of design patents and utility patents for its brands' products. Tapestry aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the respective online reporting form for each brand, the Tapestry hotline and business partners around the world.

The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them.

SEASONALITY

The Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. During the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the winter and holiday season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. 

Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Most of the Company's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. The Company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. To maximize opportunities, the Company operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. Additionally, the Company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. As a result, the Company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the Company’s products. The Company maintains an internal global trade, customs and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export and regulatory affairs activity.

COMPETITION

The global premium women's and men's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. The Company competes primarily with European and American luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. Over the last several years these industries have grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. This increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories.

EMPLOYEES

As of June 29, 2019, the Company employed approximately 21,000 globally, including both full and part time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees. Of these employees, approximately 10,100 and 7,200 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the global retail field. 

The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.
