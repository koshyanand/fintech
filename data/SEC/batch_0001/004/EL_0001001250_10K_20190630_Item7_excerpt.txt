Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories, which are distributed in approximately 150 countries and territories. The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 and reflects the basis of presentation described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 21  Segment Data and Related Information for all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As a result of ongoing organizational developments and changes, including those arising from our Leading Beauty Forward initiative (as described below) and certain transfer pricing adjustments among our geographic regions, we are reassessing how management reviews the operating performance of these regions, including our travel retail business that is currently reflected in Europe, the Middle East & Africa. This reassessment is expected to be completed by the end of our fiscal 2020 first quarter, which could result in a change in how we present the operating results among our geographic regions in future periods.

The following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company adopted a new accounting standard related to hedging that resulted in gains/losses on our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities to now be reflected in Net sales, where in prior periods they were reflected in Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11  Derivative Financial Instruments. To better assess our performance in a constant currency environment, beginning in fiscal 2019 we are excluding the impact of these hedging activities in our constant currency calculations. The revised calculation did not have a significant impact on constant currency information presented for prior periods and therefore has not been restated.

Overview 

We believe that the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences. Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable. We plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth. 

Our business is focused on prestige beauty, which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with the high-quality products and high-touch services of luxury goods. We are solely focused on prestige beauty, yet we are well diversified by brand, product category, geography, channel, consumer segment and price point. Our innovation capabilities, driven by our creativity and inspired by data analytics and consumer insights, allow us to use our highly desirable brand portfolio to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty. We believe that our broad and inclusive range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumers beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass-market distribution. 

· In fiscal 2019, global prestige skin care continued to lead product category growth. Our skin care business benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as Advanced Night Repair from Estée Lauder and Crème de La Mer from La Mer, as well as recent product launches, the growth in Asia and targeted expanded consumer reach. The launches of Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex and Micro Essence with Sakura Ferment from Estée Lauder were particularly successful in Asia/Pacific. During fiscal 2019, we introduced a new level of personalization with Clinique iD, which allows the consumer to create a custom blend of hydration and treatment. 

· Global prestige makeup sales also continued to grow; however, the pace was slower than in prior years. Our makeup business continued to benefit from growth in hero product lines such as Double Wear from Estée Lauder as well as strong demand for MAC and Tom Ford in Asia and the successful launch of the Cushion Compact from La Mer. 

· Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of our luxury fragrance brands. New products, such as Honeysuckle and Davana from Jo Malone London and Ombre Leather from Tom Ford, as well as strength in certain existing product lines, have contributed to our success in the category. The category also benefited from strong growth and targeted expanded consumer reach of Le Labo and By Kilian. Increased interest in luxury fragrances in China has also helped category growth. We look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category through targeted expanded consumer reach of our luxury brands. 

· In our hair care category, our brands are reaching new consumers globally as we further expanded our presence outside the United States. During fiscal 2019, Aveda launched Cherry Almond Softening Shampoo and Conditioner and relaunched its popular Shampure and Rosemary Mint lines, which also contributed to the categorys growth. 

Our global distribution capability and operations allow us to target opportunities wherever consumer demographics and trends are the most attractive. Our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications. We are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. We tailor our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace cultural diversity. We continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, while broadening our presence in emerging markets. 

· In North America, we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth, despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar retail. In Latin America, we continue to launch new brands, expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products. 

· In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, we are expanding the consumer reach of many of our brands, strengthening their digital and social media presence and leveraging our strength in the makeup category to gain share in prestige beauty. 

· In Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on third-party online malls to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty. 

We approach distribution strategically by product category and geographic region and seek to optimize distribution by matching each of our brands with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door. We are expanding our brands in higher growth channels, such as travel retail and online. We also focus on brand-building retail activities, technology-driven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the luxury experience for consumers.

· As part of this strategy, we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel, positioning us well to leverage the increasing international passenger traffic. Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building due to the increase in traveling consumers, particularly those from emerging markets, who often experience our brands for the first time while traveling. We continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across duty-free locations primarily in airports, downtown stores, in-flight and cruise ships. We engage consumers at the airport through compelling pop-up activations in non-traditional commercial areas, and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments to be relevant to targeted consumer groups. At the same time, travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend. 

· Online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis, and we continue to launch e- and m-commerce sites in new and existing markets directly with our retail customers or on select third-party online malls. We collaborate with our retailers globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites. We believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs. We also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels. 

While our multiple engines of growth have enabled us to produce excellent sales growth, we have also transformed our operations, freeing up resources to invest behind further growth opportunities. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative (described below) has enabled us to cut costs and invest in new capabilities such as digital and data analytics as well as increased advertising. 

In fiscal 2019, we continued to further integrate corporate citizenship and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. Areas of focus include packaging, ingredient transparency, responsible sourcing, energy and emissions, social investments, employee engagement and employee safety. 

While our business is performing well overall, we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries. We are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brick-and-mortar stores in the United States and the United Kingdom. This is due to the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop, as well as adverse macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom. We continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China and the uncertainties caused by the evolving trade policy dispute, which could increase our cost of sales and negatively impact our overall net sales, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. We also continue to monitor the potential implications of the ongoing economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdoms anticipated exit from the European Union (i.e. Brexit) and continue developing our risk mitigation strategies to address such uncertainties. These strategies include changes related to regulatory and legislative compliance, assessing alternatives to supply chain routing, revising customer arrangements and analyzing inventory levels. We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism. Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. 

We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and accelerating areas of strength among our geographic regions, product categories, brands and channels of distribution. However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business. We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business. 

Leading Beauty Forward 

In May 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (Leading Beauty Forward, or the Program) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum. Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value. As of June 30, 2019, we concluded the approvals of all major initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to substantially complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021. We previously estimated that Leading Beauty Forward would result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $900 million and $950 million, before taxes. After concluding the final approvals and reviewing the progress of previously approved initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward that are being implemented, we have revised our estimates for cost approvals under the Program. Inclusive of approvals from inception through June 30, 2019, we now estimate that Leading Beauty Forward may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $950 million and $990 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives. As many of our previously approved Leading Beauty Forward initiatives are progressing through their implementation stages, we are revising our previous estimate of annual net benefits of between $350 million and $450 million, before taxes. After its full implementation, we now expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses and, to a lesser extent, Cost of sales, of between $425 million and $475 million, before taxes. These savings can be used to improve margin, mitigate risk and invest in future growth initiatives. For additional information about restructuring and other charges, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 7  Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities.

Annual Impairment Testing 

We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. During fiscal 2019, our Smashbox reporting unit made revisions to its internal forecasts reflecting the continued slowdown of its makeup business driven by ongoing competitive activity and lower than expected growth in key retail channels for the brand. We concluded that these changes in circumstances triggered the need for an interim impairment review of the Smashbox trademark and the Smashbox reporting unit goodwill. Accordingly, we performed interim impairment tests as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. We concluded that the carrying values of the Smashbox trademark exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows. As a result, we recognized impairment charges totaling $22 million for the trademark in fiscal 2019. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademark, we completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and recorded goodwill impairment charges related to the Smashbox reporting unit totaling $68 million in fiscal 2019. The key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit are predicated on the success of future new product launches, the achievement of international distribution expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. If such plans do not materialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environment in which this reporting unit operates, a resulting change in the key assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and it is possible we could recognize an additional impairment charge. As of June 30, 2019, the remaining carrying values of the Smashbox reporting unit goodwill and Smashbox trademark were $72 million and $55 million, respectively. No further impairment charges were recognized during fiscal 2019. With the exception of the Smashbox reporting unit, fair values of all reporting units with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. 

With regard to trademarks, the fair value of the Smashbox trademark was equal to its carrying value, and the fair values of the Too Faced, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and BECCA trademarks exceeded their carrying values by approximately 7%, 9% and 14%, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the carrying values of the Too Faced, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and BECCA trademarks were $525 million, $32 million and $98 million, respectively. If these reporting units are adversely affected by a softness in the retail environment for their products, or if other business disruptions arise that cause a change to their long-term financial projections, there could be a negative effect on the fair values of the related trademarks, and it is possible we could recognize impairment charges in the future.

Table of Contents 

The fiscal 2019 increase in reported net sales reflected strong growth in our Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, as well as continued growth in the skin care and makeup product categories. International net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in China and Hong Kong, which contributed to the continued growth in our online channel (primarily third-party online malls), while growth in our travel retail business continued to benefit from the increase in international passenger traffic, particularly by Chinese travelers. Skin care net sales reflected growth primarily from Estée Lauder and La Mer products. Net sales increases from Estée Lauder, MAC and Tom Ford, drove the net sales growth in our makeup category. Each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, new product offerings, and the continued success of certain hero franchises. 

The fiscal 2019 reported net sales increase was impacted by approximately $371 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. 

Returns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. Accordingly, the following discussions of Net sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2019 and 2018 impact of returns associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $3 million and $8 million, respectively. 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in the deferral of a portion of product sales primarily related to future obligations (i) to provide gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotional products and (ii) to satisfy customer loyalty program reward obligations, as well as the timing and classification of certain net demonstration payments to and from customers. The collective impact of the adoption of ASC 606 reduced reported net sales for fiscal 2019 by $49 million. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 13  Revenue Recognition. 

Product Categories 

The change in net sales in each product category for fiscal 2019 included the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in an increase (reduction) to net sales, as follows:

Skin Care 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2019, reflecting higher net sales from Estée Lauder and La Mer, combined, of approximately $923 million. The increase in Estée Lauder net sales was led by growth in China and Hong Kong, reflecting the continued strength of existing product franchises, such as Advanced Night Repair, Perfectionist, Nutritious, Micro Essence and Revitalizing Supreme, and new product launches, such as Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex. The increase in net sales from La Mer reflected growth from most markets, led by China and Hong Kong, and benefited from the strength in hero products, such as Crème de la Mer and The Concentrate, other existing products, such as The Treatment Lotion, and targeted expanded consumer reach. The net sales growth from Estée Lauder and La Mer also reflected the increase in Chinese travelers, which led to the brands growth in travel retail and department stores, and higher net sales in our online channel in China (primarily third-party online malls). 

The skin care net sales increase was impacted by approximately $152 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

Makeup 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2019, reflecting higher net sales from Estée Lauder, MAC, Tom Ford and La Mer of approximately $351 million, combined. The higher net sales from Estée Lauder were primarily due to the success of our Double Wear franchise, Futurist Aqua Brilliance and the Pure Color line of products, which drove higher net sales in China, Hong Kong and Korea, as well as in travel retail. The net sales increase from MAC was driven primarily by our Asia/Pacific region, led by China and Hong Kong, as well as the Middle East. The higher net sales in Asia/Pacific was primarily due to targeted expanded consumer reach and the continued strength of lip products in the region. The increase in the Middle East reflected a favorable comparison to the prior year due to the rebalancing of inventory. The increase for MAC also reflected higher net sales in our travel retail business, third-party online malls and the specialty-multi channel. Partially offsetting these increases for the brand were continued declines in the United States primarily due to slower traffic in certain department stores and freestanding stores, as well as lower net sales from the United Kingdom due to overall softness in the makeup category there, continued competitive pressures and adverse macroeconomic conditions. The net sales increase from Tom Ford was driven by higher net sales of lipstick and eyeshadow products in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, and our travel retail business, as well as targeted expanded consumer reach. The higher net sales from La Mer benefited from new products, such as The Luminous Lifting Cushion Foundation, and targeted expanded consumer reach. 

Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales from Clinique and Smashbox of approximately $161 million, combined. The decline in net sales from Clinique reflected the continued declines in the United States, particularly in the department store channel, as well as softness in the makeup category and adverse macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom. The decrease in net sales from Smashbox was due primarily to a soft retail environment for our products in the United States, particularly in the specialty-multi and department store channels, reflecting slower retail traffic. 

The makeup net sales increase was impacted by approximately $161 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. 

Fragrance 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported fragrance net sales decreased in fiscal 2019, reflecting lower net sales from certain of our designer fragrances and Estée Lauder of approximately $110 million, combined, as well as the impact of ASC 606 noted above. The lower net sales from certain of our designer fragrances were primarily due to an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year launch of Michael Kors Sexy Ruby in North America, as well as the challenging retail environment in the United Kingdom. The decrease in net sales from Estée Lauder was primarily due to the change in the mix of products included in the brands holiday blockbuster promotion. 

Partially offsetting these decreases were higher net sales from Jo Malone London, Le Labo and Tom Ford, combined, of approximately $81 million. The increase in net sales from Jo Malone London was driven primarily by growth from our Asia/Pacific region, led by China, due to new product launches and targeted expanded consumer reach, including the brands launch on Tmall. Net sales increased from Le Labo due to the success of existing products and targeted expanded consumer reach globally, which led to strong growth of the brand in our freestanding store and department store channels. The net sales increase from Tom Ford reflected higher net sales from the Private Blend franchise, particularly Soleil Blanc and Oud Wood, and targeted expanded consumer reach.

Reported hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting growth from Aveda, partially offset by lower net sales from Bumble and bumble due to the softness in the salon and specialty-multi channels in North America. The higher net sales from Aveda, particularly in our online channel, was primarily driven by the launch of Cherry Almond Softening Shampoo and Conditioner and continued success of certain hero franchises, such as the Rosemary Mint and Shampure lines of products. 

Geographic Regions 

The change in net sales in each geographic region for fiscal 2019 included the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in an increase (reduction) to net sales, as follows:

The Americas [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported net sales in The Americas decreased in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower net sales in the United States of approximately $218 million, driven primarily by MAC, Clinique, Smashbox and certain of our designer fragrances, as well as the negative impact of the adoption of ASC 606. The net sales decreases from MAC and Clinique were primarily due to the continued traffic declines in department stores, as well as in MAC freestanding stores. The lower net sales from Smashbox reflected the continued slowdown of its makeup business driven by ongoing competitive activity and lower growth in key retail channels for the brand. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher net sales from Le Labo and La Mer due to targeted expanded consumer reach. In addition, net sales in Latin America and Canada, combined, decreased approximately $56 million primarily due to lower net sales from MAC and Clinique, particularly in department stores and freestanding stores. 

The net sales decrease in The Americas included approximately $25 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

Reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business. Net sales increased in our travel retail business across most brands, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer, MAC, Tom Ford and Origins, driven, in part, by an increase in international passenger traffic, particularly by Chinese travelers, as well as strategic investment spend supporting both new and existing products. Also contributing to the increase were targeted expanded consumer reach and new product offerings, such as Estée Lauders Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex. 

Partially offsetting the net sales increase were lower net sales in certain Western European markets, primarily reflecting challenging environments in Benelux, Germany, France and Iberia, as well as lower net sales in the United Kingdom, primarily driven by competitive pressures and adverse macroeconomic conditions. These decreases were approximately $116 million, combined. 

The net sales increase in Europe, the Middle East & Africa included approximately $216 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. 

Asia/Pacific 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported net sales in Asia/Pacific increased in fiscal 2019, reflecting higher net sales in China and Hong Kong of approximately $574 million, combined. The higher net sales in China, led by Estée Lauder, MAC and La Mer, reflected continued growth from the strong demand for skin care and makeup products that benefited virtually every channel, particularly online (primarily third-party online malls), department stores, freestanding stores and specialty-multi. The net sales growth in Hong Kong, also led by Estée Lauder, La Mer and MAC, reflected a strong retail environment due to increased tourism, particularly from Chinese travelers, targeted expanded consumer reach and the continued success of certain hero franchises. 

The net sales increase in Asia/Pacific included approximately $130 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. 

We strategically time our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.

GROSS MARGIN 

Gross margin in fiscal 2019 decreased to 77.2% as compared with 79.2% in fiscal 2018. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2019 primarily reflected the net impact of the adoption of recently issued accounting standards. For more information see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 11  Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 13  Revenue Recognition. The favorable impact from our mix of business primarily reflected favorable changes in the shipments of promotional items, strategic pricing and product category mix, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from new product introductions. 

OPERATING EXPENSES 

Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased to 61.6% as compared with 64.2% in fiscal 2018. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses improved as compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting favorable impacts from the adoption of ASC 606 and selling expenses, primarily in North America due to lower demonstration costs, partially driven by changes in distribution channel mix, as well as efficiencies in our sales operations. These improvements were offset by increases in advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased spend to support digital advertising and social media (including costs associated with influencers), locally relevant promotions, new product launches, and targeted expanded consumer reach.

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported operating margin in fiscal 2019 increased by approximately 60 basis points as compared to fiscal 2018, driven by improvements in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and lower charges associated with restructuring and other activities, partially offset by the lower gross margin, as previously noted. Partially offsetting the increase in operating margin was the unfavorable impact of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments. 

The changes in fair value of contingent consideration and the fiscal 2019 goodwill and intangible asset impairments impacted the operating results of our product categories and geographic regions as follows: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. Accordingly, the following discussions of Operating income by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2019 and 2018 impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities of $241 million, or 2% of net sales and $257 million, or 2% of net sales, respectively. 

The adoption of ASC 606, as discussed above, increased operating income for fiscal 2019 by $21 million.

Skin Care 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reported skin care operating income increased in fiscal 2019, primarily from Estée Lauder and La Mer, due to higher net sales. Partially offsetting these increases were higher advertising and promotional activities primarily due to increased spend to support digital advertising and social media (including costs associated with influencers), locally relevant promotions, new product launches and targeted expanded consumer reach. 

Makeup 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 37 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 

Reported makeup operating income decreased in fiscal 2019, driven by lower results from Smashbox, BECCA and Too Faced, combined, of approximately $207 million. The lower results from Smashbox reflected the decline in net sales, as well as $90 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments. The decrease in operating income from BECCA primarily reflected lower net sales, as well as an increase in advertising and promotional expenses to support new product launches. The lower results from Too Faced primarily reflected higher cost of sales due, in part, to new product introductions. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher results from Estée Lauder primarily due to higher net sales and greater selling efficiencies. 

Fragrance 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reported fragrance operating income decreased in fiscal 2019, driven by lower results from Jo Malone London and certain of our designer fragrances, combined, of approximately $29 million. The increase from Jo Malone London net sales was more than offset by higher expenses due, in part, to increases in cost of sales reflecting a change in product mix, as well as increases in advertising and promotional activities and store operating costs related to targeted expanded consumer reach. The lower results from certain of our designer fragrances reflected lower net sales, partially offset by disciplined expense management and selling efficiencies in North America.

Reported hair care operating income decreased in fiscal 2019 due to lower results from Bumble and bumble and Aveda. The lower results from Bumble and bumble reflected lower net sales. The decrease in operating income from Aveda was primarily due to increases in cost of sales; advertising and promotion expenses due to spending to support the brands social media and digital campaign activity, new product launches and digital advertising; and shipping expenses due to the net sales increases in our online channel. 

Geographic Regions 

The change in operating income in each geographic region for fiscal 2019 included the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in an increase (reduction) to operating income, as follows:

Reported operating income in The Americas decreased in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower net sales in the region, the goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to Smashbox and investments in information systems and enhanced capabilities in select corporate functions to support our strategic initiatives. This was partially offset by lower selling expenses due to lower demonstration costs, partially driven by changes in distribution channel mix, as well as efficiencies in our sales operations.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense and Interest income and investment income, net increased in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher interest rates. Also contributing to the increase in Interest income and investment income, net were higher average investment balances. 

OTHER INCOME, NET 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, presented us with opportunities to manage cash and investments more efficiently on a global basis. Accordingly, during fiscal 2019, as part of the assessment of those opportunities, we sold our available-for-sale securities, which liquidated our investment in the foreign subsidiary that owned those securities. As a result, we recorded a realized foreign currency gain on liquidation of $77 million and a gross loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities of $6 million, both of which were reclassified from accumulated OCI and are reflected in Other income, net. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Currency Translation and Transactions for further information. 

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 

The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of share-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies. In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change. 

The TCJA includes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 8  Income Taxes for further discussion relating to the TCJA. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (1) All periods exclude the net impact on the effective tax rate of charges associated with restructuring and other activities and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. Fiscal 2019 was adjusted for the impact of the goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, the gain on liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, net, and the finalization of the TCJA provisional charges recorded in fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 was adjusted for the impact of the provisional charges resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.    

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 decreased approximately 2,140 basis points. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impacts from the TCJA recognized in the prior year including the Transition Tax, the adjustment to U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the statutory tax rate reduction, including the enactment date remeasurement, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings. The collective impact of these charges is approximately 2,260 basis points. An additional 40 basis point reduction is primarily related to the collective net impact of the provisions of the TCJA which became effective in fiscal 2019 including the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate, a foreign derived intangible income deduction (FDII) and a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Partially offsetting these decreases were approximately 100 basis points due to an increase in income tax reserve adjustments and approximately 60 basis points relating to the nondeductible Smashbox goodwill impairment charge.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Companys underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period. In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the Companys results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The following tables present Net sales, Operating income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities; goodwill and other intangible asset impairments; the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; the gain on liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, net; the Transition Tax; the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets as of the TCJA enactment date; the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings resulting from the TCJA; and the effects of foreign currency translation. The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview 

Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,987 million compared with $2,181 million at June 30, 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions. To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure. 

Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities. 

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available-for-sale securities, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. 

The TCJA resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax. During fiscal 2018, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings, and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2019 includes $1,765 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions. 

The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.

Credit Ratings 

Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility. Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. As of August 16, 2019, our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poors and A2 with a stable outlook by Moodys. 

Debt and Access to Liquidity 

Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 44% at June 30, 2019 from 43% at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the decrease in total equity reflecting higher treasury stock purchases and dividends, partially offset by higher net earnings. 

For further information regarding our current and long-term debt and available financing, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 10  Debt. 

Cash Flows 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in net cash flows from operating activities primarily reflected higher cash paid for taxes, higher international inventory levels to support our forecasted sales activity, an increase in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections and an unfavorable change in accounts payable due to the timing and level of payments. These changes were partially offset by higher earnings before taxes. 

The change in net cash flows from investing activities primarily reflected higher proceeds from the sale of investments and lower purchases of investments, primarily due to the liquidation of our foreign subsidiary that owned our available-for-sale securities. 

The change in net cash flows from financing activities primarily reflected higher treasury stock purchases and dividend payments in the current year, as well as changes in short-term debt reflecting the repayment of remaining commercial paper borrowings. 

See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for the fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017 comparative discussions. 

Dividends 

For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the year ended June 30, 2019 and through August 16, 2019, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 16  Common Stock. 

Pension and Post-retirement Plan Funding 

Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans. For our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Qualified Plan), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages. For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (ERISA) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions. The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions. 

For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities. This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio. For fiscal 2019 and 2018, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan. As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2020.

Commitments and Contingencies 

Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions. These provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. 

For additional contingencies refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 15  Commitments and Contingencies (Contractual Obligations). 

Contractual Obligations

Credit Risk 

For a discussion of credit risk, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 11  Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk). 

Market Risk 

We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net increase in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $48 million and $(10) million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. 

In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $16 million and $24 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2019 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Companys financial condition. Our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes. 

Management of the Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. 

Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets  Impairment Assessment 

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. 

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The single quantitative step test requires companies to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We early adopted this guidance as of the fiscal 2019 second quarter. When testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. For fiscal 2019 and 2018, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. For our other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, a quantitative assessment was performed. We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. 

For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 

Income Taxes 

We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. As the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.

Table of Contents 

We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings. 

For further discussion of our Income Taxes accounting policy, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including in this and other filings with the SEC, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders, which may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
