Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of Welltower Inc. presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in “Item 1 — Business” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above.

Executive Summary

Company Overview

Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower™, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.

The following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Represents consolidated NOI and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliation.

Business Strategy

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, resident fees/services and rental income represented 69% and 29%, respectively, of total revenues. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan, and any interest rate adjustments.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Our primary sources of cash include resident fees/services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, our commercial paper program, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.

We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $215,376,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $100,753,000 of restricted cash and $1,853,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.

The dividend declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 represents the 191st consecutive quarterly dividend payment.

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.

Operating Performance We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”) per the Statement of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”), consolidated net operating income (“NOI”) and same store NOI (“SSNOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Credit Strength  We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) section 1031 deposits. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations, and rating of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Concentration Risk  We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our various property types. Relationship mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our top five relationships. Geographic mix measures the portion of our NOI that 

42

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

relates to our top five states (or international equivalents). The following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by NOI for the years indicated below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities and non-segment/corporate NOI. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.

(2) Revera owns a controlling interest in Sunrise Senior Living. 

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in “Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to “Item 1 — Business,” “Item 1A — Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.

Corporate Governance

Maintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today’s business environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include resident fees/services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

43

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities  The change in net cash provided from operating activities is attributable to changes in NOI, which is primarily due to acquisitions and annual rent increasers, partially offset to dispostions. Please see “Results of Operations” below for further discussion. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.

Investing Activities The changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments, real estate loans receivable, and investments in unconsolidated entities which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 3, 6, and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position, and/or achieve property stabilization. Generally, these expenditures have increased as a result of acquisitions, primarily in our Seniors Housing Operating segment.

Financing Activities  The changes in net cash provided from financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2018, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 50%. We use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. At December 31, 2018, we had fourteen outstanding letter of credit obligations. Please see Notes 7, 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our payment requirements under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

(5) See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(6) Primarily relates to payments to be made under a supplemental executive retirement plan for one former executive officer.

Capital Structure

Please refer to “Credit Strength” above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

On May 17, 2018, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (1) an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. As of February 13, 2019, 8,526,222 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration statement. On August 3, 2018, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution agreements with each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated; Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC; UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $784,083,001 aggregate amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf Program”). The Equity Shelf Program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements. We expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive per share cash proceeds at settlement equal to the forward sale price under the relevant forward sale agreement. However, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. As of February 13, 2019, we had $227,958,000 of remaining capacity under the Equity Shelf Program and there were no outstanding forward sales agreements. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.

 Results of Operations

Summary

Our primary sources of revenue include resident fees/services,rent and interest income. Our primary expenses include interest expense, depreciation and amortization, property operating expenses, other expenses and general and administrative expenses. We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and SSNOI and other supplemental measures include FFO and Adjusted EBITDA, which are further discussed below. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations. The following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

Seniors Housing Operating 

 The following is a summary of our NOI and SSNOI for the Seniors Housing Operating segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Relates to 348 same store properties.

(2) Primarily relates to the acquisition of 66 properties subsequent to January 1, 2016 and the transition of 69 properties from Triple-net to Seniors Housing Operating.

The following is a summary of our results of operations for the Seniors Housing Operating segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

(2) See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

Fluctuations in resident fees/services and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions, segment transitions and the movement of U.S. and foreign currency exchange rates. The fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. The decrease in other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily a result of insurance proceeds received during 2017 relating to a property as well as a bargain purchase gain recognized in conjunction with a single property acquisition. 

During the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The fluctuations in gains (losses) on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. Beginning January 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized 

47

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

as a component of purchase price. The increase in other expenses since 2016 are primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed two seniors housing operating construction projects representing $86,931,000 or $459,952 per unit and one expansion project totaling $2,672,000. The following is a summary of our Seniors Housing Operating construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense represents secured debt interest expense which fluctuates based on the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The following is a summary of our Seniors Housing Operating property secured debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. The fluctuations in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities are largely due to the recognition of impairments related to one of our investments in unconsolidated entities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Losses are also attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived intangible assets related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures.

Triple-net 

The following is a summary of our NOI and SSNOI for the Triple-net segment for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Relates to 364 same store properties.

(2) Primarily relates to the acquisition of 264 properties and 40 properties sold or held for sale at December 31, 2018.

The following is a summary of our results of operations for the Triple-net segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

(2) See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

The 2017 and 2018 decreases in rental income are primarily attributable to the disposition of properties exceeding new acquisitions, segment transitions and the reduction in the Genesis HealthCare ("Genesis") annual cash rent obligation due to the restructuring of the master lease as of January 1, 2018. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the CPI do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 17 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.18% to 0.76% in our triple-net portfolio. The decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during the three years presented. The increase in other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to $10,805,000 of net lease termination fees recognized.

Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties exceeding acquisition and segment transitions. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

The provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies” below and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded provision for loan losses related to certain first mortgage loans to Genesis of $62,966,000 and $6,935,000, respectively.

During the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The fluctuations in gains on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. Beginning January 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. 

49

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Other expenses primarily represents noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions, segment transitions and the termination/restructuring of pre-existing relationships. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an other than temporary charge of $18,294,000 in other expenses on the Genesis available-for-sale equity investment.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed two triple-net construction projects totaling $90,055,000 or $283,472 per bed/unit and two expansion projects totaling $17,357,000. The following is a summary of triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The fluctuation in loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment recorded on the Genesis available-for-sale investment in accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our Triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A portion of our triple-net properties were formed through partnerships. Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

Outpatient Medical 

The following is a summary of our NOI and SSNOI for the Outpatient Medical segment for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED](1) Relates to 212 same store properties.

(2) Primarily relates to the acquisition of 48 properties and the conversion of 15 construction projects into revenue-generating properties subsequent to January 1, 2016.

The following is a summary of our results of operations for the Outpatient Medical segment for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

(2) See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

The fluctuations in rental income are primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties, offset by dispositions. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the CPI. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the CPI does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 77,850 square feet of new leases and 184,349 square feet of renewals. The weighted-average term of these leases was seven years, with a rate of $36.23 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $21.90 per square foot. Substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 3.9%.

The fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities, offset by dispositions. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. During 2016 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges related to certain held-for-sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell. Changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices. 

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed one outpatient medical construction project representing $11,358,000 or $296 per square foot. The following is a summary of outpatient medical construction projects pending as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The following is a summary of our Outpatient Medical secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A portion of our outpatient medical properties were formed through partnerships. Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following is a summary of our non-segment/corporate interest expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments. Please refer to Note 10 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. The change in interest expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2016 is due to the early extinguishment of the 2017 senior unsecured notes.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 2.69%, 2.83% and 3.63%, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses since 2016 is primarily related to a reduction in professional service fees for tax and legal consulting and compensation costs as a result of execution of our strategic initiatives. 

Other expenses for 2017 primarily represents $40,730,000 of costs related to finalization of an agreement with the University of Toledo Foundation to transfer our corporate headquarters as a donation. Other expenses for all years also includes severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees. 

The fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to benefits recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the release of a valuation allowance reserve on a taxable subsidiary and the restructuring of an unconsolidated investment. The decrease in preferred dividends and the preferred stock redemption charge are due to the redemption of our 6.5% Series J preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Other

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.

Consolidated net operating income (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical facility properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses, and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (“SSNOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the reporting period subsequent to January 1, 2016. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties acquired, developed /redeveloped, transitioned, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.

EBITDA stands for earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization, and preferred dividends. Covenants in our senior unsecured notes and primary unsecured credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to those agreements. Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above excluding unconsolidated entities and adjusted for items per our covenant. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.

The table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to NICS, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. Noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization, gains/loss on real estate dispositions and impairments of assets. Amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

(1) Certain severance-related costs are included in stock-based compensation and excluded from other expenses.

Our leverage ratios include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents and any IRC section 1031 deposits), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization. The table below reflects the reconciliation of our leverage ratios to our balance sheets for the periods presented. Amounts are in thousands, except share price.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:

•the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and

•the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. However, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.

The following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans. If this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement or if it has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to income accrual status.

The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and value of the underlying collateral. Any loans with collectability concerns are subjected to a projected payoff valuation. The valuation is based on the expected future cash flows and/or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The valuation is compared to the outstanding balance to determine the reserve needed for each loan. We may base our valuation on a loan’s observable market price, if any, or the fair value of collateral, net of sales costs, if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the collateral.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risk. Substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed and/or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. We recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days’ notice.

We evaluate the collectability of our revenues and related receivables on an on-going basis. We evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the financial strength of the investment’s underlying operations as measured by cash flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and guaranties, and current economic conditions.

If our evaluation indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset to revenue.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

An impairment charge must be recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.

The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment. These indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the property level, the tenant’s inability to make rent payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life, and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of impairment exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely uses of the property are compared to the current net book value. This analysis requires us to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during the period the property is expected to be held. Properties that meet the held-for-sale criteria are recorded at the lesser of fair value less costs to sell or carrying value.
