(UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE, DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) 

Overview

Frutarom acquisition

On October 4, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Frutarom Industries Ltd. (“Frutarom”). We acquired 100% of the equity of Frutarom pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger entered into on May 7, 2018. Frutarom is an Israeli company that, through its subsidiaries, develops, produces and markets tastes, flavors and fine ingredients used in manufacturing food, beverages, flavors and fragrances, pharma/nutraceuticals, cosmetics and personal care products, primarily focused on natural products. The acquisition was made in order to strengthen and broaden our customer base, capabilities and geographic reach, and is expected to result in exposure to more end markets, including those with a focus on naturals and health and wellness. 

The consideration paid to Frutarom shareholders was funded with (i) borrowings under our term loan credit agreement, (ii) amounts received from our offering of common stock that closed in September 2018, (iii) amounts received from our offering of TEUs that closed in September 2018, (iv) amounts received from our offering of €1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured euro-denominated notes that closed in September 2018, (v) amounts received from our offering of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured U.S. dollar-denominated notes that closed in September 2018 and (vi) the issuance of approximately 14.9 million shares of our common stock, which resulted in former Frutarom shareholders holding approximately 14.0% of our outstanding common stock at closing.

The transaction was valued, based on our stock price as of October 4, 2018, at approximately $7 billion, including the assumption of approximately $695 million of Frutarom's net debt, which we repaid concurrent with the closing of the transaction. Frutarom's operating results have been included in our operating results from October 4, 2018.

Company background

We are a leading innovator of sensory experiences that move the world. We co-create unique products that consumers taste, smell, or touch. Our expanded geographical footprint and product portfolio position us to better serve both our global customers and the growing regional, mid-sized and smaller specialty customers. 

Through the acquisition of Frutarom, we increased our product portfolio with complementary adjacencies, such as natural colors, anti-oxidants for food preservation, nutraceuticals, ingredients for infant formula and proteins for elderly nutrition, and expanded core product lines with savory solutions aimed at the meat and fish industry, citrus and other naturals flavors, specialty ingredients and new cosmetic actives. As a result, we now have over 90,000 products within our portfolio that are provided to customers in approximately 195 countries, which includes a significant number of faster-growing small and mid-sized customers.

The 2018 combined sales of IFF and Frutarom, which combines the full year 2018 sales of both Frutarom and IFF, was approximately $5.1 billion which, management believes, makes us the second largest company in the taste, scent and nutrition industry. We expect that our combined cultures of innovation and partnership will allow us to further capitalize on this expansion to continue to offer our customers innovative and differentiated products. Based on our 2018 combined sales, approximately 35% of our customers are global consumer products companies while approximately 65% of our customers are small and mid-sized companies.

During the past few years, through acquisitions and the development of Tastepoint, we have leveraged our expertise to expand our North American mid-sized customer base. With the acquisition of Frutarom, which was principally focused on serving small and mid-sized companies globally, we have significantly increased our exposure to these faster-growing customers. 

We operate in three business segments, Taste (previously "Flavors"), Scent (previously "Fragrances") and, commencing upon its acquisition, Frutarom. In 2018, our Taste business represented 44% of our sales, our Scent business represented 47% of sales and Frutarom represented 9% of sales. Based on our 2018 combined sales, our Taste business represented 34% of sales, our Scent business represented 36% of sales and Frutarom represented 30% of sales. 

We are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known consumer products within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries products. Our Scent 

 36

business consists of Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients. Our Fragrance Compounds are defined into two broad categories, Fine Fragrances and Consumer Fragrances. Consumer Fragrances consists of five end-use categories of products: (1) Fabric Care, (2) Home Care, (3) Personal Wash, (4) Hair Care and (5) Toiletries. Fragrance Ingredients consist of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, and are included in the Scent business unit. 

Flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used. As a leading creator of Flavor Compounds, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. While we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. Consequently, we manage our flavors business geographically, creating Flavor Compounds in our regional creative centers which allow us to satisfy local taste preferences, while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards. We develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers, most of which are tailor-made. We continually develop new formulas to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs. Our Flavor Compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four end-use categories of consumer goods: (1) Savory, (2) Beverages, (3) Sweet and (4) Dairy.

Our Frutarom business creates and manufactures a naturals-focused suite of Flavor Compounds and specialty fine ingredients, largely targeting small, local and regional customers. Our Frutarom business seeks to capitalize on the health and wellness emphasis of consumers and deliver growth by offering customers natural flavor products that combine solutions to create natural colors, extending shelf life and natural functional food ingredients. Frutarom’s products are focused on three principal areas: (1) Savory Solutions, (2) Natural Product Solutions, which includes natural health ingredients, natural color and natural food protection, and (3) Taste Solutions.

2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Sales in 2018 increased 17% on a reported basis and 15% on a currency neutral basis (which excludes the effects of changes in currency), with the effects of the Frutarom acquisition contributing approximately 11% to reported growth rates and 10% to currency neutral growth rates. Taste achieved reported sales growth of 6% and currency neutral sales growth of 5%. Scent achieved sales growth of 6% on a reported basis and 4% on a currency neutral basis in 2018. From a geographic perspective, North America ("NOAM"), Europe, Africa and Middle East ("EAME"), Greater Asia ("GA") and Latin America ("LA") all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis in 2018, led by EAME. 

Overall, our 2018 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 48% of total sales and experienced 17% growth on a reported basis and 16% growth on a currency neutral basis in 2018. We continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of products and geographies and had sales growth in our Taste and Scent business units. Both Taste and Scent benefited from new win performance (net of losses). Exchange rate variations did not have a material impact on revenue in 2018. The effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in U.S. dollars versus local currencies. We saw currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2018.

Our 25 largest customers accounted for 47% of total sales in 2018; this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years. Sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 9% to 12 % of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. A key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to win new business. We are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within flavors and fragrances.

 37

Gross margin decreased 102 basis points ("bps") year-over-year, driven primarily by unfavorable price versus input costs (including the net impact of the BASF supply disruption), which was only partially offset by cost savings and productivity initiatives. Included in 2018 was $23.6 million of Frutarom acquisition related inventory "step-up" costs, $1.7 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.1 million of integration related costs, offset by $7.1 million income from net insurance recoveries from the previously disclosed FDA mandated product recall, compared to $15.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $11.0 million related to the FDA mandated product recall, $1.8 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.5 million of integration related costs in 2017. Excluding these items, adjusted gross margin decreased 142 bps compared to the prior year period.

Operating profit increased $31.3 million to $583.9 million (14.7% of sales) in 2018 compared to $552.6 million (16.3% of sales) in 2017. Included in 2018 were Frutarom acquisition related costs of $89.6 million, integration related costs of $7.2 million, restructuring and other charges of $4.1 million and operational improvement initiative costs of $2.2 million, partially offset by $7.1 million in income from net insurance recoveries from the previously disclosed FDA mandated product recall, acquisition related costs of $1.3 million and gain on sale of fixed assets of $1.2 million. Included in 2017 were restructuring and other charges of $19.7 million, acquisition-related costs of $20.4 million, $11.0 million relating to an FDA mandated product recall, reserve for payment of a tax assessment related to commercial rent for prior periods of $5.3 million, integration related costs of $4.2 million, pension settlement charges of $2.8 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $1.8 million and an additional charge related to litigation settlement of $1.0 million, partially offset by gain on sale of fixed assets of $0.2 million. Excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $677.4 million for 2018, an increase from $618.6 million for 2017, principally driven by volume growth, the impact of foreign exchange, and cost and productivity initiatives which was partially offset by price to input costs (including the impact of the BASF supply chain disruption) and increases Selling and administrative expenses. Foreign currency had a 3% favorable impact on operating profit in the 2018 period compared to a 1% unfavorable impact on operating profit in the 2017 period. Operating profit as a percentage of sales, excluding the above charges, decreased from 17.0% for 2018 compared to 18.2% for 2017, principally driven by lower margins as a result of price to input costs (including the net impact of the BASF supply chain disruption) and increases in Selling and administrative expenses, offset by cost and productivity initiatives and new win performance (net of losses)

Cash flows from operations were $437.6 million or 11.0% of sales in 2018 as compared to cash flows from operations of $390.8 million, or 11.5% of sales, during 2017. The increase in operating cash flows in 2018 as compared to 2017 was principally driven by lower litigation settlement and pension payments and higher net income, offset by higher net working (principally related to inventories).

Our capital spend was $170.1 million (4.3% of sales) during 2018. In light of our requirement to begin relocating one of our Fragrance Ingredients facilities in China, the ongoing construction of new facilities in India and Indonesia, and capital 

 38

requirements to integrate our recently acquired Frutarom business, we expect that capital spending in 2019 will be about 5-6% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).

Effective the first quarter of 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and the presentation of pension costs. The revenue recognition guidance was adopted effective the first day of fiscal 2018 and prior period amounts were not revised to conform to the new guidance. The adoption of the new revenue guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations. The guidance related to the presentation of pension costs was applied retroactively and prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the new guidance. As noted in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the net effect of the change was to decrease operating profit and increase Other income.

2019 OUTLOOK

We believe that market conditions and the macro-economic environment will continue to be volatile in many markets in 2019 but that overall, there will be slight improvements as compared to recent years. Pressures from increasing costs and the impact of supply chain disruptions related to key ingredients used in the flavors and fragrance industry may reduce our currency neutral operating profit growth in 2019.

During 2018, the raw material cost environment continued its recent upward trend. We believe that, for the next several quarters, we will continue to see higher costs of raw materials across a range of categories. Raw material costs continue to be impacted by supply chain disruptions, mainly impacting our Scent business unit. We continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance, cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement as well as integration savings with Frutarom.

On a long-term basis, we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long-term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. We believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ businesses.

Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute approximately 50% of total inventory. R&D expenses relate to the development of new and improved molecules and technologies, technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations. S&A expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities.

2018 IN COMPARISON TO 2017 

Frutarom's operating results have been included in our operating results from October 4, 2018.

Sales

Sales for 2018 totaled $4.0 billion, an increase of 17% from the prior year on a reported and 15% on a currency neutral basis. Sales growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) and favorable price to input costs in both Taste and Scent. On a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of the acquisition of Frutarom was approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, to net sales amounts.

Sales performance by segment was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________

(1)Currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2018 period.

Taste

Taste sales in 2018 increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period. Overall growth was primarily driven by new win performance (net of losses) and price increases (principally due to increases in raw material input costs). The Taste business delivered currency neutral growth across all regions. 

Sales growth in the Taste business unit was led by NOAM, which were primarily driven by new wins and price increases (principally due to increases in raw material input costs), and followed by EAME. GA and LA sales growth was primarily driven by new wins.

Scent

Scent sales in 2018 increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on a currency neutral basis. Year-over-year, 2018 sales growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) and price increases (principally due to increases in raw material input costs), which were partially offset by volume reductions on existing business. 

Sales growth in the Scent business unit was led by Ingredients, which were primarily driven by price increases (principally due to increases in raw material input costs), followed by Fragrance Compounds, primarily driven by new wins partially offset by volume reductions on existing business.

Frutarom

Frutarom sales in 2018 were $359.6 million, which included approximately $264 million in sales of Flavor Compounds and approximately $97 million in sales of Ingredient product categories.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, increased 102 bps, to 57.7% in 2018 compared to 56.7% in 2017. Included in cost of goods sold was $23.6 million of Frutarom acquisition related inventory "step-up" costs, $1.7 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives, and $0.1 million of integration related costs, partially offset by $7.1 million related to an FDA mandated product recall, in 2018. For 2017, included in costs of goods sold was $15.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $11.0 million related to an FDA mandated product recall, $1.8 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives, and $0.5 million of integration related costs.

 41

Research and Development (R&D)

Overall R&D expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 7.8% in 2018 compared to 8.7% in 2017. The decrease in 2018 was principally driven by the effect of the acquisition of Frutarom which has a lower R&D spend as a percent of sales.

Selling and Administrative (S&A)

S&A expenses increased $137.3 million to $707.5 million, or 17.8% as a percentage of sales, in 2018 compared to $570.1 million, or 16.8% as a percentage of sales, in 2017. Included in 2018 were Frutarom acquisition related costs of $66.1 million and integration related costs of $6.1 million, partially offset by acquisition related costs of $1.3 million, compared to commercial real estate tax assessment charges of $5.3 million, acquisition and integration related costs of $4.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, UK pension settlement charge of $1.9 million and net legal charges/credits, principally related to a litigation accrual of $1.0 million in 2017. Excluding these costs, adjusted S&A expense increased by $82.5 million, but decreased to16.0% of sales in 2018 compared to 16.3% of sales in 2017. The improved leverage is principally due to a decline in personnel related costs and the impact of our acquisition of Frutarom.

Restructuring and Other Charges

Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2017 Productivity Program

On February 15, 2017, the Company announced that it was adopting a multi-year productivity program designed to improve overall financial performance, provide flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and drive long-term value creation. In connection with this program, we expect to optimize our global footprint and simplify the Company's organizational structures globally.

The Company recorded $3.9 million and $20.6 million of charges related to personnel-related costs in 2018 and 2017, respectively, with no further anticipated personnel-related and other costs after the first quarter of 2019. The Company made payments of $7.3 million and $14.0 million related to severance in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The overall charges were split approximately evenly between Taste and Scent. No charges were allocated to the Frutarom segment. This initiative is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 370 members of the Company’s global workforce, including acquired entities, in various parts of the organization.

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles

Amortization expenses increased to $75.9 million in 2018 compared to $34.7 million in 2017. The increase of $41.2 million is principally due to the acquisition of Frutarom.

Operating Results by Business Unit

We evaluate the performance of business units based on segment profit which is defined as operating profit before Restructuring and certain non-recurring items, Interest expense, Other expense, net and Taxes on income. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes.

(1)Includes $23.6 million related to amortization of inventory "step-up" costs.

Taste Business Unit

Taste segment profit increased $34.7 million to $395.2 million (22.7% of segment sales) in 2018 from $360.5 million (22.1% of segment sales) in the comparable 2017 period. The increase principally reflected the impact of cost savings and productivity initiatives and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by increases in Selling and administrative expenses.

Scent Business Unit

Scent segment profit increased $10.6 million to $329.5 million in 2018, compared to $319.0 million reported in 2017 primarily due to new win performance (net of losses) and price increases (principally due to increases in raw material input costs), which were partially offset by volume reductions on existing business. Segment profit as a percentage of segment sales decreased to 17.5% in 2018 from 18.1% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of unfavorable price versus input costs (including the net impact of the BASF supply chain disruption) and increases in R&D and Selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by new win performance (net of losses).

Frutarom Business Unit

Frutarom segment profit was $27.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 (7.6% of segment sales), excluding $23.6 million related to amortization of inventory "step-up" costs.

Global Expenses

Global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and R&D and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2018, Global expenses were $74.7 million compared to $60.8 million during 2017. The increase was principally driven by lower gains from our currency hedging program, offset by reductions in incentive compensation expense.

 43

Interest Expense

In 2018, interest expense increased $67.2 million to $132.6 million, compared to $65.4 million in 2017 primarily driven by $39.4 million of bridge loan commitment fees and $7.7 million of accrued, unpaid interest on the repurchased Senior Notes - 2007 and increased interest expense related to the public debt issued in 2018 to finance the acquisition of Frutarom. Average cost of debt was 4.3% for the 2018 period compared to 4.1% in 2017. 

Other (Income) Expense, Net

Other income, net, decreased approximately $14.5 million to $35.2 million of income in 2018 versus $49.8 million of income in 2017. The decrease was largely driven by decreases in gains on foreign currency of approximately $8 million year over year as well as a decrease in pension related other net income. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $38.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. The loss on extinguishment of debt is driven by a $34.9 million make whole payment on the Senior Notes - 2007 and a $3.9 million realized loss on the termination of a fair value hedge.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 24.1% in 2018 as compared to 44.9% in 2017. The year-over-year reduction principally relates to lower U.S. tax reform charges in 2018, partially offset by nondeductible Frutarom acquisition costs, an unfavorable mix of earnings, lower loss provisions, and a lower level of reversals of valuation allowances on U.S. state deferred taxes. Excluding $25.3 million related to the U.S. tax reform, Frutarom acquisition costs of $28.5 million, FDA mandated product recall costs of $1.6 million, integration related costs of $1.4 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $1.0 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $0.7 million, gain on sale of assets of $0.4 million and acquisition related costs of $0.3 million, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2018 was 18.4%. For 2017, the adjusted tax rate was 20.7% excluding $139.2 million related to the impact of the U.S. tax reform, legal charges/credits, net of $0.4 million, acquisition related costs of $6.5 million, gain on sale of assets of $0.1 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $0.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $5.5 million, FDA mandated product recall costs of $3.9 million, UK pension settlement charge of $0.5 million, tax assessment of $1.9 million, and integration related costs of $1.3 million.

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that significantly revised the U.S. tax code effective January 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21% and establishing a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the Act also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of such earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Tax Act impacted the Company's consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter. In particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system required the Company to record a one-time tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of $100.6 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on non-U.S. subsidiaries. The cash portion of the "toll charge" is payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of $38.6 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. 

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an additional charge of $0.6 million to adjust an accrual related to withholding taxes on planned repatriations. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first installment of the “toll charge”. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a benefit of $8.0 million to adjust the provisional “toll charge” required from the transition to the new territorial tax system, and a benefit of $0.2 million to adjust the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of U.S. tax reform. During the fourth quarter, the Company completed its final assessment under SAB 118, and recorded an additional charge of $32.8 million to adjust an accrual related to the U.S. state impact and foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriations. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 is consistent with the Company's need to repatriate funds for debt repayment purposes.

2017 IN COMPARISON TO 2016

Sales

Sales for 2017 totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Sales growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) and the effects of acquisitions in both Taste and Scent. On both a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of acquisitions was approximately 5% to net sales amounts.

Sales performance by segment was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________

(1)Currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2018 period.

Taste

Taste sales in 2017 increased 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 5% of the net sales growth on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Overall growth was primarily driven by new win performance (net of losses) and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by decreases in volume. Globally, Taste growth included mid single-digit growth in emerging markets. Overall, emerging markets represented approximately 49% of total Taste sales. 

Sales growth in Taste was led by NOAM followed by EAME, LA and GA, all primarily driven by new win performance (net of losses).

Scent

Scent sales in 2017 increased 9% on both a reported basis and currency neutral basis. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 5% of both reported and currency neutral sales growth. Year-over-year, 2017 sales performance was led by new win performance (net of losses) and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by decreases in price. Globally, Scent growth included low single-digit growth in emerging markets. Overall, emerging markets represented 47% of total Scent's sales. 

Sales growth in Scent was led by Ingredients, primarily driven by price increases (principally due to increases in raw material input costs), followed by growth in Fragrance Compounds, primarily driven by new wins (net of losses) partially offset by volume reductions on existing business. 

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, increased 146 bps, to 56.7% in 2017 compared to 55.2% in 2016. Included in cost of goods sold was $15.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $11.0 million related to an FDA mandated product recall, $1.8 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives, and $0.5 million of integration related costs, in 2017. For 2016, included in costs of goods sold was $7.6 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $2.4 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.7 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation.

Research and Development (R&D)

R&D expenses, as a percentage of sales, remained relatively consistent with the prior year period at 8.7% in 2017 compared to 8.3% in 2016. The slight increase in 2017 was principally driven by recent acquisitions, and, to a lesser extent, incentive compensation.

Selling and Administrative (S&A)

S&A, as a percentage of sales, decreased 160 bps to 16.8% versus 18.4% (or 16.3% and 16.6% on an adjusted basis in 2017 and 2016, respectively). Included in 2017 were commercial real estate tax assessment charges of $5.3 million, acquisition and integration related costs of $4.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, UK pension settlement charge of $1.9 million and net legal charges/credits, principally related to a litigation accrual of $1.0 million, compared to net legal charges/credits, 

 45

principally related to a litigation accrual of $48.5 million, acquisition related costs of $4.5 million and severance costs related to the termination of a former executive officer of $1.4 million in 2016. During 2017, costs were higher as a result of recently acquired companies, offset by slightly lower legal and professional fees associated with various finance initiatives, and decreases in legal and patent fees.

Restructuring and Other Charges

Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles

Amortization expenses increased to $34.7 million in 2017 compared to $23.8 million in 2016. The increase of $10.9 million is principally due to the acquisitions of Fragrance Resources and PowderPure in 2017, as well as recognizing a full year of amortization in 2017 from the acquisition of David Michael as compared to 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Taste Business Unit

Taste segment profit increased $30.3 million to $360.5 million in 2017 (22.1% of segment sales) from $330.2 million (22.1% of sales) in the comparable 2016 period. The increase in segment profit and profit margin principally reflected productivity initiatives and solid top-line growth.

 46

Scent Business Unit

Scent segment profit decreased $7.8 million to $319.0 million in 2017 (18.1% of segment sales), compared to $326.7 million (20.2% of sales) reported in 2016. The decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by the impact of acquisitions and unfavorable price versus input costs, partially offset by volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives.

Global Expenses

Global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and R&D and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2017, Global expenses were $60.8 million compared to $48.4 million during 2016. The increase was principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs.

Interest Expense

In 2017, interest expense increased $12.4 million to $65.4 million, compared to $53.0 million in 2016 reflecting the impact of our issuance of Senior Notes - 2017 in the second quarter of 2017. Average cost of debt was 4.1% for the 2017 period compared to 3.8% in 2016. 

Other (Income) Expense, Net

Other income, net increased approximately $26.0 million to $49.8 million of income in 2017 versus $23.8 million of income in 2016. The increase was largely driven by gains on foreign currency of approximately $13 million in the current year versus approximately $5 million in the prior year, as well as proceeds from certain life insurance policies of approximately $4 million in 2017.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2017 as compared to 22.7% in 2016. Excluding $139.2 million related to the U.S. tax reform, legal charges/credits, net of $0.4 million, acquisition related costs of $6.5 million, gain on sale of assets of $0.1 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $0.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $5.5 million, FDA mandated product recall costs of $3.9 million, UK pension settlement charge of $0.5 million, tax assessment of $1.9 million, and integration related costs of $1.3 million, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 20.7%. For 2016, the adjusted tax rate was 23.8% excluding $17.1 million, $4.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million of tax benefits associated with pretax legal charges/credits, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs, respectively, as well as a $2.7 million tax charge related to the gain on sale of property. The year-over-year reduction principally reflects the reversal of certain valuation allowances on U.S. state deferred taxes.

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that significantly revised the U.S. tax code effective January 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21%, limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation, transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations.

The Tax Act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods. In particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system required us to record a one-time tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of $100.6 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on non-U.S. subsidiaries. The cash portion of the "toll charge" will be payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of $38.6 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Tax Act and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB, the Company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. Other provisions of the Tax Act that impact future tax years are still being assessed. Any material revisions in the Company's computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations.

Based on our current assessment and understanding of the Tax Act and the Company’s current global operating structure, the Company believes its effective tax rate will be approximately 21% in 2018. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional 

 47

guidance that may be issued by the taxing authorities as well as operating and/or structural changes that the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

We had cash and cash equivalents of $634.9 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $368.0 million at December 31, 2017, of which $434.6 million of the balance at December 31, 2018 was held outside the United States. Cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the United States. 

Effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy. We regularly repatriate cash from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the U.S. These repatriations totaled $155.1 million, $192.2 million and $134.5 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued were subject to U.S. tax and will not be subject to additional U.S. federal tax when repatriated. However, such distributions could be subject to foreign withholding or other taxes, including state taxes. We have repatriated $155.1 million during 2018 and anticipate repatriating amounts in the future to provide for the cash needs of our U.S. operations and to repay debt. We anticipate the relevant foreign withholding and other taxes, including state taxes, to be approximately $88.8 million and have recorded the deferred tax liabilities accordingly.

RESTRICTED CASH

As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, restricted cash of $13.6 million relates to amounts escrowed related to certain payments to be made to former Frutarom option holders in future periods.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 

Operating cash flows in 2018 were $437.6 million compared to $390.8 million in 2017 and $550.1 million in 2016. The increase in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2018 was principally driven by lower litigation settlement and pension payments and higher net income, offset by higher net working capital (principally related to inventories). The decrease in operating cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 was principally related to the impact of increased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable) and due to payments on legal claims along with severance, integration and acquisition costs.

Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $1.81 billion at year-end 2018 compared to $1.13 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase in working capital of $685.8 million primarily reflected increases in accounts receivable and inventory offset by increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities as compared to the prior year. 

We sold certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. We believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies. We estimate that, as a result of participating in the programs, the beneficial impact on cash provided by operations decreased approximately $16.9 million in 2018, compared to an increase of approximately $7.6 million and $34 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.

CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES 

Net investing activities in 2018 utilized $5.0 billion compared to $299.9 million and $355.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash paid for investing activities was primarily driven by higher payments for acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired Frutarom for approximately $7 billion (net of cash acquired) of which $4.9 billion was paid in cash. In 2017, we acquired Fragrance Resources and PowderPure for approximately $137.5 million (net of cash acquired) and $54.2 million (net of cash acquired), respectively, in addition to a purchase price adjustment of $0.7 million related to David Michael in 2017.

Additions to property, plant and equipment were $170.1 million, $129.0 million and $126.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). These investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with customer demand, primarily in emerging markets, and new technology consistent with our strategy.

In light of our requirement to begin relocating one of our Fragrance Ingredients facilities in China, the ongoing construction of new facilities in India and Indonesia, and capital requirements to integrate our recently acquired Frutarom 

 48

business, we expect that capital spending in 2019 will be about 5-6% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). 

CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 increased to $4,870.7 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $42.6 million and $34.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018 versus 2017 was principally driven by Frutarom related financing activities where we issued $3.3 billion of debt, including €1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Euro Senior Notes, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2018 USD Senior Notes, $139.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Amortizing Note portion of the TEUs and $350 million aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, as compared to $493.9 million of 2047 Notes issued in 2017. We also issued $2.3 billion of equity in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the Frutarom acquisition, including $1.6 billion of our common stock and $685.5 million of the stock purchase contract portion ("SPC") of the TEUs. Additionally, we repaid $288.8 million of our Senior notes - 2007, including the loss on extinguishment of debt of $38.8 million.

At December 31, 2018, we had $4,553.1 million of debt outstanding compared to $1,639.2 million outstanding at December 31, 2017.

We paid dividends totaling $230.2 million, $206.1 million and $184.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cash dividend declared per share in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2.84, $2.66 and $2.40, respectively. 

Our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating. We will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long term plans. The company is also committed to maintaining its history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our Board of Directors (“Board”) at its discretion based on various factors, and finally will be very selective in pursuing value creating strategic M&A over the near term.

In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2013. In August 2015, the Board of Directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through December 31, 2017. Based on the total remaining amount of $279.7 million available under the amended repurchase program as of October 31, 2017, the Board of Directors re-approved on November 1, 2017 a $250.0 million share repurchase authorization and extension for a total value of $300.0 million available under the program, which expires on November 1, 2022. Based on the total remaining amount of $280 million available under the repurchase program, approximately 2.1 million shares, or 1.9% of shares outstanding (based on the market price and shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018) could be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2018. On May 7, 2018, we announced that we were suspending our share repurchases until our deleveraging target is met following our acquisition of Frutarom.

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities will sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. We believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements.

As discussed above and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in connection with our acquisition of Frutarom, we repaid the $250 million outstanding principal amount of the Senior notes - 2007, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $7.7 million and a make whole payment of $34.9 million and $3.9 million realized loss on the termination of a fair value hedge, in addition to $695 million of Frutarom's net debt concurrent with the closing of the transaction. In the next three years, we expect to reduce our net debt by repaying our outstanding liabilities upon maturity using the proceeds from operating cashflows and from the suspension of our share repurchase program. 

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired Frutarom for approximately $7 billion (net of cash acquired). The cash portion of the consideration was approximately $5 billion, which was funded from the proceeds from issuing $3 billion in net new debt, issuing $2.3 billion in equity. We also issued of treasury shares worth $2.1 billion.

During the second quarter of 2017, we acquired PowderPure for approximately $54.2 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.

During the first quarter of 2017, we acquired Fragrance Resources for approximately $137.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.

 49

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired David Michael for approximately $237.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.

Credit Facility and Senior Notes

We supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. 

Commercial Paper

Commercial paper issued by the Company generally has terms of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The revolving credit facility is used as a backstop for the Company's commercial paper program. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2018 and 2017 was $85 million and $107.5 million, respectively.

Credit Facility and Term Loan

On May 21, 2018, June 6, 2018 and July 13, 2018, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries amended and restated the Company’s existing amended and restated credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) in connection with the acquisition of Frutarom, to, among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility until June 6, 2023, (ii) increase the maximum ratio of net debt to EBITDA on and after the closing date of the acquisition and (iii) increase the drawn down capacity to $1,000 million, consisting of a $585 million tranche A revolving credit facility (which provides for borrowings available in U.S. dollars, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and/or British pounds sterling, with a sublimit of $25 million for swing line borrowings) (“Tranche A”) and a $415 million tranche B revolving credit facility (which provides for borrowings available in U.S. dollars, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and/or British pounds sterling, with sublimits of €50 million and $25 million for swing line borrowings) (“Tranche B” and, together with Tranche A, the “Revolving Facility”). The interest rate on the Revolving Facility will be, at the applicable borrower’s option, a per annum rate equal to either (x) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.75% to 1.75% or (y) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.00% to 0.750%, in each case depending on the public debt ratings for non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt issued by the Company. Other terms and covenants under the Amended Credit Facility remain substantially unchanged. The Amended Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes of each borrower and its subsidiaries. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are unsecured and the Company has guaranteed the obligations of each other borrower under the Amended Credit Facility. The Company pays a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments; such fee is not material. 

On June 6, 2018, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement to replace a portion of the bridge loan facility, reducing the amount of the bridge loan commitments by $350 million. Under the term loan credit agreement, the lenders thereunder committed to provide, subject to certain conditions, a senior unsecured term loan facility (as amended, "Term Loan") in an original aggregate principal amount of up to $350.0 million, maturing three years after the funding date thereunder. The proceeds from the term loan were received on October 3, 2018. 

The Term Loan bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (x) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.75% to 2.00% or (y) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.00% to 1.00%, in each case depending on the public debt ratings for non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt issued by the Company. Loans under the Term Loan will amortize quarterly at a per annum rate of 10.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans made under the Term Loan on the funding date, commencing December 31, 2018, with the balance payable on October 3, 2021. The Company may voluntarily prepay the term loans without premium or penalty. 

The Amended Credit Facility and Term Loan contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12-month period, including the pro forma effect of the acquisition of Frutarom, of not more than 4.5 to 1.0, which shall be reduced to 4.25 to 1.0 as of the end of September 30, 2019, 4.0 to 1.0 as of the end of March 31, 2020 and to 3.5 to 1.0 as of the end of March 31, 2021. 

As of December 31, 2018 we had no of borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility but $350 million outstanding for the Term Loan. The amount which we are able to draw down on under the Amended Credit Facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. As of December 31, 2018, our draw down capacity was $1 billion on the Amended Credit Facility and $350 million on the Term Loan. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the credit facility and loan.

 50

At December 31, 2018 and 2017 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. At December 31, 2018 our Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA(1) ratio was 3.56 to 1 as defined by the credit facility agreements, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and/or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

(1)Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, which are non-GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows:

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Senior Notes - 2007.

Financing of the Acquisition of Frutarom

Bridge Loan Facility

In connection with entering into the merger agreement with Frutarom in May 2018, the Company entered into a debt commitment letter for up to a $5.45 billion 364-day unsecured bridge loan facility to the extent the Company had not received $5.45 billion of net cash proceeds (and/or qualified bank commitments) from a combination of (a) the issuance by the Company of a combination of equity securities, equity-linked securities and/or unsecured debt securities and/or (b) unsecured term loans, in each case, at or prior to completion of the acquisition. On May 21, 2018, the Company, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and certain other financial institutions entered into a bridge joinder agreement to the commitment letter to provide for additional bridge commitment parties. As a result of the Company's entering into the debt and equity financing as discussed above, the bridge loan facility was terminated on September 26, 2018. In connection with the bridge loan commitment, the Company incurred $39.4 million of fees which are included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income in the year ended December 31, 2018.

Senior Unsecured Notes

On September 25, 2018 the Company issued €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that mature on September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Euro Notes”). The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.5% per year, payable annually on September 25 of each year, beginning September 25, 2019. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were €297.7 million ($349.5 million in USD).

On September 25, 2018, the Company issued €800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that mature on September 25, 2026 (the “2026 Euro Notes”). The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.8% per year, payable annually on September 25 of each year, beginning September 25, 2019. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were €794.1 million ($932.2 million in USD).

On September 26, 2018, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that mature on September 25, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.4% per year, payable semi-annually on March 25 and September 25 of each year, beginning March 25, 2019. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $298.9 million.

On September 26, 2018, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that mature on September 26, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.45% per year, payable semi-annually on March 26 and September 26 of each year, beginning March 26, 2019.

 52

Tangible Equity Units - Senior Unsecured Amortizing Notes

On September 17, 2018, in connection with the issuance of the TEUs, the Company issued $139.5 million aggregate principal amount of Amortizing Notes. The Amortizing Notes mature on September 15, 2021. Each quarterly cash installment payment of $0.75 (or, in the case of the installment payment due on December 15, 2018, $0.73333) per Amortizing Note will constitute a partial repayment of principal and a payment of interest, computed at an annual rate of 3.79%. Interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30 day months. Payments will be applied first to the interest due and payable and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount, allocated as set forth in the amortization schedule in the indenture governing the Amortizing Notes. See Note 9 for further information on the TEUs.

There are no covenants or provisions in the indenture related to the TEUs that would afford the holders of the amortizing notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving the Company that may adversely affect such holders. If a fundamental change occurs, or if the Company elects to settle the SPCs early, then the holders of the Amortizing Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Amortizing Notes at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Amortizing Notes as of the repurchase date plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture also contains customary events of default which would permit the holders of the Amortizing Notes to declare the notes to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods, including the failure to make timely installment payments on the notes or other material indebtedness, failure to give notice of a fundamental change and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.

Other Commitments

Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2018 and 2017, we spent $6.2 million and $27.9 million on capital projects and $21.7 million and $17.5 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

At December 31, 2018, we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________ 

(1)See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities.

(2)Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business, including sale leaseback obligations included in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(4)Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans.

 53

(5)Purchase commitments include agreements for raw material procurement and contractual capital expenditures. Amounts for purchase commitments represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.

(6)This amount represents the cash portion of the “toll charge” that is payable in installments over eight years beginning in 2018. This amount represents the seven remaining installments.

The table above does not include $48.9 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $3 million of associated accrued interest, and $88.8 million associated with the deferred tax liability on deemed repatriation. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.

Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:

Business Combinations. From time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers. When we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we apply the acquisition method described in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. In accordance with GAAP, the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward.

We allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period the amounts are determined.

Significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically engage third-party valuation specialists, who work under the direction of management, to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired.

The fair value estimates are based on available historical information, future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.

We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates, discount rate and profitability), royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method, customer attrition rates, product obsolescence factors, a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment. All of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., trademarks, product formulas, non-compete agreements and customer relationships) are expected to have finite useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold.

The costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives. The value of residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note. For acquired intangible assets, the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks, product formulas, and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned. 

The periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill. We currently have goodwill of $5.4 billion, of which $4.2 billion relates to our acquisition of Frutarom and is subject to change upon completion of our allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Frutarom. The allocation of goodwill among reporting units has not yet been completed but will be completed within one year from the Frutarom acquisition date, October 4, 2018. 

 54

In assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market-based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350. The Company has identified five reporting units: (1) Flavor Compounds, (2) Fragrance Compounds, (3) Fragrance Ingredients, (4) Cosmetic Actives Ingredients and (5) Frutarom. These reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed by segment management. In the case of Frutarom, the reporting unit determination is preliminary and is subject to change.

The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment test for its reporting units by assessing the fair value of the reporting units based on discounted cash flows. If a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the Company will record an impairment charge based on that difference, and the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2018, which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units, except for the recently acquired Frutarom reporting unit for which the fair value is expected to approximate the carrying value.

The periodic assessment of potential impairment of finite-lived intangible assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. An estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques, including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.

The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. We account for taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard. This evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. We do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments, even if ultimately resolved against us, would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that significantly revised the U.S. tax code effective January 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21%, limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation, transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations. 

The Tax Act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter. In particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system required us to record a one-time tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of $100.6 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on non-U.S. subsidiaries. The cash portion of the "toll charge" is payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of $38.6 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. 

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an additional charge of $0.6 million to adjust an accrual related to withholding taxes on planned repatriations. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first installment of the “toll charge”. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a benefit of $8.0 million to adjust the provisional “toll charge” required from the transition to the new territorial tax system, and a benefit of $0.2 million to adjust the remeasurement 

 55

of net deferred tax assets as a result of U.S. tax reform. During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded an additional charge of $32.8 million to adjust an accrual related to the U.S. state impact and foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriations, and completed its assessment under SAB 118 with no further material change to the amounts previously recorded.

The Tax Act created significant international tax provisions, including a new category of income, global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). The Company has elected to treat GILTI as a current period cost if and when incurred. This tax position resulted in an $8.2 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. We are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental-related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated.

We regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. To the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. Management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.

We regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties (“PRP’s”) associated with our exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRP’s to share such costs.

Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.

We consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. We derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. We base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes.

We consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at December 31. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated Aa or higher by either Moody’s or Standard & Poor's with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. For the Non-U.S. Plans, the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate bonds. Consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate. The rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience.

With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The target asset allocation consists of approximately: 20% in equity securities and 80% in fixed income securities. The plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 4.9% over the previous 20 years. At December 31, 2018, the actual asset allocation for the U.S. plan was: 1% cash and cash equivalents, 25% in equity securities and 74% in fixed income securities.

The expected rate of return for the non-U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. The target asset allocation, for the non-U.S. plans, consists of approximately: 40% – 70% in fixed income securities; 15% – 40% in equity securities; 5% – 20% in real estate; and 5% – 10% in alternative investments. At December 31, 2018, the actual asset allocation for the non-U.S. plan was: 36% in fixed income investments; 12% in equity investments; 8% in real estate investments, 3% in cash and cash equivalents and 41% in alternative investments.

 56

Changes in pension and other post-employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effect of a 1% increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively; a 1% decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.

The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. We hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. As of December 31, 2018, we maintained 53% of our inventory as raw materials. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete.

Redeemable Non-controlling interest. Through some of our subsidiaries, we assume certain non-controlling interests that carry redemption features. Non-controlling interests, where we may be required to repurchase the non-controlling interest under a put option or other contractual redemption requirement, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet between liabilities and equity, as redeemable non-controlling interest. We adjust the redeemable non-controlling interests when the redemption value exceeds the carrying value with changes recognized as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. 

Overall, we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. We have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

New Accounting Standards

Please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

Revenue Recognition - Adoption of ASC 606

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", with subsequent amendments, that provides for a comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers (ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) (the “Revenue Standard”). Under the Revenue Standard, revenue is recognized to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Companies have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The new Revenue Standard became effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and we have adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective approach on December 30, 2017, the first day of our 2018 fiscal year.

We create and manufacture flavors and fragrances. Approximately 90% of our products, principally flavor compounds and fragrance compounds, are customized to customer specifications and have no alternative use other than the sale to the specific customer (“Compounds products”). The remaining revenue is derived largely from ingredients products that, generally, are commodity products with alternative uses and not customized (“Ingredients products”).

With respect to the vast majority of our contracts for Compounds products, we currently recognize revenue on the transfer of control of the product at a point in time as we do not have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to 

 57

date” (as set out in the Revenue Standard). With respect to a small number of contracts for the sale of Compounds, we have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to date” and as the products do not have an alternative use, we recognize revenue for these contracts over time and record a contract asset using the output method. The output method recognizes revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract.

With respect to our contracts related to Ingredients products, we currently recognize revenue on the transfer of control of the product at a point in time as such products generally have alternative uses and we do not have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to date.”

As we adopted the Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective method effective the first day of its 2018 fiscal year, results for our 2018 fiscal year are presented under the Revenue Standard while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605, which required that revenue was accounted for when the earnings process was complete.

We recorded a net increase to retained earnings of $2.1 million as of the first day of its 2018 fiscal year due to the cumulative impact of adopting the Revenue Standard. In connection with the adjustment to retained earnings, we also recorded an increase of $4.4 million in contract assets (which are included in Prepaid expenses and other assets), a decrease of $1.7 million in inventory, and an increase in taxes payable of $0.6 million.

 The impact to revenues, gross profit and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were reductions of $4.0 million, $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, as a result of applying the Revenue Standard as compared to the amounts that would have been recognized under ASC Topic 605.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect are excluded from revenues. We receive payment in accordance with standard customer terms.

The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by product categories:

The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by region, based on the region of our customers:

 58

Flavor and Fragrance Compounds Revenues

We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties and payment terms (which vary by customer) are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. Consistent with our past practice, the amount of revenue recognized is adjusted at the time of sale for expected discounts and rebates (“Variable Consideration”).

We generate revenues primarily by manufacturing customized taste and scent compounds for the exclusive use of our customers. We combine the shipment of goods with their manufacture to account for both shipment and manufacture as the sole performance obligation.

With respect to the vast majority of our contracts for Compounds products, we recognize a sale at the point in time when it ships the product from its manufacturing facility to its customer, as this is the time when control of the goods has transferred to the customer. The amount of consideration received and revenue recognized is impacted by the Variable Consideration the Company has agreed with its customers. We estimate Variable Consideration amounts for each customer based on the specific agreement, an analysis of historical volumes and the current activity with that customer. We reassess our estimates of Variable Consideration at each reporting date throughout the contract period and updates the estimate until the uncertainty is resolved. During the current period, changes to estimates of Variable Consideration have been immaterial.

With respect to a small number of contracts for the sale of Compounds products, we recognize revenue over time as it manufactures customized compounds that do not have an alternative use and for which the contracts provide us with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, at all times during the contract term commencing with the manufacturing of the goods. When revenue is recognized over time, the amount of revenue recognized is based on the extent of progress towards completion of the promised goods. We generally use the output method to measure progress for its contracts as this method reflects the transfer of goods to the customer. Once customization begins, the manufacturing process is generally completed within a two week period. Due to the short time frame for production, there is little estimation uncertainty in the process. In addition, due to the customized nature of our products, our returns are not material.

Ingredients Revenues

We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties and payment terms (which vary by customer) are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable.

We generate revenues primarily by manufacturing Ingredients products for the use of our customers. We combine the shipment of goods with their manufacture to account for both shipment and manufacture as the sole performance obligation.

Generally, we recognize a sale at the time when it ships the product from their manufacturing facility to their customer, as this is the point when control of the goods or services has transferred to the customer. The amount of consideration received and revenue recognized is impacted by discounts offered to its customers. We estimate discounts based on an analysis of historical experience and current activity. We assess our estimates of discounts at each reporting date throughout the contract period and updates its estimates until the uncertainty has been resolved. During the current period, changes to estimates of discounts have been immaterial.

 59

Contract Asset and Accounts Receivable

The following table reflects the balances in our contract assets and accounts receivable for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use non-GAAP financial operating measures in this Form 10-K, including: (i) currency neutral sales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in U.S. dollars), (ii) adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin (which exclude operational improvement initiatives, acquisition related costs, integration related costs, FDA mandated product recall and Frutarom acquisition related costs), (iii) adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin (which excludes operational improvement initiatives, acquisition related costs, integration related costs, legal charges/credits, net, tax assessment, restructuring and other charges, net, gain on sale of assets, FDA mandated product recall, UK pension settlement charges and Frutarom acquisition related costs), and (iv) adjusted selling and administrative expenses (which excludes acquisition related costs, integration related costs, legal charges/credits, net, tax assessment, UK pension settlement charges and Frutarom acquisition related costs) and (v) adjusted effective tax rate (which excludes operational improvement initiatives, acquisition related costs, integration related costs, legal charges/credits, net, tax assessment, restructuring and other charges, net, CTA realization, FDA mandated product recall, UK pension settlement charges, U.S. tax reform and Frutarom acquisition related costs). We also provide the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA (which excludes certain specified items and non-cash items as set forth in the Company’s debt agreements) and net debt (which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents) solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the Company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements.

In addition, the Frutarom acquisition related costs have been separated from costs related to prior acquisitions. The Frutarom acquisition costs represent a significant balance and we believe this amount should be shown separately to provide an accurate presentation of the acquisition related costs. Our GAAP results and GAAP metrics do not change and this change has no effect on day to day business operations, or how we manage our business.

We have included each of these non-GAAP measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe such additional non-GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. In addition, management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. A material limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics, including GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

Statements in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts or information, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on management’s current assumptions, estimates and expectations and include statements concerning (i) our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Frutarom acquisition, including our ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities and offer our customers innovative and differentiated products and our ability to achieve the cost-savings synergies; (ii) our ability to achieve long-term sustainable growth and increase shareholder value, (ii) the growth potential of the markets in which we operate, including the emerging markets, (iii) our expectations regarding our Ingredients business, (iv) our expectations regarding percentage of revenues that will be attributed to research and development in 2019; (v) expected developments in the regulatory regime in which we operate; (vi) our expectations regarding future price volatility of raw materials; (vi) our expectations regarding the impact of litigation; (vii) expected capital expenditures and cost pressures in 2019, (viii) expectations regarding our 2017 productivity program; (ix) our ability to innovate and execute on specific consumer trends and demands, and (x) our ability to reduce our net debt levels over the next three years. These forward-looking statements should be evaluated with consideration given to the many risks and uncertainties inherent in our business that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Certain of such forward-looking information may be identified by such terms as “expect”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “outlook”, “may”, “estimate”, “should”, “predict” and similar terms or variations thereof. Such forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company, are not guarantees of future results or performance, and involve significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, including assumptions and projections, for all forward periods. Our actual results may differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following:

•risks related to the integration of the Frutarom business, including whether we will realize the benefits anticipated from the acquisition in the expected time frame; 

•unanticipated costs, liabilities, charges or expenses resulting from the Frutarom acquisition;

•the increase in our leverage resulting from the additional debt incurred to pay a portion of the consideration for Frutarom and its impact on our liquidity and ability to return capital to its shareholders;

•our ability to successfully market to its expanded and decentralized Taste and Frutarom customer base;

•our ability to effectively compete in its market and develop and introduce new products that meet customers’ needs;

 63
