ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Our operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.

Executive Overview

We have a multi-year goal to grow our business and increase operating margins for our brands by focusing on these key business priorities:

•Grow our business in North America;

•Extend our brands internationally; and

•Focus on the fundamentals of our business. 

We also continue to focus on:

•Attracting and retaining top talent;

•Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and

•Returning value to our shareholders.

 20
The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:

Grow our business in North America

Our number one priority is improving performance at Victoria's Secret by staying close to our customer, improving our assortment and improving the customer experience in stores and online. We have new leaders at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, and we are looking at every aspect of our business: our marketing, brand positioning, internal talent, real estate portfolio, direct business and cost structure. We are focused on improving our merchandise assortment. We believe we have significant opportunities to improve our merchandise, making sure we have a robust product pipeline, fashion that our customers really want with high emotional content. We will also be expanding our assortment to include new and previously exited categories, but doing some things differently through new licensing opportunities in eyewear and swimwear.

The core of Bath & Body Works is its body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In 2019, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America by about 3% through the opening of approximately 25 net new Bath & Body Works stores and the remodeling of existing stores.

Our Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works direct businesses, with $2.5 billion in sales and operating margins in excess of 20%, are growing rapidly at a mid-to-high-teens rate. Our investment in technology and logistics will increase substantially in 2019 for initiatives supporting our direct businesses.

Extend our brands internationally

We believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have separate, dedicated teams that have taken a methodical, "test and learn" approach to expansion. We expand our presence outside of North America by opening company-owned stores, as well as by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners.

•Victoria’s Secret International Stores — We have made significant progress in expanding Victoria's Secret internationally. During 2018, we opened eight new Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores in Greater China, bringing the total to 15. In 2019, we have plans to open three to five new Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores in Greater China.

Further, our partners opened 15 Victoria's Secret full-assortment and four PINK stores in 2018, bringing the totals to 47 Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores and nine PINK stores. There were notable openings in Australia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia and Thailand. Our partners plan to open approximately 20 Victoria's Secret full-assortment stores and one or two PINK stores in 2019.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Focus on the fundamentals of our business

We are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity. In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.

2018 Overview

Our performance continues to be mixed. Growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by a decline at Victoria’s Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International. Our net sales increased $605 million to $13.237 billion driven by a comparable sales increase of 3%. Our operating income decreased $491 million to $1.237 billion, and our operating income rate decreased to 9.3% from 13.7%. 

 21
•Victoria’s Secret has underperformed - major merchandise misses have resulted in increased promotion which negatively impacted margin rates. Victoria’s Secret segment comparable sales declined 2% for the year, and operating income declined 50%. By business unit:

◦In Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, 2018 comparable sales declined in the low-single digit range. We are seeing some improved performance in our newer bra launches. However, growth in new styles has not been enough to offset the decline in older styles. We made a substantial investment in sleepwear for the Holiday season, and the category delivered strong growth over last year.

◦PINK comparable sales declined in the mid-single digit range in 2018, as fashion misses in apparel drove a decline in performance. 

◦Victoria’s Secret Beauty, with improved fashion, delivered low-double digit comparable sales growth in 2018. 

•Bath & Body Works has an experienced team with strong merchandising skills. They have a close connection to the customer and a fast and agile supply chain, resulting in another record year, on top of a record 2017. In 2018, Bath & Body Works comparable sales increased 11%, and operating income increased 13%. Sales in the direct channel increased 30%. We ended the year with more than 600 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores are driving significant sales growth and, importantly, present a new, compelling store experience for customers. 

•Revenue in our Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment increased by 20% in 2018, and operating income declined, as improved performance in our franchise businesses was offset by underperformance in the U.K. and our investment in China. 

Our recent overall performance at Victoria's Secret has been below our expectations, and we are determined to do better. By executing our strategy, focusing on the fundamentals, staying close to our customers and leveraging the strength of our brands, we are focused on meeting or exceeding the expectations of our stakeholders - customers, associates and shareholders. 

At the end of the year, we made significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth. These actions include:

◦Closing Henri Bendel;

◦Selling the La Senza business; and

◦Reducing our regular dividend to reduce debt levels.

We believe these decisions will strengthen our company.

For additional information related to our 2018 financial performance, see “Results of Operations – 2018 Compared to 2017.”

We are committed to returning value to our shareholders. During 2018, we paid $666 million in dividends and repurchased $196 million of our common stock. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately $21 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

 22
Adjusted Financial Information

In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in 2018, 2017 and 2016 on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.

2019 Outlook

The global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully, and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals.

At the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 ________________

(a)The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 

(b)Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Victoria’s Secret

For 2018, net sales decreased $12 million to $7.375 billion; comparable sales decreased 2%; and comparable store sales decreased 6%. PINK comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily driven by merchandise performance in apparel and the exit of swim. Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales decreased in the low-single digit range, primarily driven by declines in unconstructed and sport bras, due to merchandise performance and category resets, partially offset by increases in sleep and panties. Victoria's Secret Beauty comparable sales increased low-double digits, driven by the merchandise assortment. Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement. 

The decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic.

 28
Bath & Body Works

For 2018, net sales increased $483 million to $4.631 billion; comparable sales increased 11%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.

The increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion.

For 2018, net sales increased $103 million to $605 million due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. 

Other

Gross Profit

For 2018, our gross profit decreased $60 million to $4.899 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 37.0% from 39.3% primarily as a result of:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory, $70 million of store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S. and Canada and increased distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the store asset impairment charges.

Bath & Body Works

For 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.

The gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For 2018, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by $31 million of store asset impairment charges related to certain Victoria's Secret stores in the U.K. and higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater China, partially offset by increased merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by the store asset impairment charges and investments in store real estate.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

For 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $332 million to $3.563 billion driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments, higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath & Body Works and new company-owned stores in Greater China.

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 26.9% from 25.6% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments.

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza

In 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of $99 million, primarily related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments, as well as the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

Interest Expense

The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2018 and 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other Income (Loss)

For 2018, our other income (loss) increased $15 million to $5 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in 2017, partially offset by fewer distributions received from our Easton investments and the negative impacts of foreign exchange.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2018, our effective tax rate decreased to 24.9% from 25.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.

For 2017, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $109 million to $3.231 billion primarily driven by an increase in marketing expenses due to increased direct mail at Victoria's Secret, higher selling expenses at Bath & Body Works and in Greater China due to the increase in net sales, and as a result of our investment in Greater China. These increases were partially offset by lower selling expenses related to lower sales volumes at Victoria's Secret and severance charges recorded in the first quarter of 2016 related to the Victoria's Secret restructuring.

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 25.6% from 24.8% primarily due to increased marketing expenses.

Other Income and Expenses

Interest Expense

The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for 2017 and 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2017, our interest expense increased $12 million to $406 million due to a higher average borrowing rate and the impact of the extra week in 2017.

Other Income (Loss)

For 2017, our other income (loss) decreased $97 million to a $10 million loss. Activity in 2016 included a distribution received from Easton Town Center, LLC resulting in a pre-tax gain of $108 million, partially offset by a $36 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2017 Notes. In 2017, we recognized a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes, partially offset by gains related to distributions from certain of our Easton investments.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2017, our effective tax rate decreased to 25.1% from 31.7%. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. The 2016 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters. 

Results of Operations—Fourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2016

We utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for the fourth quarter of 2017 represent the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, and the results for the fourth quarter of 2016 represent the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. The extra week accounted for approximately $160 million in incremental net sales and an estimated $46 million in incremental operating income in 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table compares fourth quarter of 2017 comparable sales to fourth quarter of 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 ________________

(a)The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was 

 37
calculated on a 14-to-14-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2016 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis. 

(b)Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.

The results by segment are as follows:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased $80 million to $2.669 billion; comparable sales decreased 1%; and comparable store sales decreased 6%. Net sales increased in PINK, beauty and sport apparel driven by merchandise assortment that incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. These results were partially offset by a decrease in lingerie sales driven by a decline in unconstructed and sport bra performance.

The decrease in comparable store sales was driven primarily by lower traffic and lower average unit retail.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased $174 million to $1.794 billion; comparable sales increased 6%; and comparable store sales increased 4%. Net sales increased in the home fragrance and body care categories, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.

The increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average unit retail.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased $46 million to $170 million, primarily related to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores and direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.

Gross Profit

For the fourth quarter of 2017, our gross profit increased $96 million to $2.040 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 42.3% from 43.3% primarily as a result of:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by an increase in distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate primarily due to increased promotional activity.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate and distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate primarily due to increased promotional activity, partially offset by leverage of buying and occupancy expenses on higher sales.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross profit increase was driven by increased merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater China and at Victoria's Secret U.K.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by an increase in occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater China and at Victoria's Secret U.K.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2017, our effective tax rate decreased to 21.1% from 29.2%. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. The 2016 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held by domestic subsidiaries as of February 2, 2019. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $413 million as of February 2, 2019. 

We are committed to returning value to our shareholders. During 2018, we paid $666 million in dividends and repurchased $196 million of our common stock. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. 

 39
The following table provides our outstanding debt balance, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, as of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Exchange of Notes

In June 2018, we completed private offers to exchange $62 million, $220 million and $44 million of outstanding 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively, for $297 million of newly issued 6.694% notes due in January 2027 and $52 million in cash consideration, which included a $24 million exchange premium. The exchange was treated as a modification under ASC 470, Debt, and no gain or loss was recognized. The exchange premium will be amortized through the maturity date of January 2027 and is included within Long-term Debt on the February 2, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”).

Issuance of Notes

In January 2018, we issued $500 million of 5.25% notes due in February 2028. The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors. The proceeds from the issuance were $495 million, which were net of issuance costs of $5 million. These issuance costs are being amortized through the maturity date of February 2028 and are included within Long-term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Redemption of Notes

In January 2018, we used the proceeds from the 2028 Notes to redeem the $500 million 2019 Notes for $540 million. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of this debt of $45 million (after-tax loss of $29 million), which includes write-offs of unamortized issuance costs and discounts and losses related to terminated interest rate swaps associated with the 2019 Notes. This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2017 Consolidated Statement of Income.

Secured Revolving Facility

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility ("Secured Revolving Facility"). The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of $1 billion and expires in May 2022. The Secured Revolving Facility allows us and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.

The Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are 0.25% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 1.50% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is the 

 40
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.50% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus 1.50% per annum.

The Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00 for the most recent four-quarter period. In addition, the Secured Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than 3.00 to 1.00 and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of February 2, 2019, we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than 3.00 to 1.00.

During 2018, we borrowed, and made payments of, $92 million under the Secured Revolving Facility. As of February 2, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Facility.

The Secured Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $9 million of outstanding letters of credit as of February 2, 2019 that reduced our remaining availability under the Secured Revolving Facility.

Secured Foreign Facilities

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure revolving and term loan bank facilities ("Secured Foreign Facilities") used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations. The Secured Foreign Facilities, which allow borrowings in U.S. dollars and Chinese Yuan, have availability totaling $100 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. During 2018, we borrowed $107 million and made payments of $17 million under the Secured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2018 was $99 million. Borrowings on the Secured Foreign Facilities mature between February 2019 and May 2022. As of February 2, 2019, borrowings of $12 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings are included within Long-term Debt.

Unsecured Foreign Facilities

We guarantee unsecured revolving and term loan bank facilities ("Unsecured Foreign Facilities") used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations. The Unsecured Foreign Facilities, which allow borrowings in U.S. dollars and Chinese Yuan, have availability totaling $100 million. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing. During 2018, we borrowed $65 million and made payments of $92 million under the Unsecured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in 2018 was $90 million. Borrowings on the Unsecured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2019 and December 2019. As of February 2, 2019, borrowings of $60 million are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Working Capital and Capitalization

We believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors’ collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.

The following table provides our credit ratings as of February 2, 2019:

(c)Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In connection with the sale of La Senza, we have remaining guarantees of $76 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to 

 45
the disposition of the business. We recognized an initial liability of $5 million representing the estimated fair value of our obligation as guarantor in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees. 

In connection with the disposition of a certain other business, we have remaining guarantees of $6 million related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2021. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. In certain instances, our guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. We have not recorded a liability with respect to these guarantee obligations as of February 2, 2019 or February 3, 2018 as we concluded that payments under these guarantees were not probable.

In connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is $94 million. We recorded a liability of $11 million and $3 million related to these guarantee obligations as of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, respectively, which are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which was further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016. This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the standard, income from the Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, which was historically presented as a reduction to General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, is presented as revenue. Further, historical accounting related to loyalty points earned under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program changed as we now defer revenue associated with customer loyalty points until the points are redeemed using a relative stand-alone selling price method. The standard also changed accounting for sales returns which requires balance sheet presentation on a gross basis.

In the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment resulting in a reduction to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $28 million. The cumulative adjustment primarily related to the deferral of revenue related to outstanding points, net of estimated forfeitures, under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program. In addition, Net Sales and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses both increased $187 million in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income. Further, gross presentation of our sales return reserve resulted in a $5 million increase in Other Current Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other on the February 2, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities, which addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities in net income as compared to historical treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 and recorded an increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of $2 million.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, Leases, which is effective beginning in fiscal 2019 and requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting. The standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases. In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a transition option that would not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption. 

 46
We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019 and apply the standard prospectively as of the adoption date. As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but have elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to our leases at transition.

Substantially all of our leases, including our retail store locations, are subject to operating lease accounting under the new standard. We expect to recognize right-of-use assets of approximately $3.3 billion and related lease liabilities of approximately $3.7 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption at the beginning of fiscal 2019. These balances will change as our lease portfolio changes due to execution of lease modifications or new leases. The right-of-use assets are based upon the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred rent liabilities and unamortized landlord construction allowances. We will continue to recognize rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge will be the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Impact of Inflation

While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.

We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.

We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $5 million for 2018. A 10% increase

or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $5 million for 2018.

Valuation of Long-lived Assets

Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill, through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Our reporting units that have goodwill are Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and Greater China. 

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset, and compare that value with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.

We estimate the fair value of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.

Claims and Contingencies

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. 

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.

We follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach. 

We recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.

We offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.

We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Revenue earned in connection with Victoria’s Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income.

We also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.
