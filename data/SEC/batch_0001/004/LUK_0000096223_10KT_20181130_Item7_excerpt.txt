Results of Operations

We are a diversified financial services company engaged in investment banking and capital markets, asset management and direct investing. Jefferies Group, our largest subsidiary, is the largest independent full-service global investment banking firm headquartered in the U.S. 

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we changed our fiscal year end from a calendar year basis to a fiscal year ending on November 30. Our 2018 fiscal year consists of the eleven month transition period beginning January 1, 2018 through November 30, 2018. Financial statements for 2017 and 2016 continue to be presented on the basis of our previous calendar year end. Jefferies Group has a November 30 year end. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, because our fiscal year end was December 31, we reflected Jefferies Group in our consolidated financial statements utilizing a one month lag. In connection with our change in fiscal year end to November 30, we eliminated the one month lag utilized to reflect Jefferies Group results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2018. Therefore, our results for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, include twelve month results for Jefferies Group and eleven months for the remainder of our results.

23

During the second and third quarters of 2018, we closed three previously announced transactions that impacted our results for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018. These include the sale of 48% of National Beef in June 2018, reducing our ownership to 31%. We deconsolidated National Beef and are accounting for our remaining investment as an equity method investment within our Merchant Banking business. In August 2018, we sold 100% of our equity interest in Garcadia and our associated real estate. Vitesse Energy Finance also acquired a package of non-operated Bakken assets for $190.0 million in April 2018, of which approximately $144.0 million was funded as equity.

Our pre-tax income from continuing and discontinued operations was $1.3 billion for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, significantly higher than $1.0 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $296.1 million for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 as compared to $606.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

Results for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 include a pre-tax gain of $873.5 million, or $643.9 million net of tax expense, from the National Beef transaction. This gain is reflected in our results as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Our share of the results of National Beef prior to the transaction have also been reflected as discontinued operations, including prior year amounts. Results for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 include the pre-tax gain of $221.7 million from the Garcadia transaction. The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include a pre-tax gain on the sale of Conwed Plastics ("Conwed") of $178.2 million. 

A number of other items also impacted comparability of 2018 with the prior year. Results for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 includes a mark-to-market decrease in the value of our investment in Spectrum Brands of $418.8 million, a mark-to-market increase in the value of our investment in WeWork of $70.9 million, a $62.1 million impairment loss related to our investment in FXCM, a $47.9 million impairment loss related to Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC ("Golden Queen"), a net loss at LAM and continued strong performance by Berkadia. The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 includes a $130.2 million impairment loss related to FXCM and a mark-to-market increase in the value of our investment in HRG Group, Inc. ("HRG") of $64.8 million.

Jefferies Group

Jefferies Group was acquired on March 1, 2013 and is reflected in our 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements utilizing a one month lag; Jefferies Group's fiscal year ends on November 30th. Jefferies Group financial data is presented in each year based on the twelve months ended November 30. A summary of results of operations for Jefferies Group is as follows (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Jefferies Group comprises many business units, with many interactions and much integration among them. Business activities include the sales, trading, origination and advisory effort for various equity, fixed income, commodities, foreign exchange and advisory services. Jefferies Group's business, by its nature, does not produce predictable or necessarily recurring revenues or earnings. Jefferies Group's results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic conditions generally, and its own activities and positions.

Revenues by Source

Net revenues presented for Jefferies Group's businesses include allocations of interest income and interest expense as it assesses the profitability of these businesses inclusive of the net interest revenue or expense associated with the respective activities, which is a function of the mix of each business's associated assets and liabilities and the related funding costs.

In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018, Jefferies Group has made changes to the presentation of its "Revenues by Source" to better align the manner in which we describe and present the results of Jefferies Group's performance with the manner in which it manages its business activities and serves its clients. We believe that the reorganization of Jefferies Group's revenue reporting will enable us to describe the business mix more clearly and provide greater transparency in the communication of Jefferies Group's results. Additionally, the results of the investment banking business now include a new subcategory "Other investment banking", which contains Jefferies Group's share of net earnings from its corporate lending joint venture, Jefferies Finance, as well as any gains and losses from any securities or loans received or acquired in connection with its investment banking efforts. Previously reported results are presented on a comparable basis in the tables below.

The following is a description of the changes that have been made:

•Equities revenues now represent the activities of Jefferies Group's core equities sales and trading, securities finance, prime brokerage and wealth management businesses. Revenues from other activities previously presented within the Equities business have been disaggregated as follows:

◦Jefferies Group's share of net earnings from its Jefferies Finance joint venture, as well as any revenues from securities and loans received or acquired in connection with its investment banking efforts, are now presented as part of Jefferies Group's investment banking business.

◦Jefferies Group's share of net earnings from its historic Jefferies LoanCore LLC ("Jefferies LoanCore") joint venture is presented as part of its fixed income business through its sale in October 2017.

◦Revenues related to Jefferies Group's principal investments in certain private equity funds and hedge funds managed by third parties or related parties, investments in strategic ventures (including KCG Holdings, Inc. ("KCG") through its sale in July 2017), certain other securities owned, and investments held as part of obligations under employee benefit plans, including deferred compensation arrangements, are now presented as part of its other business.

◦Revenue related to Jefferies Group's capital invested in asset management funds that are managed by Jefferies Group is now presented within Jefferies Group's asset management business.

•Revenues from Jefferies Group's legacy futures business and revenues associated with structured notes issued by Jefferies Group are now presented as part of its other business. Additionally, revenues derived from securities or loans received or 

26

acquired in connection with Jefferies Group's investment banking efforts are now presented as part of investment banking revenues.

•Revenues from principal investments in certain private equity and asset management funds managed by related parties, which were previously presented within Jefferies Group's asset management revenue, are now presented as part of its other business.

The changes to the manner in which we describe and disclose the performance of Jefferies Group's business activities has no effect on its historical consolidated results of operation. The composition of Jefferies Group's net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of its operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary from period to period due to fluctuations in economic and market conditions, and its own performance. 

The following provides a summary of net revenues by source (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Equities Net Revenues

Equities are comprised of net revenues from:

•services provided to Jefferies Group's clients from which it earns commissions or spread revenue by executing, settling and clearing transactions for clients;

•advisory services offered to clients;

•financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services offered to clients; and

•wealth management services, which includes providing clients access to all of its institutional execution capabilities.

Total equities net revenues were $665.6 million for 2018, a decrease of $8.8 million, compared with $674.4 million for 2017. Equities posted record results in 2018 for Jefferies Group's overall global core sales and trading business and within the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Jefferies Group's results include records for its electronic trading, equity derivatives and prime brokerage businesses. The increase in equities net revenues from its core equities sales and trading businesses was offset by losses in certain block positions in 2018 compared with gains in 2017. 

The results in equities net revenues during 2018 reflect improved performance in various core global equities businesses, primarily driven by higher revenues in Jefferies Group's equity derivatives, electronic trading and prime brokerage businesses, primarily due to higher equity volatility, overall improved market trading volumes and an increase in its commissions. This was partially offset by a decrease in its U.S. and European cash equities, convertibles and securities finance businesses, primarily due to lower customer activity. European revenues were also lower as a result of the delay in advisory payments and the impact of unbundling due to the Market in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID II") regulation.

Equities net revenues were $674.4 million for 2017, an increase of $77.0 million compared with $597.4 million for 2016. Equities net revenues increased with higher revenues in Jefferies Group's electronic trading, prime brokerage services, and Asia Pacific cash equities businesses, primarily due to increased customer activity and increased trading volumes. The increase was partially offset by lower revenues in its equity derivatives and Europe cash equities businesses, primarily due to reduced market making activities 

27

and lower equity volatility. In addition, results in 2017 included certain strategic investment gains compared with losses in 2016. Equities commission revenues declined in Jefferies Group's equity derivative and U.S. cash equities businesses due to reduced trading volumes and lower levels of volatility, partially offset by higher revenues in its electronic trading and Asia Pacific cash equities businesses due to increased trading volumes.

Fixed Income Net Revenues

Fixed income is comprised of net revenues from: 

•executing transactions for clients and making markets in securitized products, investment grade, high-yield, emerging markets, municipal and sovereign securities and bank loans;

•foreign exchange execution on behalf of clients; and

•interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives (used primarily for hedging activities).

Fixed income net revenues in 2017 and 2016 also included Jefferies Group's share of the net earnings from its joint venture investment in Jefferies LoanCore, which was accounted for under the equity method. On October 31, 2017, Jefferies Group sold all of its membership interests in Jefferies LoanCore for approximately $173.1 million, the estimated book value at October 31, 2017. In addition, Jefferies Group may be entitled to additional cash consideration over the next four years in the event Jefferies LoanCore's yearly return on equity exceeds certain thresholds.

Fixed income net revenues totaled $559.7 million for 2018, a decrease of $58.7 million compared with net revenues of $618.4 million in 2017, primarily due to difficult market conditions in Jefferies Group's global investment grade credit businesses predominately in the fourth quarter of 2018. Further, performance in the first quarter of 2017 was bolstered by robust trading activity following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, which was not repeated in the current year. 

Revenues in Jefferies Group's U.S. securitized markets group were significantly improved, primarily as its business continues to focus on the securitization of non-commoditized products. Revenues in Jefferies Group's leveraged credit business were strong as Jefferies Group enhanced its trading and coverage team across loans, bonds and distressed products, as well as increased results from secondary trading of floating rate loans, while balancing market risk. Revenues declined in Jefferies Group's global investment grade credit business as lack of volatility and higher interest rates reduced trading volumes resulting in increased competition chasing limited opportunities. During the fourth quarter, credit spreads widened and new issue activity slowed, further reducing client trading activity. Revenues in Jefferies Group's international securitized markets group were down due to limited market opportunities as the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program comes to an end.

Global rates revenues in 2018 declined due to uncertainty over Brexit and international economic concerns. In addition, the opportunities in the prior year, primarily in the first quarter of 2017, from volatility from the U.S. Presidential election and European election cycles were not replicated in the current year. Revenues in Jefferies Group's municipal trading business were lower on reduced market activity driven by changes in federal tax legislation and the backdrop of increased interest rates dampened investor interest. The business outperformed in the prior year, as macro events drove a more favorable trading environment. The prior year also included revenues from Jefferies Group's share of Jefferies LoanCore, which was sold in October 2017, as well as revenues from non-core fixed income products that have now been de-emphasized.

Fixed income net revenues were $618.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $35.9 million, compared with net revenues of $654.3 million in 2016. Jefferies Group recorded modestly lower revenues in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to a more challenging trading environment across most products, including most credit and rates businesses. In 2017, volatility was dampened as quantitative easing continued across most markets Jefferies Group transacts in. This was partially offset by better risk management, addition of staff in certain businesses, and refreshed strategies in some businesses. 

Net revenues in Jefferies Group's leveraged credit business in 2017 were higher due to increased trading activities in high yield and distressed products as a result of additions to staff and repositioned risk. This was compared to relatively significant mark-to-market losses recognized in the early part of 2016. Higher revenues in Jefferies Group's European credit and international securitized markets group businesses were due to repositioned strategies taking advantage of trading opportunities in certain industry sectors. This is compared to volatile oil prices and uncertainty as to bank liquidity in 2016, which negatively impacted revenues in this business in the prior year. Jefferies Group's municipal securities business performed well for the greater part of the year, driven by increased client activity as new team members were added and market share expanded. Performance for the municipal securities business was partially dampened at the end of the 2017 fiscal year as the municipal bond market dislocated over concerns around the potential impacts of pending U.S. tax reform on both municipal bond issuers and investors.

Revenues in Jefferies Group's corporates and emerging markets business declined in a maturing credit cycle as volatility and transaction spreads decreased from prior year levels, while demand for new issuances and higher yielding investments and higher levels of volatility were prevalent in 2016. Lower revenues in Jefferies Group's global rates and U.S. securitized markets group business were due to lower levels of volatility resulting in lower transaction based revenues. In the U.S. securitized markets businesses 

28

this was partially offset by increased activity in origination businesses including collateralized loan obligations. Net revenues from Jefferies Group's share of Jefferies LoanCore, which was sold in October 2017, increased slightly during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to an increase in loan closings and syndications.

Investment Banking Revenues

Investment banking is comprised of revenues from:

•capital markets services, which include underwriting and placement services related to corporate debt, municipal bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and equity and equity-linked securities and loan syndication;

•advisory services with respect to mergers and acquisitions and restructurings and recapitalizations;

•Jefferies Group's share of net earnings from its corporate lending joint venture Jefferies Finance; and

•securities and loans received or acquired in connection with Jefferies Group's investment banking activities.

Total investment banking revenues were $1,913.8 million for 2018, including an increase of $131.8 million in investment banking net revenues as a result of the new revenue standard. See Notes 2 and 4, in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details on the new revenue standard. Jefferies Group's results reflect continued strong performance in both its equity capital markets and advisory businesses, as Jefferies Group increased its fee market share in both businesses.

Other investment banking revenues were $3.6 million for 2018 compared with $19.8 million for 2017. The results reflect net revenues of $98.6 million and $90.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, from Jefferies Group's share of the profits of the Jefferies Finance joint venture, which were offset by the amortization of costs and allocated interest expense related to Jefferies Group's investment in the Jefferies Finance business.

From equity and debt capital raising activities, Jefferies Group generated $454.6 million and $635.6 million in revenues, respectively, for 2018. During 2018, Jefferies Group completed 969 public and private debt financings that raised $270.1 billion in aggregate and Jefferies Group completed 193 public and private equity and convertible offerings that raised $43.3 billion (179 of which Jefferies Group acted as sole or joint bookrunner). Financial advisory revenues totaled $820.0 million, including revenues from 180 merger and acquisition transactions and 15 restructuring and recapitalization transactions with an aggregate transaction value of $193.9 billion.

Total investment banking revenues were a then record $1,784.1 million for 2017, 64.4% higher than 2016. This increase was due to strong performance across Jefferies Group's debt capital markets, equity capital markets and advisory businesses, supported by a strong overall capital raising and merger and acquisition environment. In 2016, new issue equity and leveraged finance capital markets were virtually closed throughout January and February and remained slow throughout 2016. Capital markets revenues in 2017 increased 84.2% from 2016. Advisory revenues for 2017 increased 17.7% compared to 2016. Other investment banking revenues were $19.8 million for 2017, compared with a loss of $108.5 million for 2016. The results reflect net revenues of $90.8 million and a net loss of $9.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, from Jefferies Group's share of the profits of the Jefferies Finance joint venture, which were offset by the amortization of costs and allocated interest expense related to Jefferies Group's investment in the Jefferies Finance business.

From equity and debt capital raising activities during 2017, Jefferies Group generated $345.0 million and $649.2 million in revenues, respectively. During 2017, Jefferies Group completed 1,121 public and private debt financings that raised $292.1 billion in aggregate and Jefferies Group completed 173 public and private equity and convertible offerings that raised $59.7 billion (164 of which Jefferies Group acted as sole or joint bookrunner). Financial advisory revenues totaled $770.1 million, including revenues from 171 merger and acquisition transactions and ten restructuring and recapitalization transactions with an aggregate transaction value of $180.6 billion.

Investment banking revenues were $1,085.5 million for 2016. From equity and debt capital raising activities during 2016, Jefferies Group generated $235.2 million and $304.6 million in revenues, respectively. During 2016, Jefferies Group completed 892 public and private debt financings that raised $188.6 billion in aggregate and Jefferies Group completed 129 public and private equity and convertible offerings that raised $24.4 billion (125 of which Jefferies Group acted as sole or joint bookrunner). Financial advisory revenues totaled $654.2 million, including revenues from 161 merger and acquisition transactions and 18 restructuring and recapitalization transactions with an aggregate transaction value of $135.2 billion.

29

Other Net Revenues

Other net revenues are comprised of revenues from:

• strategic investments other than Jefferies Finance (such as KCG through its sale in July 2017);

• principal investments in private equity and hedge funds managed by third parties or related parties;

• investments held as part of employee benefit plans, including deferred compensation plans (for which Jefferies Group incurs corresponding compensation expenses); and

• Jefferies Group's legacy Futures business.

Other also includes Jefferies Group's share of the income from Berkadia for the months of October and November 2018. On October 1, 2018, Jefferies transferred to Jefferies Group its 50% interest in Berkadia.

Other net revenues totaled $45.3 million for 2018, a decrease of $47.7 million compared with $93.0 million for 2017. Results for 2017 included a net gain of $93.4 million from Jefferies Group's investment in KCG, which was sold in July 2017, partially offset by foreign currency gains. The results in 2018 include net revenues of $20.0 million due to Jefferies Group's share of income from Berkadia.

Other net revenues totaled $93.0 million for 2017, an increase of $92.0 million compared with $1.0 million for 2016. Results for 2017 included a net gain of $93.4 million from Jefferies Group's investment in KCG, which was sold in July 2017, compared with a net gain of $19.6 million for 2016.

Asset Management Net Revenues

Asset management revenues include the following:

• management and performance fees from funds and accounts managed by Jefferies Group; and

• investment income from capital invested in and managed by Jefferies Group's asset management business and other asset managers.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Jefferies transferred to Jefferies Group capital investments in certain separately managed accounts and funds. Due to this transfer, Jefferies Group has made changes to the presentation of its "Revenues by Source" in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are including investment income from capital invested in these separately managed accounts and funds within asset management revenues. Previously reported results are presented on a comparable basis. 

Asset management revenues were $(1.1) million for 2018, as compared with $28.2 million for 2017 and $76.3 million for 2016. The decline in asset management revenues from 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018 is primarily due to reduced returns on investments. The key components of asset management revenues are the level of assets under management and the performance return, whether on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark or hurdle. These components can be affected by financial markets, profits and losses in the applicable investment portfolios and client capital activity. Further, asset management fees vary with the nature of investment management services. The terms under which clients may terminate Jefferies Group's investment management authority, and the requisite notice period for such termination, varies depending on the nature of the investment vehicle and the liquidity of the portfolio assets.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expense consists of salaries, benefits, commissions, annual cash compensation awards and the amortization of certain share-based and cash compensation awards to employees. Cash and historical share-based awards and a portion of cash awards granted to employees as part of year end compensation generally contain provisions such that employees who terminate their employment or are terminated without cause may continue to vest in their awards, so long as those awards are not forfeited as a result of other forfeiture provisions (primarily non-compete clauses) of those awards. Accordingly, the compensation expense for a portion of awards granted at year end as part of annual compensation is recorded in the year of the award.

Included in Compensation and benefits expense are share-based amortization and cash-based expense for senior executive awards, non-annual share-based and cash-based awards to other employees and certain year end awards that contain future service requirements for vesting, all of which are being amortized over their respective future service periods. In addition, the senior executive awards contain market and performance conditions.

Compensation expense related to the amortization of share-based and cash-based awards amounted to $302.0 million, $278.2 million and $287.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of Net revenues was 54.5%, 57.2% and 65.0% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

30

Non-Compensation Expenses

Non-compensation expenses include floor brokerage and clearing fees, underwriting costs, technology and communications expense, occupancy and equipment rental expense, business development, professional services, bad debt provision, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization expense and other costs. All of these expenses, other than floor brokerage and clearing fees and depreciation and amortization expense, are included in Selling, general and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The increase in non-compensation expenses during 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to a $131.8 million increase mostly in business development expenses and underwriting costs, as a result of applying the new revenue standard to results of operations for 2018. The increase during 2018 was also due to an increase in technology and communication expenses due to higher costs associated with the development of the various trading systems and Jefferies Group's efforts to provide its professionals with modern digital tools to help them better serve its clients. The increase also includes higher professional service expenses due to an increase in legal and consulting fees.

In 2017, non-compensation expenses increased 5.9% compared to 2016. The increase in non-compensation expenses during 2017 was consistent with the increased activity associated with higher net revenues, as well as increased spending on technology. At the same time, non-compensation expenses as a percentage of Net revenues declined from 33.8% to 27.0% again demonstrating strategically the operating leverage inherent in Jefferies Group's business. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily due to an increase in Floor brokerage and clearing expenses due to the mix of costs across certain equities and fixed income businesses, technology and communications expenses due to costs associated with the development of the various trading systems and projects associated with corporate support and core business infrastructures, and an increase in certain other expenses.

Merchant Banking

A summary of results for Merchant Banking is as follows (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Merchant Banking includes the consolidated results of Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy (oil and gas production and development), Conwed and Idaho Timber (manufacturing companies), LAM (asset management) and Foursight Capital (vehicle finance). It also includes our ownership of Spectrum Brands/HRG shares, which is accounted for at fair value and impacts our results through its mark-to-market adjustments reflected in Net revenues, our investment in WeWork and the results of our investment in FXCM. Interest and gains related to the note receivable component of our FXCM investment are included in Net revenues, while income (loss) related to our equity method investment in FXCM is included in Income (loss) related to associated companies. Additionally, Merchant Banking includes our equity investments in National Beef (beef processing), Berkadia, prior to its transfer to Jefferies Group on October 1, 2018 (commercial mortgage banking, investment sales and servicing), HomeFed (real estate company), Garcadia, prior to its sale in August 2018 (automobile dealerships), Linkem (fixed wireless broadband services in Italy) and Golden Queen (a gold and silver mining project).

31

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we amalgamated all our primary financial services operating businesses into one platform by transferring our 50% membership interest in Berkadia and our LAM seed investments into Jefferies Group. Revenues related to the net assets transferred were $6.7 million, $49.6 million and $26.5 million for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income from continuing operations before income taxes related to the net assets transferred were $47.7 million, $118.4 million and $109.4 million for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

The following provides a summary of net revenues by source (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Oil and gas revenues for 2018 increased due to Vitesse Energy Finance's acquisition of additional non-operated Bakken assets in the second quarter of 2018 as well as an increase in oil prices in 2018 compared to 2017. Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy net revenues also include net unrealized gains (losses) of $29.1 million, $1.8 million and $(11.8) million related to derivatives during the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As discussed further in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, Vitesse Energy Finance uses swaps and call and put options in order to reduce exposure to future oil price fluctuations. JETX Energy revenues during the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were impacted by $12.1 million, $(20.1) million and $9.6 million, respectively, of unrealized gains (losses) on a trading asset which is held at fair value. 

Net revenues for manufacturing for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include the gain on the sale of Conwed of $178.2 million. In January 2017, we sold 100% of Conwed to Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc., (NYSE: SWM) for $295 million in cash plus potential earn-out payments in 2019, 2020 and 2021 totaling up to $40 million in cash to the extent the results of Conwed's subsidiary, Filtrexx International, exceed certain performance thresholds. Excluding the gain on the sale of Conwed, net revenues for manufacturing increased in 2018 as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in sales at Idaho Timber. Net manufacturing revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased due to the gain on the sale of Conwed, partially offset by the absence of Conwed revenues through the majority of 2017.

The decrease in LAM net revenues in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily reflects lower principal transactions revenue due to two strategies negatively impacted by exceptional volatility during the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase in 2017 LAM net revenues as compared to 2016 primarily reflects better returns on investments.

As more fully discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, on September 1, 2016, we amended the terms of our loan and associated rights related to FXCM. Among other changes, the amendments gave Jefferies a 50% voting interest in FXCM and we gained the ability to significantly influence FXCM through our seats on the board. As a result of the amendment, we have accounted for our equity interest in FXCM under the equity method of accounting since September 1, 2016. Net revenues include gains of $18.6 million and $23.2 million during the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, from our FXCM term loan and a loss of $(54.6) million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from our FXCM term loan and related rights. This includes the component related to interest income, which is recorded within Principal transactions revenues. 

Spectrum Brands/HRG net revenues reflect changes in the value of our investment. We classify Spectrum Brands/HRG as a trading asset for which the fair value option was elected and we reflect mark-to-market adjustments through Principal transactions revenue.

Other revenues for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 reflect the gain on sale of our equity interests in Garcadia and our associated real estate of $221.7 million. Other net revenues for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, also include a $70.9 million, $6.1 million and $65.6 million increase in the fair value of WeWork. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include a $19.7 million realized security gain from an investment in a non-public security.

The following provides a summary of total expenses by source (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total expenses for Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy in 2018 increased compared to 2017, primarily due to Vitesse Energy Finance's acquisition of additional non-operated Bakken assets in the second quarter of 2018. Selling, general and other expenses in 2016 include impairment charges of $63.8 million recorded by JETX Energy. The impairment charge primarily related to decisions made by JETX Energy in the third quarter of 2016 to curtail development of both its southern acreage in the East Eagle Ford and its Houston County acreage. A $55.0 million impairment charge was recorded for the difference between the carrying value of that acreage and the estimated net realizable value. The 2016 impairment also included the write-down of certain JETX Energy leases that would not benefit its business going forward. 

The increase in total expenses for manufacturing in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily relates to an increase in cost of sales associated with an increase in sales at Idaho Timber. The decrease in manufacturing expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to the sale of Conwed in the first quarter of 2017.

Total expenses for LAM were impacted by the growth of our business in 2018 and 2017 as compared to the prior years. 

Other expenses for 2017 reflect the write-down of a note receivable of $20.0 million related to the prior sale of a subsidiary. The decrease in other expenses in 2018 also reflects the deconsolidation of a real estate investment in 2017.

The following provides a summary of Income (loss) related to associated companies (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

33

Income (loss) related to associated companies primarily includes our investments in National Beef, subsequent to June 5, 2018 and the Garcadia Companies, prior to their sale in August 2018. Income (loss) related to associated companies during the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 includes a $47.9 million impairment loss related to our equity investment in Golden Queen in the third quarter of 2018. As discussed further in Note 11, Golden Queen completed an updated mine plan and financial projections in the third quarter of 2018 reflecting lower grades of gold as well as a decrease in the market price of gold. As a result of lower projected cash flows, the estimated fair value of our equity interest in Golden Queen was lower than our carrying value by $47.9 million and an impairment of $47.9 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2018.

Income (loss) related to associated companies during the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, includes a $62.1 million and $130.2 million impairment loss related to our equity investment in FXCM. As discussed further in Note 11, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we updated expectations for FXCM based on recent revised regulations of the European Securities Market Authority and dampened operating results. Based on the decline in projections and the adverse effects of the European regulations, we evaluated in the fourth quarter whether our equity method investment was fully recoverable. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value of our equity interest in FXCM was lower than our carrying value by $62.1 million and an impairment of $62.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In the first quarter of 2017, Global Brokerage Holdings and FXCM's U.S. subsidiary, Forex Capital Markets LLC ("FXCM U.S.") settled complaints filed by the NFA and CFTC against FXCM U.S. and certain of its principals relating to matters that occurred between 2010 and 2014. As part of the settlements, FXCM U.S. withdrew from business and sold FXCM U.S.'s customer accounts. FXCM also implemented a restructuring plan that included the termination of approximately 22% of its global workforce. Based on the above actions, we evaluated in the first quarter of 2017 whether our equity method investment was fully recoverable. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow and comparable public company analysis. The result of our analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our equity interest in FXCM was lower than our carrying value by $130.2 million and an impairment of $130.2 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2017.

 A summary of results for Merchant Banking by source is as follows (in thousands):

Corporate 

A summary of results of operations for Corporate is as follows (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues primarily include realized and unrealized securities gains and interest income for investments held at the holding company. For the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Compensation and benefits expense includes share-based compensation expense of $21.4 million, $20.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively. 

Parent Company Interest

Parent company interest totaled $54.1 million, $58.9 million and $58.9 million for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act is one of the most comprehensive changes in the U.S. corporate income tax since 1986 and certain provisions are complex in their application. We recorded a discrete tax expense of $450.5 million as a provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This provisional estimate primarily consisted of a $415.0 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $35.5 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. During the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, we adjusted the provisional estimate by approximately $8.3 million, bringing the total amount to date to $458.8 million. This consists of a $420.7 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $38.1 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Additionally, income tax expense for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 has been impacted by certain tax planning actions taken with respect to our non-U.S. subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act. The provisional accounting charge may change until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which was issued by the SEC on December 22, 2017. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on the Tax Act and SAB 118.

For the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $19.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 6.4%. Our 2018 provision was reduced by a $48.1 million benefit resulting from a reversal of our valuation allowance with respect to certain federal and state NOLs, which we believe are more likely than not to be utilized before they expire. This benefit reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 16.2%.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $642.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of about 106%. Our 2017 provision was impacted by a non-cash $450.5 million charge related to the impact of tax reform. This charge increased our effective rate by 74%. 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $25.8 million, on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $12.6 million. Our 2016 provision was increased by a $24.9 million charge related to previously issued stock awards.

35

Discontinued Operations

On June 5, 2018, we sold 48% of National Beef to Marfrig for $907.7 million in cash, reducing our ownership in National Beef to 31%. We account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting. The sale of National Beef meets the accounting criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation as the sale represents a strategic shift in our operations and financial results. As such, we classified the results of National Beef prior to June 5, 2018 as a discontinued operation and it is reported in Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, we recognized a pre-tax gain as a result of the transaction of $873.5 million ($643.9 million after-tax) for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, which has been recognized as Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

A summary of results of discontinued operations for National Beef is as follows (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The operations of National Beef from January 1, 2018 through June 4, 2018, are included in discontinued operations for our eleven months ended November 30, 2018.

National Beef's profitability is dependent, in large part, on the spread between its cost for live cattle, the primary raw material for its business, and the value received from selling boxed beef and other products, coupled with its overall volume. National Beef operates in a large and liquid commodity market and it does not have much influence over the price it pays for cattle or the selling price it receives for the products it produces. National Beef's profitability typically fluctuates seasonally, with relatively higher margins in the spring and summer months and during times of ample cattle availability. National Beef's fiscal year consisted of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the last Saturday in December. National Beef's fiscal year 2017 consisted of 52 weeks and its fiscal year 2016 consisted of 53 weeks.

Throughout 2018, demand for beef and cattle supply remained strong, supporting favorable margin conditions. 

Revenues in 2017 increased 5% in comparison to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of cattle processed. Cost of sales increased by 4% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase is also due to an increase in the number of cattle processed. The combined effects of increased margin per head and an increase in volume led to higher profitability in 2017 as compared to 2016.

Lower average debt balances in 2017 led to a 49% decline in interest expense in 2017 as compared to 2016. 

For further information, see Note 28 to our consolidated financial statements.

Selected Statement of Financial Condition Data 

In addition to preparing our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we also review the tangible capital associated with each of our businesses and investments, which is a non-GAAP presentation and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP presentations used by other companies. We believe that this information is useful to investors as it allows them to view our businesses and investments through the eyes of management while facilitating a comparison across historical periods. We define tangible capital as Total Jefferies Financial Group Inc. shareholders' equity less Intangible assets, net and goodwill. As a result of the transactions and our current operating strategy, we have made changes to reflect the way we currently manage our business, and have reclassified the December 31, 2017 balances to conform to current year presentation. 

The tables below reconcile tangible capital to our GAAP balance sheet (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Long-term debt within Merchant Banking of $81.2 million at November 30, 2018, primarily includes $77.8 million for Vitesse Energy Finance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Corporate Liquidity

At the corporate level our assets principally consist of the stock or membership interests of our businesses and investments, cash and cash equivalents and other noncontrolling investments in debt and equity securities. Our principal sources of funds are distributions from subsidiaries, proceeds from divestitures of existing businesses and investments, repayment of subsidiary advances, available cash resources, liquid investments, funds distributed from subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, public and private capital market transactions, and management and other fees. Our cash requirements consist primarily of the payment of interest on our debt, dividends and corporate cash overhead expenses, as well as acquisitions on new businesses when determined to be in the best interest of our shareholders.

During the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, we received $713.8 million of distributions from our existing subsidiary businesses, including $441.7 million from Jefferies Group. We also received $1,584.9 million from divestitures and repayments of advances, primarily from the sales of 48% of National Beef and 100% of our equity interests in Garcadia and our associated real estate. Proceeds from the sale of 48% of National Beef and total distributions received from National Beef for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 were $1,207.7 million.

Our cash resources and investments that are easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time total $1,631.0 million at November 30, 2018, and are primarily comprised of cash, short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, and other publicly traded debt and equity securities. These are classified on our Statement of Financial Condition as cash and cash equivalents, trading assets and available for sale securities. 

Our short-term recurring cash requirements, including the payment of interest on our debt, dividends and corporate cash overhead expenses, approximate $289 million on an annual basis. Dividends paid during the eleven months ended November 30, 2018 of 

39

$151.8 million include quarterly dividends of $0.10 per share for each of the first two quarters and $0.125 per share for each of the last two quarters. The payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon general business conditions, legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. Our recurring cash requirements typically do not include significant amounts for tax payments, as we have NOLs and other tax attributes which offset federal tax liabilities. During the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, we used about $1.3 billion of our NOLs to offset taxable income, and we have about $1.1 billion remaining NOLs as of November 30, 2018.

Our primary long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on the parent company's long-term debt ($1.0 billion principal outstanding as of November 30, 2018), of which $750.0 million is due in 2023 and $250.0 million in 2043. We continue to use our available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, additional contributions to existing businesses and repurchases of our outstanding common shares. The timing of these events is influenced by many factors and therefore cannot be predicted.

In April 2018, Vitesse Energy Finance acquired non-operated Bakken assets from a portfolio company of a private equity fund for $190.0 million in cash, of which approximately $144.0 million was funded as equity by Jefferies and the balance funded by Vitesse Energy Finance's credit line. The assets purchased include interests in mineral rights and leasehold acreage in oil and gas drilling spacing units expected to be developed and working interests in cash flowing producing wells.

In May 2018, we expanded our asset management efforts by forming a strategic relationship with Weiss and invested $250.0 million in Weiss' strategy. We own a profit share in the firm for the first year and a revenue share thereafter.

In June 2018, we completed the sale of 48% of National Beef to Marfrig for approximately $907.7 million in cash, reducing our ownership in National Beef to 31%. 

In August 2018, we sold 100% of our equity interests in Garcadia and our associated real estate to our former partners, the Garff family for $417.2 million in cash.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we transferred our LAM seed investments, as well as our interest in Berkadia, to Jefferies Group. These transfers were accomplished as a capital contribution to Jefferies Group of approximately $598.2 million and an internal transfer of cash from Jefferies Group of $76.0 million to Jefferies.

In April 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase to our existing share repurchase program, bringing total common shares authorized for repurchase to 25,000,000. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved another increase to our share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of an additional 25,000,000 common shares. During the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, we purchased a total of 50,000,000 of our common shares for $1,143.0 million at an average price per share of $22.86 under these authorizations. As of November 30, 2018, no common shares remained authorized for repurchase. In January 2019, the Board of Directors approved an additional $500.0 million share repurchase authorization.

At November 30, 2018, we had outstanding 307,515,472 common shares and 20,657,000 share-based awards that do not require the holder to pay any exercise price (potentially an aggregate of 328,172,472 outstanding common shares if all awards become outstanding common shares). The 20,657,000 share-based awards include the target number of shares under the senior executive award plan, which is more fully discussed in Note 17. 

In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of our outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.

Concentration, Liquidity and Leverage Targets

From time to time in the past, we have accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings. The funds raised have been used by us for general corporate purposes, including for our existing businesses and new investment opportunities. In addition, the ratings of Jefferies are a factor considered by rating agencies that rate the debt of our subsidiary companies, including Jefferies Group, whose access to external financing is important to its day to day operations. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies, subject to change at any time, are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We target specific concentration, leverage and liquidity principles, expressed in the form of certain ratios and percentages, although there is no legal requirement to do so.

Concentration Target: As a diversification measure, we limit cash investments such that our single largest investment does not exceed 20% of equity excluding Jefferies Group, and that our next largest investment does not exceed 10% of equity excluding Jefferies Group, in each case measured at the time the investment was made. On this basis, Spectrum Brands is our largest investment excluding Jefferies Group and Vitesse Energy Finance is our next largest investment excluding Jefferies Group. National Beef is no longer considered our largest investment because we have received back cash in excess of our cumulative investments. There were no investments made during the year that approached 10% of equity excluding Jefferies Group.

Liquidity Target: We hold a liquidity reserve calculated as a minimum of twenty-four months of holding company expenses (excluding non-cash components), parent company interest, and dividends. Maturities of parent company debt within the upcoming year are also included in the target; however, our next maturity is during 2023 so there is no current inclusion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Leverage Target: We target a maximum parent debt to stressed equity ratio of .50, with stressed equity defined as equity (excluding Jefferies Group) assuming the loss of our two largest investments.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

As discussed above, we have historically relied on our available liquidity to meet short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, our operating businesses do not generally require significant funds to support their operating activities. The mix of our operating businesses and investments can change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in any one period. Further, the timing and amounts of distributions from investments in associated companies may be outside our control. As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.

Amounts related to our U.S. pension obligations ($52.3 million) are not included in the above table as the timing of payments is uncertain; however, we do expect to make $7.5 million of contributions to these plans in 2019. For further information, see Note 19 in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain. Such amounts aggregated $251.4 million at November 30, 2018; for more information, see Note 21 in our consolidated financial statements.

Our U.S. pension obligations relate to frozen defined benefit pension plans, principally the defined benefit plan of WilTel Communications Group, LLC ("WilTel"), our former telecommunications subsidiary. When we sold WilTel in 2005, its defined benefit pension plan was not transferred in connection with the sale. At November 30, 2018, we had recorded a liability of $45.8 million in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition for WilTel's unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligation. This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to former employees of WilTel (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts. Since the benefits in this plan have been frozen, future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, changes in the market value of plan assets, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.

43

Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate for the WilTel plan that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in the discount rate would affect pension expense in 2019 by $0.3 million and the benefit obligation by $5.1 million, of which $3.8 million relates to the WilTel plan.

The deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations ($49.7 million at November 30, 2018). These deferred amounts primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates. They are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year. The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into pension expense in 2019 is $1.9 million.

The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the plans, which are more fully discussed in Note 19 in our consolidated financial statements.

Jefferies Group Liquidity

General

The Chief Financial Officer and Global Treasurer of Jefferies Group are responsible for developing and implementing liquidity, funding and capital management strategies for Jefferies Group's businesses. These policies are determined by the nature and needs of day to day business operations, business opportunities, regulatory obligations and liquidity requirements.

The actual levels of capital, total assets, and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors, including asset composition, business initiatives and opportunities, regulatory requirements and cost and availability of both long-term and short-term funding. Jefferies Group has historically maintained a balance sheet consisting of a large portion of total assets in cash and liquid marketable securities, arising principally from traditional securities brokerage and trading activity. The liquid nature of these assets provides flexibility in financing and managing Jefferies Group's business.

Jefferies Group maintains modest leverage to support its investment grade ratings. The growth of its balance sheet is supported by its equity and Jefferies Group has quantitative metrics in place to monitor leverage and double leverage. Jefferies Group capital plan is robust, in order to sustain its operating model through stressed conditions. Jefferies Group maintains adequate financial resources to support business activities in both normal and stressed market conditions, including a buffer in excess of regulatory, or other internal or external, requirements. Jefferies Group's access to funding and liquidity is stable and efficient to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations in normal and stressed market conditions.

A business unit level balance sheet and cash capital analysis is prepared and reviewed with senior management on a weekly basis. As a part of this balance sheet review process, capital is allocated to all assets and gross balance sheet limits are adjusted, as necessary. This process ensures that the allocation of capital and costs of capital are incorporated into business decisions. The goals of this process are to protect Jefferies Group's platform, enable the businesses to remain competitive, maintain the ability to manage capital proactively and hold businesses accountable for both balance sheet and capital usage.

Jefferies Group actively monitors and evaluates its financial condition and the composition of its assets and liabilities. The overall securities inventory is continually monitored by Jefferies Group, including the inventory turnover rate, which confirms the liquidity of overall assets. Substantially all of Jefferies Group's financial instruments are valued on a daily basis and Jefferies Group monitors and employs balance sheet limits for its various businesses.

At November 30, 2018, our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition includes Jefferies Group's Level 3 trading assets that are approximately 2% of total trading assets.

Securities financing assets and liabilities include financing for financial instruments trading activity, matched book transactions and mortgage finance transactions. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions. 

44

The following table presents Jefferies Group's period end balance, average balance and maximum balance at any month end within the periods presented for Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fluctuations in the balance of Jefferies Group's repurchase agreements from period to period and intraperiod are dependent on business activity in those periods. Additionally, the fluctuations in the balances of Jefferies Group's securities purchased under agreements to resell are influenced in any given period by its clients' balances and its clients' desires to execute collateralized financing arrangements via the repurchase market or via other financing products. Average balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and Jefferies Group considers the fluctuations intraperiod to be typical for the repurchase market.

Liquidity Management

The key objectives of Jefferies Group's liquidity management framework are to support the successful execution of its business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. The liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that adequate financing may not be accessible to service financial obligations without material franchise or business impact.

The principal elements of Jefferies Group's liquidity management framework are the Contingency Funding Plan, the Cash Capital Policy and the assessment of Maximum Liquidity Outflow.

Contingency Funding Plan. Jefferies Group's Contingency Funding Plan is based on a model of a potential liquidity contraction over a one year time period. This incorporates potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following: 

•Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance;

•Maturity rolloff of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral;

•Higher margin requirements than currently exist on assets on securities financing activity, including repurchase agreements;

•Liquidity outflows related to possible credit downgrade;

•Lower availability of secured funding;

•Client cash withdrawals; 

•The anticipated funding of outstanding investment and loan commitments; and 

•Certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs.

Cash Capital Policy. A cash capital model is maintained that measures long-term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include equity and the noncurrent portion of long-term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following:

•Illiquid assets such as equipment, goodwill, net intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and certain investments;

•A portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment (i.e., margin requirements); and 

•Drawdowns of unfunded commitments. 

45

To ensure that Jefferies Group does not need to liquidate inventory in the event of a funding crisis, Jefferies Group seeks to maintain surplus cash capital, which is reflected in the leverage ratios Jefferies Group maintains. Jefferies Group's total long-term capital of $11.8 billion at November 30, 2018 exceeded its cash capital requirements.

Maximum Liquidity Outflow. Jefferies Group's businesses are diverse, and liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of Jefferies Group's policy to ensure it has sufficient funds to cover estimates of what may be needed in a liquidity crisis, Jefferies Group holds more cash and unencumbered securities and has greater long-term debt balances than the businesses would otherwise require. As part of this estimation process, Jefferies Group calculates a Maximum Liquidity Outflow that could be experienced in a liquidity crisis. Maximum Liquidity Outflow is based on a scenario that includes both a market-wide stress and firm-specific stress.

Based on the sources and uses of liquidity calculated under the Maximum Liquidity Outflow scenarios, Jefferies Group determines, based on its calculated surplus or deficit, additional long-term funding that may be needed versus funding through the repurchase financing market and considers any adjustments that may be necessary to Jefferies Group's inventory balances and cash holdings. At November 30, 2018, Jefferies Group had sufficient excess liquidity to meet all contingent cash outflows detailed in the Maximum Liquidity Outflow. Jefferies Group regularly refines its model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and the firm's business mix.

Sources of Liquidity

Within Jefferies Group, the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents or are deemed by Jefferies Group's management to be generally readily convertible into cash, marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Average balances are calculated based on weekly balances.

(2)Consists of high quality sovereign government securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities and other high quality sovereign government securities; deposits with a central bank within the European Economic Area, Canada, Australia, Japan, Switzerland or the U.S.; and securities issued by a designated multilateral development bank and reverse repurchase agreements with underlying collateral comprised of these securities.

(3)Other includes unencumbered inventory representing an estimate of the amount of additional secured financing that could be reasonably expected to be obtained from financial instruments owned that are currently not pledged after considering reasonable financing haircuts. 

In addition to the cash balances and liquidity pool presented above, the majority of trading assets and liabilities are actively traded and readily marketable. At November 30, 2018, repurchase financing can be readily obtained for approximately 74.4% of Jefferies Group's inventory at haircuts of 10% or less, which reflects the liquidity of the inventory. In addition, as a matter of Jefferies 

46

Group's policy, all of these assets have internal capital assessed, which is in addition to the funding haircuts provided in the securities finance markets. Additionally, certain of Jefferies Group's trading assets primarily consisting of bank loans, consumer loans and investments are predominantly funded by Jefferies Group's long-term capital. Under Jefferies Group's cash capital policy, capital allocation levels are modeled that are more stringent than the haircuts used in the market for secured funding; and surplus capital is maintained at these more stringent levels. Jefferies Group continually assesses the liquidity of its inventory based on the level at which Jefferies Group could obtain financing in the market place for a given asset. Assets are considered to be liquid if financing can be obtained in the repurchase market or the securities lending market at collateral haircut levels of 10% or less. 

The following summarizes Jefferies Group's trading assets by asset class that are considered to be of a liquid nature and the amount of such assets that have not been pledged as collateral as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Consists solely of agency mortgage-backed securities issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae. These securities include pass-through securities, securities backed by adjustable rate mortgages, collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and interest- and principal-only securities.

(2)Unencumbered liquid balances represent assets that can be sold or used as collateral for a loan, but have not been.

In addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels, it is estimated that each of the individual securities within each asset class above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions, assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated. There are no restrictions on the unencumbered liquid securities, nor have they been pledged as collateral.

Sources of Funding

Secured Financing

Readily available secured funding is used to finance Jefferies Group's inventory of financial instruments. Jefferies Group's ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of the ability to obtain short and intermediate-term secured funding, primarily through securities financing transactions. Repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements (collectively "repos"), respectively, are used to finance a portion of long inventory and cover a portion of short inventory through pledging and borrowing securities. Approximately 69.5% of Jefferies Group's cash and noncash repurchase financing activities use collateral that is considered eligible collateral by central clearing corporations. Central clearing corporations are situated between participating members who borrow cash and lend securities (or vice versa); accordingly, repo participants contract with the central clearing corporation and not one another individually. Therefore, counterparty credit risk is borne by the central clearing corporation which mitigates the risk through initial margin demands and variation margin calls from repo participants. The comparatively large proportion of Jefferies Group's total repo activity that is eligible for central clearing reflects the high quality and liquid composition of its trading inventory. For those asset classes not eligible for central clearing house financing, Jefferies Group seeks to execute its bi-lateral financings on an extended term basis and the tenor of Jefferies Group's repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements generally exceeds the expected holding period of the assets Jefferies Group is financing. The weighted average maturity of cash and noncash repurchase agreements for non-clearing corporation eligible funded inventory is approximately three months at November 30, 2018.

47

Jefferies Group's ability to finance its inventory via central clearinghouses and bi-lateral arrangements is augmented by Jefferies Group's ability to draw bank loans on an uncommitted basis under its various banking arrangements. At November 30, 2018, short-term borrowings, which must be repaid within one year or less and include bank loans and overdrafts, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and structured notes totaled $387.5 million. Interest under the bank lines is generally at a spread over the federal funds rate. Letters of credit are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in favor of exchanges in lieu of depositing cash or securities. Average daily short-term borrowings outstanding for Jefferies Group were $472.6 million and $482.4 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Jefferies Group's short-term borrowings include an Intraday Credit Facility, whereby the Bank of New York Mellon has agreed to make revolving intraday credit advances for an aggregate committed amount of $150.0 million. The Intraday Credit Facility contains financial covenants, which includes a minimum regulatory net capital requirement for its U.S. broker-dealer. Interest is based on the higher of the Federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or the prime rate. At November 30, 2018, Jefferies Group was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Intraday Credit Facility.

In addition to the above financing arrangements, Jefferies Group issues notes backed by eligible collateral under a master repurchase agreement, which provides an additional financing source for its inventory ("repurchase agreement financing program"). The notes issued under the program are presented within Other secured financings in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. At November 30, 2018, the outstanding notes were $881.5 million, bear interest at a spread over London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and mature from April 2019 to September 2019. 

Long-Term Debt

Jefferies Group's long-term debt reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at November 30, 2018 is $6.5 billion. Jefferies Group's long-term debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 8.6 years. Jefferies Group's next scheduled maturity is the $680.8 million principal amount of 8.5% Senior Notes that mature in July 2019.

Jefferies Group's long-term debt ratings are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Jefferies Group's access to external financing to finance its day to day operations, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent upon various factors, including its debt ratings. Jefferies Group's current debt ratings are dependent upon many factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trend and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share and competitive position in the markets in which it operates. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact Jefferies Group's credit ratings. While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact on its business and trading results in future periods is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors, including the magnitude of the downgrade, the behavior of individual clients and future mitigating action taken by Jefferies Group.

In connection with certain OTC derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, Jefferies Group may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. At November 30, 2018, the amount of additional collateral that could be called by counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations under the terms of such agreements in the event of a downgrade of Jefferies Group's long-term credit rating below investment grade was $55.8 million. For certain foreign clearing organization's credit rating is only one of several factors employed in determining collateral that could be called. The above represents management's best estimate for additional collateral to be called in the event of credit rating downgrade. The impact of additional collateral requirements is considered in Jefferies Group's Contingency Funding Plan and calculation of Maximum Liquidity Outflow, as described above.

Ratings issued by credit rating agencies are subject to change at any time.

Net Capital

Jefferies Group operates a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and member firms of FINRA. Jefferies LLC is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule ("Rule 15c3-1"), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and has elected to calculate minimum capital requirements using the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3-1 in calculating net capital. Jefferies LLC, as a dually-registered U.S. broker-dealer and FCM, is also subject to Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which sets forth minimum financial requirements. The minimum net capital requirement in determining excess net capital for a dually-registered U.S. broker-dealer and FCM is equal to the greater of the requirement under Rule 15c3-1 or CFTC Rule 1.17. Jefferies LLC's net capital and excess net capital at November 30, 2018 were $1,739.4 million and $1,636.0 million, respectively. FINRA is the designated examining authority for Jefferies Group's U.S. broker-dealer and the NFA is the designated self-regulatory organization for Jefferies LLC as an FCM.

Certain other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries of Jefferies Group are subject to capital adequacy requirements as prescribed by the regulatory authorities in their respective jurisdictions, including Jefferies International Limited which is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that require the registration of all swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and/or major security-based swap participants. While entities that register under these provisions will be subject to regulatory capital requirements, these regulatory capital requirements have not yet been finalized. Jefferies Group expects that these provisions will result in modifications to the regulatory capital requirements of some of its entities, and will result in some of its other entities becoming subject to regulatory capital requirements for the first time, including Jefferies Financial Services, Inc., which registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC during January 2013 and Jefferies Financial Products LLC, which registered during August 2014. The regulatory capital requirements referred to above may restrict Jefferies Group's ability to withdraw capital from its regulated subsidiaries.

On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council and triggered a two-year period to negotiate its withdrawal from the European Union on March 29, 2019 ("Brexit"), absent any extensions or changes to this time schedule. While, there is ongoing uncertainty as to the terms and any potential transition periods related to Brexit, Jefferies Group has taken steps to ensure its ability to provide services to its European clients without interruption. As such, Jefferies Group has established a wholly-owned subsidiary of its U.K. broker-dealer in Germany, which has been approved as an authorized MiFID investment firm by the German regulator, and which will enable Jefferies Group to conduct business across all of its European investment banking, fixed income and equity platforms. Jefferies Group's plans contemplate providing sufficient capital pursuant to the regulatory requirements for the planned operations as well pursuant to requirements of relevant clearing organizations.

Some of our other consolidated subsidiaries also have credit agreements which may restrict the payment of cash dividends, or the ability to make loans or advances to the parent company.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As shown below, at November 30, 2018, our commitments and guarantees, substantially all of which related to Jefferies Group, totaled $26,695.5 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Certain of Jefferies Group's derivative contracts meet the definition of a guarantee and are therefore included in the above table. For additional information on commitments, see Note 24 in our consolidated financial statements.

We have agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for up to one-half of any losses incurred under a $1.5 billion surety policy securing outstanding commercial paper issued by an affiliate of Berkadia. As of November 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. This commitment is not included in the table above as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain.

In the normal course of business Jefferies Group and certain other subsidiaries engage in other off-balance sheet arrangements, including derivative contracts. Neither derivatives' notional amounts nor underlying instrument values are reflected as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Rather, the fair values of derivative contracts are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Trading assets – Derivative contracts or Trading liabilities – Derivative contracts as applicable. Derivative contracts are reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis when a legal right of offset exists under an enforceable master netting agreement. For additional information about our accounting policies and our derivative activities see Notes 2, 5 and 6 in our consolidated financial statements.

We are routinely involved with variable interest entities ("VIEs") in the normal course of business. At November 30, 2018, we did not have any commitments to purchase assets from our VIEs. For additional information regarding VIEs, see Notes 8 and 10 in our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments – Trading assets and Trading liabilities are recorded at fair value, either as required by accounting pronouncements or through the fair value option election. Gains and losses on trading assets and trading liabilities are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in Principal transactions. Available for sale securities are reflected at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of equity, net of taxes. The cost of securities sold is 

50

based on average cost. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).

In determining fair value, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We apply a hierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs as follows:

Level 1:Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments.

Level 2:Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments includes cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, derivative instruments fair values for which have been derived using model inputs that are directly observable in the market, or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.

Level 3:Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments are measured using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.

Fair value is a market based measure; therefore, when market observable inputs are not available, our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability. The availability of observable inputs can vary for different products. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity. The valuation of financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest amount of management judgment.

Jefferies Group's Independent Price Verification Group, independent of its trading function, plays an important role in determining that financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, these control processes include reviews of the pricing model's theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. In addition, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model.

For further information on the fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, see Notes 2 and 5 in our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes – We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If in the future we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our net deferred tax asset in excess of our recorded amount, an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period. If in the future we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period. We are required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weigh the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance. Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.

Our estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about our operating businesses and investments, includes an aggregation of individual projections for each significant operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and includes all future years that we estimate we will have available NOLs. As discussed further in Note 21, Federal NOLs begin to expire in 2025. We believe that our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if our current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts, further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible. 

We also record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing 

51

positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and if so estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition or results of operations.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacts many areas of taxation, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax; (3) the introduction of the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (4) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income; (6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (8) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (9) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. income tax liability; (10) limitations on NOLs generated after December 31, 2017, to 80% of taxable income; (11) requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years; and (12) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). While the initial estimated impact of the Tax Act was calculated using all available information, we anticipate modifications based on the procedures set forth under SAB 118. This process is applied at each reporting period to account for and qualitatively disclose: (1) the effects of the change in tax law for which accounting is complete; (2) provisional amounts (or adjustments to provisional amounts) for the effects of the tax law where accounting is not complete, but that a reasonable estimate has been determined; and (3) where a reasonable estimate cannot yet be made, taxes are reflected in accordance with the law prior to the enactment of the Tax Act. Because of a November 30 year end, our measurement period will extend into the first quarter of 2019.

Due to the complex nature of the Tax Act, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act. If we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of certain elements for which our analysis is not yet complete, we recorded a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements, we have not recorded any adjustments related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the Tax Act. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to refinement of our calculations based on updated information, changes in interpretations and assumptions, and guidance that may be issued and actions we may take in response to the Tax Act. We note that the Tax Act is complex and we continue to assess the impact that various provisions will have on our business. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected, we consider the accounting for the deferred tax asset remeasurements, the transition tax, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year end data and tax positions. In connection with our initial analysis, we recorded a discrete tax expense of $450.5 million as a provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act during 2017. This provisional estimate primarily consisted of a $415.0 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $35.5 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. During the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, we revised our prior estimate and recorded a $8.3 million increase in our tax expense related to the Tax Act.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets – We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.

We recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $71.1 million in 2016. $56.3 million of the 2016 charge related to write-downs of JETX Energy's unproved oil and gas properties and $7.5 million related to the write-down of JETX Energy's assets held for sale to fair value. In the third quarter of 2016, JETX Energy curtailed development of its southern acreage in the East Eagle Ford and its Houston County acreage. As a result, an impairment was recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated net realizable value of the acreage. 

Impairment of Equity Method Investments – We evaluate equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary. We consider a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate, declines 

52

in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee. Whenever we believe conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be significantly impaired, we obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets. We use this information and, together with discussions with the investee's management, evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value, and if so and the situation is deemed other than temporary, record an impairment charge.

As described further in Note 11, in the third quarter of 2018 we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value of our equity investment in Golden Queen. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis and is categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discounted cash flow valuation model used inputs including management's projections of future Golden Queen cash flows and a discount rate of 12%. The estimated fair value of our equity investment in Golden Queen was $62.3 million, which was $47.9 million lower than our prior carrying value at the end of the second quarter 2018. As a result, an impairment charge of $47.9 million was recorded in Income (loss) related to associated companies in the third quarter of 2018.

During 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $130.2 million related to the write-down to fair value of our equity investment in FXCM. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value of our equity interest in FXCM in the first quarter of 2017. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow and comparable public company analysis. We concluded based on the regulatory actions, FXCM's restructuring plan, investor perception and declines in the trading price of Global Brokerage's common shares and convertible debt, that the decline in fair value of our equity interest was other than temporary. As such, we impaired our equity investment in FXCM. 

During 2018, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $62.1 million related to the equity component of our investment in FXCM, which is based on updated expectations that have been impacted by the recently revised regulations of the European Securities Market Authority and dampened operating results. Based on the updated projections, we evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2018 whether our equity method investment was fully recoverable. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value of FXCM. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The result of our analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our equity interest in FXCM was lower than our carrying value by $62.1 million. We concluded that based on the decline in projections and the adverse effects of the European regulations, that the decline in fair value of our equity interest was other than temporary. As a result, we impaired our equity investment in FXCM in the fourth quarter of 2018 by $62.1 million.

Goodwill – We allocate the acquisition cost of consolidated businesses to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made by management to determine these values, and may include the use of appraisals, consideration of market quotes for similar transactions, use of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information we believe to be relevant. Any excess acquisition cost over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized to expense. Substantially all of our goodwill was recognized in connection with the Jefferies Group acquisition.

At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level. In testing for goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not necessary. If we conclude otherwise, we are required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill and allocated intangible assets. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, the goodwill for the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value then a second step is performed in order to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any, which is based on comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value. 

The fair values are based on valuation techniques that we believe market participants would use, although the valuation process requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The methodologies we utilize in estimating fair value include price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of comparable public companies and/or projected cash flows. In addition, as the fair values determined under a market approach represent a noncontrolling interest, we applied a control premium to arrive at the estimated fair value of our reporting units on a controlling basis. The estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.

An independent valuation specialist was engaged to assist with the valuation process relating to Jefferies Group for our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 1, 2018. The results of this test indicated the fair value of Jefferies Group was in excess of 

53

the carrying value. However, the valuation methodology is sensitive to comparable company multiples and management's forecasts of future profitability, which comes with a level of uncertainty regarding U.S. and global economic conditions, trading volumes and equity and debt capital market transaction levels. The fair value of our reporting units, including Jefferies Group, is also impacted by our overall market capitalization. If the future were to differ adversely from these assumptions or there was a sustained decline in our market capitalization, the estimated fair value of Jefferies Group may decline and result in an impairment. 

Intangible Assets – Intangible assets deemed to have finite lives are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, where the useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly, or indirectly, to our future cash flows. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. If future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods, particularly for those with large investments in amortizable intangible assets, impairment charges would have to be recorded.

An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when certain events or circumstances exist indicating an assessment for impairment is necessary. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using valuation techniques consistent with what a market participant would use. All of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were recognized in connection with the Jefferies Group acquisition, which consists of exchange and clearing organization membership interests and registrations. Our annual impairment testing date is as of August 1, 2018. 

Contingencies – In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in legal and regulatory proceedings. We are also involved, from time to time, in other exams, investigations and similar reviews (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our businesses, certain of which may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other injunctions.

We recognize a liability for a contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, we accrue the most likely amount of such loss, and if such amount is not determinable, then we accrue the minimum in the range as the loss accrual. The determination of the outcome and loss estimates requires significant judgment on the part of management, can be highly subjective and is subject to significant change with the passage of time as more information becomes available. Estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within our power to control. We do not believe that any of our current litigation will have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts, the excess could be significant in relation to results of operations for that period. For further information, see Note 24 in our consolidated financial statements.
