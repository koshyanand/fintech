PART I  

 ITEM   1. BUSINESS  

BACKGROUND  

As used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms Moodys or the Company refer to Moodys Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Companys executive offices are located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300.  

THE COMPANY  

Moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v) learning solutions and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moodys reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. Financial information and operating results of these segments, including revenue, expenses and operating income, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this annual report, and are herein incorporated by reference.  

MIS publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. Ratings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors. MIS provides ratings in more than 130 countries. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media, including the internet and real-time information systems widely used by securities traders and investors. As of December 31, 2018, MIS had the following ratings relationships:  

 »    

Approximately 4,800 rated non-financial corporate issuers;  

 »    

Approximately 4,100 rated financial institutions issuers;  

 »    

Approximately 17,600 rated public finance issuers (including sovereign, sub-sovereign and supranational issuers);  

 »    

Approximately 9,600 rated structured finance transactions; and  

 »    

Approximately 1,000 rated infrastructure and project finance issuers.  

Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations, which primarily consist of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA non-rating operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.  

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA offers subscription based research, data and analytical products, including credit ratings produced by MIS, credit research, quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools, economic research and forecasts, business intelligence and company information products, and commercial real estate data and analytical tools. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides offshore analytical and research services along with learning solutions and certification programs. MA customers represent more than 11,100 institutions worldwide operating in over 150 countries. During 2018, Moodys research website was accessed by over 281,000 individuals including 38,000 customer users.  

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH  

Over recent decades, global fixed-income markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and types of securities or other obligations outstanding. Beginning in mid-2007, there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the devel- 

 10   MOODYS 2018 10-K

 oped and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in debt issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies. Since this financial crisis, many markets and economies have recovered and Moodys believes the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixed-income market and related financial information market, which includes information such as credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.  

Moodys growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including:  

 »    

Health of the worlds major economies;  

 »    

Debt capital markets activity;  

 »    

Disintermediation of credit markets;  

 »    

Fiscal and monetary policy of governments; and  

 »    

Business investment spending, including mergers and acquisitions.  

In an environment of increasing financial complexity and heightened attention to credit analysis and risk management, Moodys is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixed-income market activity and a more widespread use of credit ratings, research and related analytical products. Moodys expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.  

Strong secular trends should continue to provide long-term growth opportunities. For MIS, key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global GDP growth, continued disintermediation of fixed-income markets in both developed and emerging economies driving issuance and demand for new ratings products and services. Growth in MA is likely to be driven by deeper and broader penetration of the customer base as data demands, regulatory compliance and other analytical requirements drive demand for MAs products and expertise. Moreover, pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth opportunities for Moodys.  

Growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, business investment spending, corporate refinancing needs, merger and acquisition activity, issuer profits, consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity. Rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MISs revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. MISs results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies, the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments, and the decisions of issuers to request MIS ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings, insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially mitigate MISs dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets. Furthermore, the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid-1990s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil, with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010, before stabilizing in 2011 with Moodys experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012. Despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels, Moodys believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixed-income markets and provide opportunities for long-term revenue growth.  

The pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers ability to place securities outside their national markets and similarly investors ability to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets. Technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell, which in the absence of the appropriate technology might not be readily or easily obtainable. This availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide, giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of both established and newer capital markets. As technology provides broader access to worldwide markets, it also results in a greater need for credible, globally comparable opinions about credit risk, data, analytics and related services. Additionally, information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support Moodys continued expansion in developing markets.  

An ongoing trend in the worlds capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems. Issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or in substitution for, traditional financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or instead of, retaining those assets. Moodys believes that issuer use of global debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue. Further, disintermediation has continued because of the historically low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging, which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets.  

    MOODYS 2018 10-K     11

Moodys also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity. Thus, disintermediation is expected to continue over the longer-term, with Moodys targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust.  

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, banking, insurance and capital markets authorities promulgated a wide range of new regulations to restore stability and confidence in financial institutions under their oversight. Programs such as Basel III, Solvency II, and CCAR  among many others  prompted banks, insurers, securities dealers, and asset managers to invest in more robust risk management practices and systems. Many of these investments drew on expertise and tools offered by MA, resulting in strong revenue growth in the post-crisis period. As banking and capital markets continue to stabilize, and with financial institutions better capitalized, regulatory-driven demand for MA products has moderated. Nonetheless, we expect that MA products and services that enable compliance with financial regulation and accounting standards will continue to be adopted by institutions worldwide, prompted by periodic revisions to regulatory frameworks such as the Basel capital adequacy protocols. Moreover, having responded to regulatory imperatives, financial institutions are increasingly seeking to leverage investments in regulatory compliance systems to gain business insights and front-office efficiencies; MA is well positioned to realize revenue growth by assisting in these efforts to apply back-office analytics in support of front-line business decisions. Finally, in order to respond to other sources of demand and drive growth, MA is actively investing in new products, including enhanced data sets and improved delivery methods (e.g., software-as-a-service). These efforts should support broader distribution of MAs capabilities, deepen relationships with existing customers and facilitate more new customer acquisition.  

Legislative bodies and regulators in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of CRAs, which may result in, for example, an increased number of competitors, changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of MIS, removal of references to ratings in certain regulations, or increased costs of doing business for MIS. At present, Moodys is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities.  

Moodys operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, inherent in conducting business on a global basis. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions.  

COMPETITION  

MIS competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MISs ratings also have in-house credit research capabilities. MISs largest competitor in the global credit rating business is S&P Global Ratings (S&P), a division of S&P Global. There are some rating markets, based on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moodys has made investments and obtained market positions superior to S&P, while in other markets, the reverse is true.  

In addition to S&P, MISs competitors in the U.S. include Fitch Ratings, Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), A.M. Best Company, Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc., and Morningstar Inc. In Europe, there are approximately 45 companies currently registered with ESMA, which include both purely domestic European CRAs and International CRAs such as S&P, Fitch and DBRS. There are additional competitors in other regions and countries, some of which are global entities and compete across regions and asset classes, while others focus on particular asset classes and regions.  

MA competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as Refinitiv, Bloomberg, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Fitch Solutions, D&B, IBM, Wolters Kluwer, Fidelity National Information Services, SAS, Fiserv, MSCI and IHS Markit among others. MAs main competitors within RD&A include S&P Global Market Intelligence, CreditSights, Refinitiv, Intex, IHS Markit, BlackRock Solutions, FactSet and other providers of fixed income analytics, valuations, economic data and research. In ERS, MA faces competition from both large software providers such as IBM Algorithmics, Fidelity National Information Services, SAS, Oracle, Misys, Oliver Wyman, Verisk Analytics and various other vendors and in-house solutions. Within Professional Services, MA competes with a host of financial training and education firms and providers of offshore research and analytical services such as Evalueserve and CRISIL Global Research & Analytics.  

MOODYS STRATEGY  

Moodys corporate mission is to be the worlds most respected authority serving financial risk-sensitive markets. The key aspects to implement this strategy are to:  

 »    

Defend and enhance the core ratings and research business of MIS;  

 12   MOODYS 2018 10-K       

Table of Contents 

 »    

Build MAs position as a leading provider of data, analytics and risk management solutions to financial institutions, corporations, and governmental authorities; and  

 »    

Invest in strategic growth opportunities.  

Moodys will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the Company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending. Moodys will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets, move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the Company can leverage its brand, extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets.  

To broaden the Companys potential, MA provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions, corporations and governmental authorities to better manage risk. As such, MA adds to the Companys value proposition in three ways. First, MAs subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in volatility in MISs revenues. Second, MA products and services, such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices, provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before banking systems and debt capital markets fully develop and thus present long-term growth opportunities for the ratings business. Finally, MAs integrated risk management software platform embeds Moodys solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide.  

Moodys invests in initiatives to implement the Companys strategy, including internally led organic development and targeted acquisitions. Example initiatives include:  

 »    

Enhancements to ratings quality and product extensions;  

 »    

Investments that extend ownership and participation in joint ventures and strategic alliances;  

 »    

New products, services, content (e.g., non-credit risk assessments such as ESG and cybersecurity risk), and technology capabilities to meet customer demands;  

 »    

Selective bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate the ability to scale and grow Moodys businesses; and  

 »    

Expansion in emerging markets.  

During 2018, Moodys continued to invest in and acquire complementary businesses in MIS and MA. In May 2018, Moodys acquired a minority stake in QuantCube Technology, an innovative provider of real-time, AI-based predictive analytics for corporate customers, financial institutions and investment managers. The investment complements a series of initiatives across the company to harness innovative and emerging technologies. In August 2018, Moodys acquired Omega Performance, a leading provider of online credit training. The acquisition adds to MAs suite of industry-leading learning solutions and reinforces MA as a market standard in credit proficiency for financial institutions worldwide. In October 2018, Moodys invested in Team8 Partners II, L.P., the second vehicle raised by Team8, a leading think tank and company creation platform specializing in cybersecurity and data resilience. The investment builds on Moodys investments and initiatives in cybersecurity and emerging technologies. Also in October 2018, Moodys completed the acquisition of Reis, Inc., a leading provider of U.S. commercial real estate (CRE) data. The acquisition further expands MAs network of data and analytics providers in the CRE space, including investments in start-ups that apply innovative approaches and new technologies to source data and deliver tools to the market. In November 2018, Moodys announced it had entered an agreement to acquire a minority stake in ICR Chile, a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Chile. The transaction adds to Moodys growing presence across Latin America.  

REGULATION  

MIS and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). Thus, existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Companys operations and the markets for securities that it rates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact Moodys operations or profitability, the Companys ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moodys operates.  

The regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years, and continues to evolve. In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered CRA industry throughout the EU. MIS is a registered entity and is subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection. Applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional  

    MOODYS 2018 10-K     13    

Table of Contents 

 or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed, reporting requirements to ESMA regarding fees, and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services. In 2016, the Commission published a report concluding that no new European legislation was needed for the industry at that time, but that it would continue to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation. In addition, from time to time, ESMA publishes interpretive guidance, or thematic reports regarding various aspects of the regulation. Two such reports were published in the first half of 2018. The first report provided further guidance from ESMA regarding the endorsement mechanism that CRAs will need to employ for those ratings that are produced outside of the EU but are used inside the EU by EU-regulated entities. The second report discussed ESMAs observations on CRAs fee practices. Further, in March 2018, ESMA published a consultation report seeking feedback on the extent to which EU regulation should be applied to CRAs operating outside of the EU to make their ratings eligible for regulatory use in the EU. In July 2018, ESMA published its final guidance on the applicability of EU regulation to endorsed ratings, with an effective date of January 1, 2019. In the final guidance, ESMA indicated that as long as the underlying principles of the EU rules were adhered to, ESMA did not expect that the EUs CRA rules would need to be exported to non-EU jurisdictions for endorsement purposes.  

Separately, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted through a referendum to exit the EU. The U.K. officially launched the exit process by submitting its Article 50 letter to the EU, informing it of the U.K.s intention to exit. The submission of this letter started the clock on the negotiation of the terms of exit, which originally was expected to take up to two years, but may take longer.  

The longer-term impacts of the decision to leave the EU on the overall regulatory framework for the U.K. will depend, in part, on the relationship that the U.K. negotiates with the EU in the future. In the interim, however, the U.K.s markets regulator (the Financial Conduct Authority) has indicated that all EU financial regulations will stay in place and that firms must continue to abide by their existing obligations. As a consequence, at this point in time, there is no change to the regulatory framework under which MIS operates and ESMA remains MISs regulator both in the EU and in the U.K.  

In the U.S., CRAs are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. The SEC is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to Congress on NRSROs. The Financial Reform Act requires the SEC to examine each NRSRO once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings, among other requirements. The annual report required by the Reform Act details the SECs views on the state of competition, transparency and conflicts of interests among NRSROs, among other requirements. The SEC voted in August 2014 to adopt its final rules for NRSROs as required by the Financial Reform Act. The Company has made and continues to make substantial IT and other investments, and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations.  

In light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the EU and the U.S. (as well as many other countries), periodically and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation, these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry. In addition, other legislation and/or interpretation of existing regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future. Finally, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. If enacted, any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which MIS operates. The legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future. Management of the Company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted, the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings, or regulatory or legislative actions, or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position, financial position or results of operations of Moodys.
