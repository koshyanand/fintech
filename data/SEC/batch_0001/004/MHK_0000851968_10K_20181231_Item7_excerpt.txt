Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Mohawk is a significant supplier of every major flooring category with manufacturing operations in 19 nations and sales in more than 170 countries. Based on its annual sales, the Company believes it is the world’s largest flooring manufacturer. A majority of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States and Europe, which are also the Company’s primary markets. The Company expects continued growth in the United States market consistent with residential housing starts and remodeling investments and has invested significantly in state-of-the-art manufacturing to create aspirational products to delight consumers with beauty and performance. The Company also is a leading provider of flooring for the U.S. commercial market and has earned significant recognition for its innovation in design and performance and sustainable practices. Additionally, the Company maintains significant operations in Europe, Russia, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and other parts of the world. The Company is growing share in many markets through its differentiated products, especially its ceramic tile collections.

During the past two decades, the Company has grown significantly. Its current geographic breadth and diverse product offering are reflected in three reporting segments: Global Ceramic; Flooring North America (“Flooring NA”); and Flooring Rest of the World (“Flooring ROW”). The Global Ceramic Segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone tile and other products including natural stone, quartz and porcelain slab countertops, which it distributes primarily in North America, Europe, Brazil and Russia through various selling channels, which include company-owned stores, independent distributors and home centers. The Flooring NA Segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering product lines, including carpets, rugs, carpet cushion, wood, laminate and vinyl products, including luxury vinyl tile (LVT), which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using Company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. The Segment’s product lines are sold through various selling channels, including independent floor covering retailers, distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, online retailers, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. The Flooring ROW Segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, wood flooring, carpets, roofing elements, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard (“MDF”), chipboards, other wood products and vinyl products, including LVT, which it distributes primarily in Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand through various selling channels, which include independent floor covering retailers, independent distributors, company-owned distributors, home centers, commercial contractors and commercial end users.

The Company expects sales growth to continue on a local basis in 2019, even with some softening in the European and Australian markets, offset by projected growth in Russia, Brazil and Mexico. The Company has also implemented multiple product price increases in most product categories due to escalating material, transportation and energy costs in most markets. The Company is managing through current macroeconomic headwinds including significant inflation, a strong U.S. dollar that is impacting currency translation as well as strengthening the competiveness of imports in the U.S. and slowing housing markets in a number of countries. While focused on addressing current conditions, the Company also established a long-term growth strategy, which includes strategic acquisitions in key growth markets and targeted internal investments that are expanding the Company’s geographic reach and product portfolio.

In 2018, the Company completed five acquisitions: two that expanded the Company’s global footprint with leadership positions in major markets and three that expanded the Company’s product offering and distribution in Europe. The Godfrey Hirst acquisition established the Company as the largest flooring manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, with leading carpet and hard surface positions in both countries when combined with the Company’s existing regional flooring distribution business. Godfrey Hirst’s prestigious wool carpet collections are exported to numerous international markets and have been integrated into the U.S. soft surface product portfolio to expand sales. The acquisition of Brazil-based Eliane provided the Company with a leading ceramic tile position and the most appealing brand in one of the world’s largest ceramic markets and created a gateway into the overall South American market as Eliane is Brazil’s largest ceramic exporter. The acquisition of Berghoef, a leading European mezzanine flooring company, created a leading position in a category that is rapidly expanding due to increased construction of e-commerce warehousing across the continent. The acquisition of Swiss and Italian hard surface distributors expanded the Company’s direct distribution of flooring sales in Europe.

In 2018, the Company invested over $794.1 million in capital projects to, introduce new product categories, enter new markets, expand capacity of constrained premium products and improve productivity. In 2019, the Company plans to invest an additional $550-$580 million in its existing businesses to complete projects that were begun in 2018 and to commence new initiatives. The largest investments during this two-year period are the expansion of LVT in the U.S. and Europe, including the launch of manufactured rigid LVT collections; ceramic capacity increases in the U.S., Mexico, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and Russia as well as in the Company’s newly acquired ceramic business in Brazil, where the Company is investing in new assets to dramatically improve profitability as it did with the Marazzi acquisition; new porcelain slab production in Europe and Russia; premium water-resistant laminate in the U.S., Europe and Russia; carpet tile in Europe; sheet vinyl and premium sanitary ware in Russia; quartz

countertops in the U.S., where the Company now produces and distributes materials for all kitchen and bath surfaces; and residential and commercial carpet in the U.S. and Australia, where the Company is investing in assets to expand its commercial carpet presence in the recent Godfrey Hirst acquisition. 

Net earnings attributable to the Company were $861.7 million, or diluted EPS of $11.47 for 2018 compared to net earnings attributable to the Company of $971.6 million, or diluted EPS of $12.98 for 2017. The decrease in EPS was primarily attributable 

to higher inflation, higher start-up costs, and costs due to temporarily reducing production to align with softer market conditions, 

partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix, increased sales volume, productivity gained from capital investments, cost reduction initiatives and decreased income tax expense. The Company benefited from a lower effective tax rate as a result of the recent reforms in the U.S. and Belgium.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company generated $1,181.3 million of cash from operating activities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $119.1 million, of which $31.0 million was in the United States and $88.1 million was in foreign countries.

Recent Events

On November 16, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Eliane S/A Revestimentos Ceramicos, one of the largest ceramic tile companies in Brazil, further extending Mohawk’s global position in new markets. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the Company (i) acquired the entire issued share capital of Eliane and (ii) acquired $99.0 million of indebtedness of Eliane, with total cash consideration paid of $148.7 million including cash held in escrow of $5.3 million.

On January 31, 2019, the Company completed an acquisition of a hard surface flooring distribution company based in the Netherlands for approximately €60.6 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross profit

Gross profit for 2018 was $2,838.1 million (28.4% of net sales), a decrease of $158.3 million or 5.3%, compared to gross profit of $2,996.4 million (31.6% of net sales) for 2017. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased 314 basis points. The decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs of approximately $230 million, including increased material costs of approximately $140 million, approximately $40 million of start-up costs associated with large investments to expand sales, add product categories and enter new markets, approximately $37 million of costs due to temporarily reducing production, and the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related and other costs of approximately $13 million, partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $68 million, higher sales volume of approximately $54 million and savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $28 million and the net impact of favorable foreign exchange rates of approximately $12 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15 basis points. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in dollars was primarily attributable to approximately $45 million of costs due to higher sales volume, approximately $19 million of costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel, and marketing, higher inflation costs of approximately 

26
Index to Financial Statements

$15 million, and the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related and other costs of approximately $19 million. 

Operating income

Operating income for 2018 was $1,095.3 million (11.0% of net sales) reflecting a decrease of $258.8 million, or 19.1%, compared to operating income of $1,354.2 million (14.3% of net sales) for 2017. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs of approximately $246 million, including increased material costs of approximately $140 million, approximately $48 million of start-up costs associated with large investments to expand sales, add product categories, and enter new markets, approximately $32 million due to the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related, and other costs, approximately $37 million of costs due to temporarily reducing production, and approximately $13 million of costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel, marketing, and the net impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $68 million, increased sales volume of approximately $9 million, and savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $35 million. 

Global Ceramic Segment—Operating income was $442.9 million (12.5% of segment net sales) for 2018 reflecting a decrease of $82.5 million, or 15.7%, compared to operating income of $525.4 million (15.4% of segment net sales) for 2017. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs of approximately $97 million, the unfavorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $28 million, approximately $25 million of costs due to temporarily reducing production, and approximately $11 million of costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel, and marketing, partially offset by savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $63 million, and increased sales volume of approximately $24 million.

Flooring NA Segment—Operating income was $347.9 million (8.6% of segment net sales) for 2018 reflecting a decrease of $192.4 million, or 35.6%, compared to operating income of $540.3 million (13.5% of segment net sales) for 2017. The decrease 

in operating income was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs of approximately $126 million, including increased material costs of approximately $108 million, an increase in costs of approximately $64 million due to lower than expected production volumes, the ramp up of new products and higher logistics costs, lower sales volume of approximately $23 million, approximately $16 million of start-up costs associated with large investments to expand sales, add product categories, and enter new markets, and approximately $13 million of costs due to temporarily reducing production, partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $43 million, and savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $17 million. 

Flooring ROW Segment—Operating income was $345.8 million (14.4% of segment net sales) for 2018 reflecting an increase of $16.7 million, or 5.1%, compared to operating income of $329.1 million (15.9% of segment net sales) for 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $54 million, savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $20 million, increased sales volume of approximately $4 million, partially offset by approximately $27 million of start-up costs associated with large investments to expand sales, add product categories, and enter new markets, higher inflation costs of approximately $23 million, and $16 million due to the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs.

Interest expense

Interest expense was $38.8 million for 2018, reflecting an increase of $7.7 million compared to interest expense of $31.1 million for 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in interest rates during 2018 and the early extinguishment of acquisition debt.

Other expense (income)

Other expense was $7.3 million for 2018, reflecting an unfavorable change of $2.1 million compared to other income of $5.2 million for 2017. The change was primarily due to the increased unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on transactions in the current year.

Income tax expense

For 2018, the Company recorded income tax expense of $184.3 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,049.2 million for an effective tax rate of 17.6%, as compared to an income tax expense of $343.2 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,317.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 26.0% for 2017. The decrease in the year-over-year tax expense of $158.9 million was primarily driven by the geographic dispersion of the Company’s earnings for 2018, subject to tax at the reduced rates in effect in the U.S. and Belgium, of $181.6 million, and the reduction to the transition tax and related tax planning initiatives of $163.4 million, partially offset by the one-time 2017 restatement of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities of $139.9 million, the one-time Italian tax planning election of $10.3 million, the restatement of certain state deferred tax assets of $20.4 million, and various other items of $15.5 million.

In December of 2017, the U.S. and Belgium enacted tax reform legislation. The U.S. legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), is the most significant and complex change to the U.S. tax law in more than 30 years and requires the combined effort of the Company’s finance, tax, and treasury departments to ensure the proper accounting of its comprehensive changes. The most significant provisions of the TCJA, were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementation of a territorial income tax regime, and imposition of a transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The most significant provisions of the Belgium legislation were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 33.99% to 29.58% for 2018 and 2019, with a further reduction to 25% effective January 1, 2020, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses, and creation of a consolidated corporate income tax regime.

As a result of the tax reform legislation, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.8 million related primarily to the non-cash tax benefit of the revaluation of its Belgian deferred tax liabilities, the non-cash tax benefit of the provisional revaluation of its U.S. deferred tax liabilities, and the tax expense of the provisional accrual associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax. This represented a reasonable estimate of the impact of all tax law changes on the Company’s financial statements in accordance with SAB 118. In accordance with the SAB 118 measurement period, the Company has completed its accounting for the income tax effects of all elements of the TCJA. See Note 13-Income Taxes.

Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related, and other costs were higher in 2017 primarily due to the absence of approximately $90 million received in 2016 related to a contract dispute, partially offset by the approximately $48 million charge related to the write-off of the Lees tradename that was recorded in 2016.

Operating income

Operating income for 2017 was $1,354.2 million (14.3% of net sales) reflecting an increase of $74.2 million, or 5.8%, compared to operating income of $1,279.9 million (14.3% of net sales) for 2016.

The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to higher input costs of approximately $80 million, including increased material costs of approximately $76 million, costs associated with investments in expansion of production capacity of approximately $7 million, approximately $6 million of costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel, and marketing, the unfavorable net impact of exchange rates of approximately $5 million, and approximately $22 million in decreased sales volumes, primarily attributable to lower patent revenue. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $37 million, and the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $80 million.

Interest expense

Interest expense was $31.1 million for 2017, reflecting a decrease of $9.4 million compared to interest expense of $40.5 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the Company’s borrowings to lower interest rate instruments.

Other expense (income)

Other expense was $5.2 million for 2017, reflecting an unfavorable change of $6.9 million compared to other income of $1.7 million for 2016. The change was primarily due to the increased unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on transactions in the current year.

Income tax expense

For 2017, the Company recorded income tax expense of $343.2 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,317.9 million for an effective tax rate of 26.0%, as compared to an income tax expense of $307.6 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,241.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.8% for 2016. The increase in the year-over-year effective tax rate was the direct result of the geographic dispersion of the Company’s earnings for 2017, decreased by $44.4 million caused by the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities triggered by the Belgium corporate income tax reform, and increased by a one-time provisional net tax expense of $45.2 million resulting from the U.S. corporate income tax reform.

In December of 2017, the U.S. and Belgium enacted tax reform legislation. The U.S. legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), is the most significant and complex change to the U.S. tax law in more than 30 years. The most significant provisions of the TCJA, were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementation of a territorial income tax regime, and imposition of a transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The most significant provisions of the Belgium legislation were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 33.99% to 29.58% for January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019, respectively, with a further reduction to 25% effective January 1, 2020, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses, and creation of a consolidated corporate income tax regime.

Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.8 million related primarily to the non-cash tax benefit of the revaluation of its Belgian deferred tax liabilities, the non-cash tax benefit of the provisional revaluation of its U.S. deferred tax liabilities, and the tax expense of the provisional accrual associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax. See Note 13-Income Taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s primary liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Company’s liquidity needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds, commercial paper, bank credit lines, term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of $347.7 million available under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility. The Company also maintains local currency revolving lines of credit and other credit facilities to provide liquidity to its businesses around the world. None of such local facilities are material in amount.

Index to Financial Statements

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2018 was $1,181.3 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1,193.6 million for the year ended 2017. This decrease of $12.3 million was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating income and changes in working capital, reflecting normal fluctuations relative to the timing and nature of these transactions. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2017 as compared to 2016 of $151.7 million was primarily attributable to changes in working capital.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2018 was $1,332.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,240.7 million for the year ended 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $318.2 million increase in acquisitions, partially offset by a $111.9 million reduction in capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities in 2017 increased over 2016 by $568.6 million due primarily to acquisitions of $250.8 million, $83.9 million purchase of short-term investments, and an increase in capital expenditures of $233.9 million. The Company will continue to invest to optimize sales and profit growth with product expansion and cost reduction projects in the business. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 2018 was $198.0 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.0 million for the year ended 2017. The change in cash provided by financing is primarily attributable to increased borrowings of commercial paper, offset by purchases of the Company’s shares of $274.1 million. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 2017 was $7.0 million compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 2016 of $641.6 million. This reduction of $634.6 million is primarily attributable to the issuance and sale of $357.6 million in Floating Rate Notes in 2017 and the repayment of senior notes of $645.6 million in 2016.

Senior Credit Facility

On March 26, 2015, the Company amended and restated its 2013 senior credit facility increasing its size from $1,000.0 million to $1,800.0 million and extending the maturity from September 25, 2018 to March 26, 2020 (as amended and restated, the “2015 Senior Credit Facility”). The 2015 Senior Credit Facility eliminated certain provisions in the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, including those that: (a) accelerated the maturity date to 90 days prior to the maturity of senior notes due in January 2016 if certain specified liquidity levels were not met; and (b) required that certain subsidiaries guarantee the Company’s obligations if the Company’s credit ratings fell below investment grade. The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also modified certain negative covenants to provide the Company with additional flexibility, including flexibility to make acquisitions and incur additional indebtedness. On March 1, 2016, the Company amended the 2015 Senior Credit Facility to, among other things, carve out from the general limitation on subsidiary indebtedness the issuance of Euro-denominated commercial paper notes by subsidiaries. Additionally, at several points in 2016, the Company extended the maturity date of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility from March 26, 2020 to March 26, 2021. In the first half of 2017, the Company amended the 2015 Senior Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from March 26, 2021 to March 26, 2022. 

At the Company’s election, revolving loans under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 1.00% and 1.75% (1.125% as of December 31, 2018), or (b) the higher of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the 2015 Senior Credit Facility) rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% (0.125% as of December 31, 2018). The Company also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the lenders exceed utilization of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility ranging from 0.10% to 0.225% per annum (0.125% as of December 31, 2018). The applicable margins and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the Company’s Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable). 

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company’s business. The Company is also required to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The limitations contain customary exceptions or, in certain cases, do not apply as long as the Company is in compliance with the financial ratio requirements and is not otherwise in default.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

In 2017, the Company paid financing costs of $0.6 million in connection with the extension of its 2015 Senior Credit Facility from March 26, 2021 to March 26, 2022. These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of $6.9 million are being amortized over the term of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2018, amounts utilized under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility included $57.9 million of borrowings and $54.6 million of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments. The outstanding borrowings of $1,339.8 million under the Company’s U.S. and European commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2018 reduce the availability of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility. Including commercial paper borrowings, the Company has utilized $1,452.3 million under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of $347.7 million available as of December 31, 2018. 

Commercial Paper

On February 28, 2014 and July 31, 2015, the Company established programs for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the United States and Eurozone capital markets, respectively. Commercial paper issued under the U.S. and European programs will have maturities ranging up to 397 and 183 days, respectively. None of the commercial paper notes may be voluntarily prepaid or redeemed by the Company and all rank pari passu with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. To the extent that the Company issues European commercial paper notes through a subsidiary of the Company, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The Company uses its 2015 Senior Credit Facility as a liquidity backstop for its commercial paper programs. Accordingly, the total amount outstanding under all of the Company's commercial paper programs may not exceed $1,800.0 million (less any amounts drawn on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility) at any time.

The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes will be available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018 there was $632.7 million outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program, and the euro equivalent of $707.2 million under the European program. The weighted-average interest rate and maturity period for the U.S. program were 2.98% and 27.64 days, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate and maturity period for the European program were (0.21)% and 28.61 days, respectively.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a three-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the “Securitization Facility”). On September 11, 2014, the Company made certain modifications to its Securitization Facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from $300.0 million to $500.0 million and decreased the interest margins on certain borrowings. Amounts borrowed under the Securitization Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.70% per annum and the borrower paid a commitment fee at a per annum rate of 0.30% on the unused amount of each lender’s commitment.

Other

The Company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved may be material.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash of $119.1 million, of which $88.1 million was held outside the United States. The Company plans to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the United States. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and debt servicing requirements over the next twelve months.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company has repurchased $274.1 million of its shares of common stock pursuant to the $500 million program announced in October. All of these repurchases have been financed through the Company’s operations and existing finance arrangements. See Item 5 - Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting policies require the Company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Acquisition Accounting. The fair value of the consideration the Company pay for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill. The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for the business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on the Company’s financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates. See Note 2-Acquisitions for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.

35
Index to Financial Statements

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2018.

•Income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. For further information regarding the Company’s valuation allowances, see Note 13-Income Taxes.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) 740-10. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. For further information regarding the Company’s uncertain tax positions, see Note 13-Income Taxes.

•Environmental and legal accruals. Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company consults with its internal experts. The Company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1(u), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Company’s accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on the Company’s disclosures, results of operations, and financial condition.

Impact of Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. The Company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the Company’s production processes. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. In the past, the Company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its Flooring NA and Global Ceramic segments, the second quarter typically sees the higher net sales and operating income, followed by the first and third quarters. The results of operations for the fourth quarter tends to be the weakest. These results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following. The Flooring ROW segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net earnings followed by moderate first and third quarters and a weaker fourth quarter.
