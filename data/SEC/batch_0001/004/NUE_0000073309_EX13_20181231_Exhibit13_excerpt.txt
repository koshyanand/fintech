Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Overview  

The strong U.S. economy drove steel demand higher in 2018, helping fuel Nucors record earnings. The U.S. economy grew about 3%, compared to 2.3% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2016. This year we saw solid demand for steel in nearly every market we serve. The average utilization rates of all operating facilities in our steel mills, steel products and raw materials segments were approximately 91%, 71% and 72%, respectively, in 2018, compared with 86%, 65% and 65%, respectively, in 2017. All of our product groups in the steel mills segment realized improved utilization rates in 2018 over the prior year. Industry-wide, the U.S. capacity utilization rate was 78.3% for 2018, its highest annual rate since 2008.  

The Section 232 steel tariffs provided us a tailwind in 2018 to the strong economy. For the full year 2018, steel imports were down more than 10% from the previous year and accounted for approximately 23% of U.S. market share. About 4.1 million fewer tons of imports entered the United States in 2018. Ninety percent of the decrease in imports, took place after the tariffs were fully implemented on June 1, 2018. The strong economy and lower imports generated 5 to 6 million tons in increased production for the U.S. steel industry this year.  

We expect 2019 to be another good year for the U.S. steel industry. Most of the economic indicators we track continue to look favorable. While the economy may not grow at the same pace in 2019, we believe it will be strong compared to recent history. As we enter 2019, of the 24 end markets Nucor serves, we believe that 20 are improving, three are steady, and one is declining.  

Our Challenges and Risks  

Sales of many of our products are largely dependent upon capital spending in the nonresidential construction markets in the United States, including in the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as capital spending on infrastructure that is publicly funded, such as bridges, schools, prisons and hospitals. We are encouraged by the Trump administrations recent commentary on initiatives that should spur greater economic growth, including increased infrastructure spending, the rolling back of excessive regulations and the encouragement of domestic energy production.  

While the Section 232 tariffs are having their intended impact by keeping unfairly traded imports out of the U.S. market, global steel production overcapacity continues to be a long-term challenge. Steel production in China rose in 2018, going from 960 million tons in 2017 to 1.02 billion tons in 2018  an increase of 6.6%. Chinas share of global crude steel production rose from 50.3% in 2017 to 51.3% in 2018. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that global excess steel production capacity was approximately 600 million tons at the end of 2017, a drop from its peak levels in 2015 and 2016. Nearly half of that excess capacity is located in China, where the largest steel companies are state-owned and receive significant financial support from the Chinese government.  

The Trump administration reached agreements with Argentina, Brazil and South Korea to exempt those countries from the steel tariffs in exchange for quotas on the amount of steel they export to the United States. Discussions with other trading partners, including the E.U., Canada, Mexico and Japan, could result in similar exemptions from the tariffs in exchange for quotas. The Trump administration is also negotiating with China after the United States imposed tariffs on a broad array of Chinese products. One of the goals of the Trump administration in those talks is getting China to agree to structural reforms in its economy, including the role of state-owned enterprises. Failure to address the overcapacity problem in the steel industry could adversely impact U.S. steelmakers by encouraging dumping steel products in our market, particularly if the Section 232 tariffs are lifted in the future.  

The United States also reached a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Several new provisions in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the USMCA), including increasing the rules of origin requirements for various products, should result in the use of more North American steel and other materials. Increasing these requirements, particularly for automotive production, will benefit North American steelmakers. However, the USMCA cannot take effect until it is passed by both houses in Congress. At this time, prospects for passage in 2019 are uncertain.  

A major uncertainty we continue to face in our business is the price of our principal raw material, ferrous scrap, which is volatile and often increases or decreases rapidly in response to changes in domestic demand, unanticipated events that affect the flow of scrap into scrap yards, the availability of scrap substitutes and changes in foreign demand for scrap. In periods of rapidly increasing raw material prices in the industry, which are often also associated with periods of strong or rapidly improving steel market conditions, being able to increase our prices for the products we sell quickly enough to offset increases in the prices we pay for ferrous scrap is challenging but critical to maintaining our profitability. We attempt to mitigate the scrap price risk by managing scrap inventory levels at the steel mills to match the anticipated demand over the next several weeks. Certain scrap substitutes, including pig iron, have longer lead times for  

24   

 delivery than scrap, which can make this inventory management strategy difficult to achieve. Continued successful implementation of our raw material strategy, including key investments in direct reduced iron (DRI) production coupled with the scrap brokerage and processing services performed by our team at The David J. Joseph Company (DJJ), gives us greater control over our metallic inputs and thus also helps us to mitigate this risk.  

During periods of stronger or improving steel market conditions, we are more likely to be able to pass through to our customers, relatively quickly, the increased costs of ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, protecting our gross margins from significant erosion. During weaker or rapidly deteriorating steel market conditions, weak steel demand, low industry utilization rates and the impact of imports create an even more intensified competitive environment. All of those factors, to some degree, impact pricing, which increases the likelihood that Nucor will experience lower gross margins.  

Although the majority of our steel sales are to spot market customers who place their orders each month based on their business needs and our pricing competitiveness compared to both domestic and global producers and trading companies, we also sell contract tons, primarily in our sheet operations. Approximately 75% of our sheet sales were to contract customers in 2018 (65% in 2017 and 60% in 2016), with the balance in the spot market at the prevailing prices at the time of sale. Steel contract sales outside of our sheet operations are not significant. The amount of tons sold to contract customers depends on the overall market conditions at the time, how the end-use customers see the market moving forward and the strategy that Nucor management believes is appropriate to the upcoming period.  

Nucor management considerations include maintaining an appropriate balance of spot and contract tons based on market projections and appropriately supporting our diversified customer base. The percentage of tons that is placed under contract also depends on the overall market dynamics and customer negotiations. In years of strengthening demand, we typically see an increase in the percentage of sheet sales sold under contract as our customers have an expectation that transaction prices will rapidly rise and available capacity will quickly be sold out. To mitigate this risk, customers prefer to enter into contracts in order to obtain committed volumes of supply from the mills. Our contracts include a method of adjusting prices on a periodic basis to reflect changes in the market pricing for steel and/or scrap. Market indices for steel generally trend with scrap pricing changes but during periods of steel market weakness the more intensified competitive steel market environment can cause the sales price indices to decrease resulting in reduced gross margins and profitability. Furthermore, since the selling price adjustments are not immediate, there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make to our contract selling prices. Generally, in periods of increasing scrap prices, we experience a short-term margin contraction on contract tons. Conversely, in periods of decreasing scrap prices, we typically experience a short-term margin expansion. Contract sales typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months.  

Another significant uncertainty we face is the cost of energy. Nucor utilizes natural gas as both a raw material in the steel making process and for fuel supply. The availability and prices of electricity and natural gas are influenced today by many factors, including fuel switching (coal to natural gas by public utilities), changes in supply and demand, and pipeline and export infrastructure expansion. Proposed federal and state regulations of greenhouse gas emissions for new and refurbished power plants could increase our cost of electricity in future years. Such regulations are encouraging the development of renewable energy portfolios (e.g., wind and solar) that typically result in higher electricity prices. Stringent greenhouse gas regulations would give domestic producers a significant cost disadvantage in the international marketplace. We are monitoring these regulatory developments closely and will seek to educate public policy makers during any adoption process about their potential impact on our business and the U.S. manufacturing base.  

Our Strengths and Opportunities  

We are North Americas most diversified steel producer. As a result, our short-term performance is not tied to any one market. Over the last decade, we have invested more than $9 billion in projects that are not only diversifying our product offerings but also the markets that we serve. We expect these investments to grow our long-term earnings power by increasing our channels to market, expanding our product portfolio into higher value-added offerings that are less vulnerable to imports, improving our cost structure and further building upon our market leadership positions.  

Nucors raw material supply chain is another important strength. Our investment in DRI production facilities and scrap brokerage and processing businesses provides Nucor with significant flexibility in optimizing our raw materials costs. Additionally, having a significant portion of our raw materials supply under our control minimizes risk associated with the global sourcing of raw materials, particularly since a considerable portion of scrap substitutes comes from regions of the world that historically have experienced greater political turmoil.  

25   

Our highly variable, low-cost structure, combined with our financial strength and liquidity, has allowed us to successfully navigate cyclical, severely depressed steel industry market conditions in the past. In such times, our incentive-based pay system reduces our payroll costs, both hourly and salary, which helps to offset lower selling prices. Our pay-for-performance system that is closely tied to our levels of production also allows us to keep our workforce intact and to continue operating our facilities when some of our competitors with greater fixed costs are forced to shut down some of their facilities. Because we use electric arc furnaces to produce our steel, we can easily vary our production levels to match short-term changes in demand, unlike our blast furnace-based integrated competitors. We believe these strengths also provide us further opportunities to gain market share during such times.  

Evaluating Our Operating Performance  

We report our results of operations in three segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. Most of the steel we produce in our mills is sold to outside customers (80% in 2018), but a significant percentage is used internally by many of the facilities in our steel products segment (20% in 2018).  

We begin measuring our performance by comparing our net sales, both in total and by individual segment, during a reporting period with our net sales in the corresponding period in the prior year. In doing so, we focus on changes in and the reasons for such changes in the two key variables that have the greatest influence on our net sales: average sales price per ton during the period and total tons shipped to outside customers.  

We also focus on both dollar and percentage changes in gross margins, which are key drivers of our profitability, and the reasons for such changes. There are many factors from period to period that can affect our gross margins. One consistent area of focus for us is changes in metal margins, which is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes. Increases or decreases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes that are not offset by changes in the selling price of steel can quickly compress or expand our margins and reduce or increase our profitability.  

Because energy is a key input to our manufacturing processes, material changes in energy costs per ton can significantly affect our gross margins as well. Lower energy costs per ton increase our gross margins. Generally, our energy costs per ton are lower when the average utilization rates of all operating facilities in our steel mills segment are higher.  

Changes in marketing, administrative and other expenses, particularly profit sharing and other variable incentive-based payment costs, can have a material effect on our results of operations for a reporting period as well. These costs vary significantly from period to period as they are based upon changes in our pre-tax earnings and other profitability metrics that are a reflection of our pay-for-performance system that is closely tied to our levels of production.  

Evaluating Our Financial Condition  

We evaluate our financial condition each reporting period by focusing primarily on the amounts of and reasons for changes in cash provided by operating activities, our current ratio, the turnover rate of our accounts receivable and inventories, the amount and reasons for changes in cash used in or provided by investing activities and financing activities and our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments position at period end. Our conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today. As a result, our financial position remains strong.  

Segment Realignment  

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company began reporting its tubular products and piling businesses as part of the steel products segment. These businesses were previously included in the steel mills segment. All prior period segment data presented in the ensuing analysis have been recast to reflect this change.

Comparison of 2018 to 2017  

Results of Operations  

Net Sales  Net sales to external customers by segment for 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands):   

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net sales for 2018 increased 24% from the prior year. Average sales price per ton increased 18% from $764 in 2017 to $899 in 2018. Total tons shipped to outside customers increased 5% from 26,492,000 tons in 2017 to 27,899,000 tons in 2018.  

In the steel mills segment, sales tons were as follows (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net sales for the steel mills segment increased 26% in 2018 from the prior year due to a 21% increase in the average sales price per ton, from $676 in 2017 to $817 in 2018, as well as a 4% increase in total tons shipped to outside customers. All of our steel mill products experienced higher average selling prices in 2018 as compared to 2017, with the sheet mills having the most significant impact on the segments net sales increase in 2018. In addition, all product groups within the steel mills segment, except for sheet products, experienced an increase in tons sold to outside customers in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The improved volumes and higher average selling prices combined to result in increased sales for the steel mills segment in every quarter of 2018 when compared to the respective prior year quarter.  

Outside sales tonnage for the steel products segment was as follows (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

27   

Net sales for the steel products segment increased 22% in 2018 from the prior year due to a 9% increase in total tons sold to outside customers and a 12% increase in the average sales price per ton from $1,252 in 2017 to $1,402 in 2018. Sales during 2018 followed the typical seasonal pattern that we also experienced in 2017. Total sales were lowest in the first quarter while volumes were lowest in the fourth quarter as winter weather conditions had their greatest impact on nonresidential construction markets. Conditions improved in the second quarter and continued through the third quarter as higher average selling prices per ton mostly offset the decline in volumes during the fourth quarter as seasonal factors began to return. The increase in net sales for the steel products segment was also impacted by the higher volumes and average selling prices of our tubular products, rebar fabrication and cold finish operations in 2018 as compared to 2017.  

Net sales for the raw materials segment increased 16% in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to higher volumes and average selling prices in DJJs brokerage operations. Approximately 90% of outside sales in the raw materials segment in 2018 were from DJJs brokerage operations and approximately 9% of outside sales were from DJJs scrap processing operations (88% and 10%, respectively, in 2017).  

Gross Margins  In 2018, Nucor recorded gross margins of $4.30 billion (17%) which was an increase from $2.57 billion (13%) in 2017:  

       

The primary driver for the increase in gross margin in 2018 as compared to 2017 was increased metal margins in the steel mills segment. Metal margin is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes. Partially offsetting the previously mentioned increases in the steel mills segments average selling prices and volumes in 2018 as compared to 2017 was increased scrap and scrap substitute costs. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used was $361 in 2018, an 18% increase from $307 in 2017.  

   Scrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other iron-based raw materials used to make steel. Scrap prices increased during the first half of 2018 with prices leveling out during the third quarter and declining through the end of the year. As we enter 2019, scrap prices have decreased slightly, a trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2018. We do not expect significant scrap price volatility over the next several months.  

       

Steel mill energy costs decreased approximately $1 per ton in 2018 compared with 2017 mainly due to lower unit costs for natural gas.  

       

Gross margins in the steel products segment for 2018 increased over 2017 due to the increased profitability of most of the businesses in the segment. The most significant increase was in our tubular products businesses, while our deck, building systems and cold finish businesses also experienced noticeable improvement in performance in 2018 as compared to 2017.  

As a result of the rapid and significant increase in the cost of steel inputs during 2018, the operating results for our rebar fabrication business declined significantly in the first quarter of 2018 and remained depressed throughout the remainder of the year. Nucor expects the operating results of this reporting unit to improve when the cost of steel in relation to the reporting units backlog stabilizes.  

       

Improved gross margins in the raw materials segment in 2018 compared to 2017 were primarily due to improved performance from our DRI operations. The performance of Nucor Steel Louisiana was significantly improved in 2018 as compared to 2017, during which the facility experienced unplanned outages in the first, third and fourth quarters of 2017. The Louisiana DRI facility established new annual records in 2018 for plant uptime, production and shipments.  

Gross margins in the raw materials segment also benefited from $27.6 million in insurance recoveries.  

       

Contributing to the improvement in gross margins in 2018 compared to 2017 was the strong performance of DJJs scrap processing and brokerage operations. In addition to the increases in average sales prices and volumes, DJJs scrap processing operations expanded their margin per ton in 2018 as compared to 2017.  

28   

Marketing, Administrative and Other Expenses  A major component of marketing, administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs. These costs, which are based upon and fluctuate with Nucors financial performance, increased from 2017 to 2018 due to our increased profitability in 2018. In 2018, profit sharing costs consisted of $307.9 million of contributions, including the Companys matching contribution, made to the Companys Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings Plan for qualified employees ($169.4 million in 2017). Other bonus costs also fluctuate based on Nucors achievement of certain financial performance goals, including achieving record earnings and comparisons of Nucors financial performance to peers in the steel industry and other companies. Stock-based compensation included in marketing, administrative and other expenses increased by 1% to $30.6 million in 2018 compared with $30.3 million in 2017 and includes costs associated with the vesting of stock awards granted in prior years. Also included in marketing, administrative and other expenses in 2018 is approximately $50 million in bonus costs related to the Company achieving record earnings that was distributed evenly among employees (none in 2017).  

Included in marketing, administrative and other expenses in 2018 was a $20.5 million benefit related to insurance recoveries. Included in marketing, administrative and other expenses in 2017 was a $22.5 million charge related to certain legal matters.   

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates  Equity method investment earnings were $40.2 million in 2018 and $41.7 million in 2017. The decrease in equity method investment earnings from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to increased costs at Nucor-JFE Steel Mexico, S de RL de C.V. (Nucor-JFE), a 50-50 joint venture with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan. Nucor-JFE is in the construction phase of building its galvanized sheet steel plant.   

Impairment of Assets  During the third quarter of 2018, Nucor performed an impairment analysis of its proved producing natural gas well assets due to the current and projected pricing environment at our sales point in the Piceance Basin at the time. After completing the impairment analysis, Nucor determined that the carrying amount exceeded its fair value and was other than temporary for certain of these assets. Nucor recorded a $110.0 million charge against these assets as a result. This charge was included in the raw materials segment. There were no impairment charges in 2017. See Note 7 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for additional information. Interest Expense (Income)  Net interest expense is detailed below (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 in part due to a benefit received from entering into and settling a treasury lock instrument in anticipation of the Companys debt issuance in the second quarter of 2018. The Company did not elect hedge accounting for this instrument. The average interest rate on debt decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017. Debt issued in the second quarter of 2018 included $500.0 million of 3.950% notes due 2028 and $500.0 million of 4.400% notes due 2048, which had lower interest rates than the $600.0 million of 5.750% notes that were repaid in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the $500.0 million of 5.850% notes that were repaid in the second quarter of 2018. Additionally, capitalized interest increased in 2018 as compared to 2017. Interest income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to increased average interest rates on investments.  

29   

Earnings Before Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interests  Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests by segment for 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The steel mills segments earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $3.50 billion was the greatest factor in making 2018 the most profitable year in Nucors history. Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests increased $1.55 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased average selling prices, volumes and metal margins. Strong economic growth, tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform the federal regulatory system strengthened the U.S. economy further in 2018 from the healthy levels experienced at the end of 2017. These factors were the primary driver of the steel mills segments performance in 2018. Additionally, the Section 232 steel tariffs provided another tailwind for the steel mills segment as the tariffs and the cumulative impact of the trade cases won by the domestic steel industry in recent years reduced unfairly traded imports into the U.S. market.  

The steel products segment reported record earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in 2018, driven by the strong performance of our tubular products businesses which were acquired in late 2016 and early 2017. Our deck, building systems and cold finish businesses also experienced increased profitability in 2018 as compared to 2017. Partially offsetting these increases in 2018 as compared to 2017 was the depressed results from our rebar fabrication operations which faced challenging market conditions in 2018.  

Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in the raw materials segment in 2018 increased significantly compared to 2017 due to the increased performance of our DRI facilities and DJJs scrap processing operations. DJJ had its most profitable year since the unprecedented raw materials market experienced in 2008. Included in the raw materials segments 2018 results was the total benefit of $48.1 million related to insurance recoveries received during the year and the $110.0 million impairment charge related to our proved producing natural gas well assets.  

The increase in losses in corporate/eliminations in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs, primarily profit sharing expense, as a result of our improved financial performance, and elimination of intercompany profit in inventory.  

Noncontrolling Interests  Noncontrolling interests represent the income attributable to the noncontrolling partners of Nucors joint ventures, primarily Nucor Yamato Steel Company (NYS), of which Nucor owns 51%. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2018 almost doubled compared to 2017 primarily due to the increased earnings of NYS. NYS had higher metal margins and volumes in 2018 as compared to 2017. Under the NYS limited partnership agreement, the minimum amount of cash to be distributed each year to the partners is the amount needed by each partner to pay applicable U.S. federal and state income taxes. In 2017, the amount of cash distributed to noncontrolling interest holders exceeded the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests based on mutual agreement of the general partners; however, the cumulative amount of cash distributed to partners was less than the cumulative net earnings of the partnership.  

Provision for Income Taxes  The effective tax rate in 2018 was 23.2% compared with 21.1% in 2017. The increase in rate between 2017 and 2018 was primarily due to the increase in the effective rate for state income taxes and the write-off of $21.3 million of deferred tax assets due to the change in the tax status of a subsidiary in 2018. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Act) decreased the federal income tax rate to 21% for 2018 (35% in 2017). The 2017 effective tax rate included a provisional net benefit of $175.2 million mainly driven by the revaluation of the Companys net U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the Tax Reform  

30   

 Act. In the third quarter of 2018, upon completion of its 2017 federal tax return, Nucor finalized the analysis of the previously estimated one-time transition tax. Nucor included a transition tax expense of $2.4 million in its 2018 financial results (provisionally none in 2017). An expense of $3.4 million was also recognized in 2018 related to the revaluation of temporary return to provision adjustments. Nucor has concluded U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2014. Tax years 2015 through 2017 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Canada Revenue Agency has concluded its examination of the 2012 and 2013 Canadian returns for Harris Steel Group Inc. and certain related affiliates. The 2015 tax year is currently under examination by the Canada Revenue Agency. In January 2019, the Trinidad and Tobago Inland Revenue Division initiated an audit of the Nu Iron Unlimited 2013 corporate income tax return. The tax years 2011 through 2017 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which Nucor is subject (primarily Canada and other state and local jurisdictions).  

Net Earnings and Return on Equity  Nucor reported net earnings of $2.36 billion, or $7.42 per diluted share, in 2018, compared to net earnings of $1.32 billion, or $4.10 per diluted share, in 2017. Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 9.4% and 6.5% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Return on average stockholders equity was 25.5% and 15.9% in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Comparison of 2017 to 2016  

Results of Operations  

Net Sales  Net sales to external customers by segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):   

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net sales for 2017 increased 25% from the prior year. Average sales price per ton increased 15% from $667 in 2016 to $764 in 2017. Total tons shipped to outside customers increased 9% from 24,309,000 tons in 2016 to 26,492,000 tons in 2017.  

In the steel mills segment, sales tons were as follows (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net sales for the steel mills segment increased 23% in 2017 from the prior year due to a 16% increase in the average sales price per ton from $581 in 2016 to $676 in 2017, as well as a 5% increase in total tons shipped to outside customers. All of our steel mill products experienced higher average selling prices in 2017 as compared to 2016. In addition, all product groups within the steel mills segment experienced an increase in tons sold to outside customers in 2017 as compared to the prior year.  

31   

Outside sales tonnage for the steel products segment was as follows (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net sales for the steel products segment increased 25% in 2017 from the prior year due to a 26% increase in total tons sold to outside customers and a 1% decrease in the average sales price per ton from $1,263 in 2016 to $1,252 in 2017. The increase in tons sold to outside customers in 2017 as compared to 2016 was largely due to the acquisitions of our tubular products businesses that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net sales for the steel products segment was also impacted by the higher volumes and average selling prices of our cold finish operations in 2017 as compared to 2016.  

Net sales for the raw materials segment increased 44% in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to significantly higher average selling prices in DJJs brokerage operations, and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes in DJJs brokerage operations and significantly increased volumes and higher average selling prices in DJJs scrap processing operations. Approximately 88% of outside sales in the raw materials segment in 2017 were from DJJs brokerage operations and approximately 10% of outside sales were from DJJs scrap processing operations (89% and 8%, respectively, in 2016).  

Gross Margins  In 2017, Nucor recorded gross margins of $2.57 billion (13%) compared to $2.03 billion (12%) in 2016:  

       

The primary driver for the increase in gross margin in 2017 as compared to 2016 was increased metal margins in the steel mills segment. Partially offsetting the increases in the steel mills segments average selling prices and volumes in 2017 as compared to 2016 was increased scrap and scrap substitute costs. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used in 2017 was $307, a 35% increase from $228 in 2016.  

       

Steel mill energy costs increased approximately $1 per ton in 2017 compared with 2016 due to higher unit costs for electricity and natural gas.  

       

In the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed an analysis of the impact the shift to value-added products had on steel mill capacity. As part of this analysis, we also revisited the impact that the shift in product mix had on our inventory costing. Based on this analysis, we changed our estimates of inventory cost based on the updated normal capacity determination and the related full absorption costing. The impact of the change in estimate resulted in a net pre-tax benefit of $77.6 million, $83.0 million of which affected gross margin, being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

       

Gross margins in the steel products segment for 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to the addition of our tubular products businesses. Our cold finish operations experienced increased profitability in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to both improved volumes and increased average selling prices. This improvement was partially offset by the highly competitive market and margin compression resulting from higher steel input costs, particularly at our rebar fabrication operations. Our rebar fabrication operations experienced significant declines in performance due to a combination of margin compression caused by higher steel input costs and delays on larger, more profitable projects.  

       

Gross margins related to DJJs brokerage and scrap processing operations improved during 2017 compared to 2016 due to the sustained impact of significant improvements in its cost structure established during 2016, combined with significant increases in average selling prices and increases in volume.  

       

Gross margins in the raw materials segment in 2017 benefited from the improved profitability of our DRI facilities. The primary driver of this improved profitability was our DRI facility in Trinidad, which more than offset the disappointing performance of our Louisiana DRI facility, which experienced unplanned outages during the first, third and fourth quarters of 2017.  

32   

Marketing, Administrative and Other Expenses  Profit sharing costs increased from 2016 to 2017. In 2017, profit sharing costs consisted of $169.4 million of contributions, including the Companys matching contribution, made to the Companys Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings Plan for qualified employees ($129.0 million in 2016). Stock-based compensation included in marketing, administrative and other expenses increased by 13% to $30.3 million in 2017 compared with $26.9 million in 2016, and includes costs associated with the vesting of stock awards granted in prior years. Also contributing to the increase in marketing, administrative and other costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 was increased non-operating expenses associated with unplanned outages at Nucor Steel Louisiana that occurred in 2017.  

Included in marketing, administrative and other expenses in 2017 was a $22.5 million charge related to certain legal matters. Included in marketing, administrative and other expenses in 2016 were charges related to legal settlements of $33.7 million and a net benefit of $11.1 million related to fair value adjustments to assets in the corporate/eliminations segment, the majority of which related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in a joint venture.  

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates  Equity method investment earnings were $41.7 million in 2017 and $38.8 million in 2016. The increase in equity method investment earnings from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to decreased losses at Duferdofin Nucor S.r.l. (Duferdofin Nucor) and Hunter Ridge Energy Services LLC (which was sold in 2016), partially offset by a decrease in earnings at NuMit LLC.  

Interest Expense (Income)  Net interest expense is detailed below (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates on our variable rate debt, as well as decreased capitalized interest, slightly offset by a decrease in our average debt outstanding due to the repayment of $600.0 million of 5.75% notes in December 2017. Interest income increased in 2017 due to higher average interest rates on investments, partially offset by significantly decreased average investment levels.  

Earnings Before Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interests  Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests by segment for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests for the steel mills segment for 2017 increased from 2016 primarily due to improved metal margins per ton at our sheet mills, particularly during the first half of the year. Also contributing to the improved earnings in 2017 compared to the prior year were improved metal margins at our plate mills. Earnings were negatively impacted  

33   

 in 2017 by challenging markets for our plate mills in the second half of the year, as well as challenging market conditions for the entire year for our beam, rebar and merchant bar products. Those four product groups combined to make up about half of our total steelmaking capacity in 2017.  

In the steel products segment, earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the addition of our tubular products businesses, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. Offsetting this increase, was margin compression resulting from higher steel input costs and highly competitive markets, particularly for our rebar fabrication operations. The performance of our joist, grating, rebar fabrication and building systems operations declined in 2017 from the prior year. Our steel products segment was negatively impacted by the still sluggish nonresidential construction market in 2017. The performance of our deck and cold finish operations improved compared to the prior year due to increased volumes and higher average selling prices in 2017.  

Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in the raw materials segment for 2017 improved significantly from 2016 due to the significantly increased profitability of DJJs brokerage and scrap processing operations and the profitable performance of our Trinidad DRI facility. Earnings in the raw materials segment were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned unplanned outages at Nucor Steel Louisiana during 2017.  

The increase in losses in corporate/eliminations in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs, primarily profit sharing expense, as a result of our improved financial performance.  

Noncontrolling Interests - The 41% decrease in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the decreased earnings of NYS, which was a result of decreased metal margin caused by increased scrap costs.  

Provision for Income Taxes - The effective tax rate in 2017 was 21.1% compared with 30.7% in 2016. The decrease in rate between 2016 and 2017 was primarily due to the provisional net tax benefit of $175.2 million the Company recorded in 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The revaluation of Nucors U.S. deferred tax liabilities and assets was the primary driver of the impact of the Tax Reform Act. This benefit was somewhat offset by the change in the relative proportions of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests to total pre-tax earnings between the periods.  

Net Earnings and Return on Equity  Nucor reported net earnings of $1.32 billion, or $4.10 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to net earnings of $796.3 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, in 2016. Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 6.5% and 4.9% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Return on average stockholders equity was 15.9% and 10.4% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Nucors cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments position remained strong at $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $991.1 million at the end of the previous year. Approximately $246.5 million and $248.3 million of the cash and cash equivalents position at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was held by our majority-owned joint ventures. Cash flows provided by operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity. When needed, we have external short-term financing sources available, including the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our bank credit facilities. We also issue long-term debt from time to time, as indicated by the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2018.  

Nucors $1.5 billion revolving credit facility is undrawn and was amended and restated in April 2018 to extend the maturity date to April 2023. We believe our financial strength is a key strategic advantage among domestic steel producers, particularly during recessionary business cycles. We carry the highest credit ratings of any steel producer headquartered in North America, with an A-long-term rating from Standard and Poors and a Baa1 long-term rating from Moodys. Our credit ratings are dependent,  

34   

 however, upon a number of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of our credit ratings is made in order to enhance investors understanding of our sources of liquidity and the impact of our credit ratings on our cost of funds. Based upon the preceding factors, we expect to continue to have adequate access to the capital markets at a reasonable cost of funds for liquidity purposes when needed.  

Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The current ratio was 3.1 at year-end 2018 compared with 2.4 at year-end 2017. The current ratio was positively impacted by a $0.4 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments from year-end 2017 due to the robust amount of cash generated by operations, as well as the $1.0 billion debt issuance in the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by capital expenditures, the repayment of $500.0 million of debt in the second quarter of 2018, acquisition of treasury stock and the payment of dividends. The current ratio was also positively impacted by a 32% increase in inventory and a 24% increase in accounts receivable from year-end 2017. Inventories increased from year-end 2017 due primarily to a 15% rise in the value of scrap and scrap substitutes per ton on hand and a 20% increase in the inventory tons on hand from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018. The increase in accounts receivable was due to a 21% increase in average sales price per ton and a 2% increase in outside shipments in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the prior year fourth quarter. Offsetting these increases were increases to accounts payable and salaries, wages and related accruals. Accounts payable increased 21% compared to year-end 2017 due primarily to the rise in the value of scrap and scrap substitutes per ton on hand and the increase in the inventory tons on hand previously mentioned. There was a 37% increase in salaries, wages and related accruals due to greater performance-based bonus accruals resulting from Nucors improved profitability in 2018 over the prior year.  

In 2018, total accounts receivable turned approximately every five weeks and inventories turned approximately every 10 weeks. These ratios compare with accounts receivable turnover of approximately every five weeks and inventory turnover of approximately every nine weeks in 2017.  

Funds provided by operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and new borrowings under existing credit facilities are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements for existing operations for at least the next 24 months.  

We have a simple capital structure with no off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated special purpose entities that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.  

Capital Allocation Strategy   

Nucors conservative financial practices have served us well in the past and are serving us well today. Nucors financial strength allows for a consistent, balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the business cycle. Nucors highest capital allocation priority is to invest for profitable long-term growth through our multi-pronged strategy of optimizing existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. Our second priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings growth. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong compared to growth investment opportunities. Nucors goal is to return a minimum of 40% of our earnings to shareholders, while maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating. In September 2018, Nucors Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock. The Board of Directors also terminated any previously authorized share repurchase programs. The Company repurchased $854.0 million of shares of its common stock in 2018 ($90.3 million in 2017 and $5.2 million in 2016). As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.5 billion remained available for share repurchases under the program.  

35   

Operating Activities  

Cash provided by operating activities was $2.39 billion in 2018, an increase of 127% compared with cash provided by operating activities of $1.06 billion in 2017. The primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operating activities was an 80% increase in net earnings over 2017. The funding of working capital increased in 2018 over the prior year due to the increase in inventory volumes and pricing, and accounts receivable from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018, both due to reasons previously mentioned. Slightly offsetting these increases was an increase in accounts payable due the change in scrap prices from year-end 2017 to year-end 2018 as compared to year-end 2016 to year-end 2017. Scrap prices increased more moderately between year-end 2017 and year-end 2018. More specifically, there was a 15% increase in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes in inventory from year-end 2017 through year-end 2018, as compared to a 27% increase in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes in inventory from year-end 2016 through year-end 2017. Another leading cause of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was the decrease in federal income taxes receivable, which is a function of Nucors increased profitability, the permanent lowering of the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for the years beginning after December 31, 2017 under the Tax Reform Act, the timing of federal tax payments, and the receipt of federal tax refunds. The decrease in cash used in salaries, wages and related accruals was mainly due to greater performance-based bonus accruals resulting from the Companys increased profitability during 2018 over the previous year. A significant item that partially offset the increase in earnings in 2018 compared to 2017 was the benefit related to deferred income taxes of $221.2 million in 2017 (expense related to deferred income taxes of $3.0 million in 2018) that was due in large part to the Tax Reform Act being enacted in late 2017.  

Investing Activities  

Our business is capital intensive; therefore, cash used in investing activities primarily represents capital expenditures for new facilities, the expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and the acquisition of other companies. Cash used in investing activities increased $111.2 million from 2017 to 2018. The primary driver for the increase in cash used in investing activities was that cash used for capital expenditures increased $534.0 million in 2018 from the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2018 included significant spending associated with the $230.0 million cold mill complex at Nucor Steel Arkansas and the $176.0 million hot band galvanizing line at Nucor Steel Gallatin, both of which are scheduled to start-up in 2019. Additionally, there was an increase in investments in affiliates in 2018 over 2017 related to an additional $70.7 million of investments in Nucor-JFE, as well as investments in other minor equity method investments. Partially offsetting the increase in cash used in investing activities was a $511.0 million decrease in cash used to fund acquisitions over the prior year. Significant acquisitions in 2017 included the purchases of Republic Conduit and Southland Tube, Inc. in January 2017 and St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc. in September 2017. Cash paid for acquisitions in 2018 totaled $33.1 million.  

Financing Activities  

Cash used in financing activities in 2018 was $908.2 million compared with cash used in financing activities of $1.24 billion in 2017. The majority of this change related to the issuance of $500.0 million of 3.950% notes due 2028 and $500.0 million of 4.400% notes due 2048 in the second quarter of 2018, offset by the repayment in the same quarter of $500.0 million of 5.850% notes due 2018. During 2017, we retired $600.0 million of long-term debt, in addition to the previously mentioned second quarter of 2018 retirement of $500.0 million of long-term debt. The interest rates on both of these retired debt tranches were at weighted-average interest rates that were higher than the weighted-average interest rates on the $1.0 billion of notes issued in April 2018. Additionally, the Company repurchased $854.0 million of shares of its common stock in 2018 compared with $90.3 million in 2017.  

Our credit facility includes only one financial covenant, which is a limit of 60% on the ratio of funded debt to total capitalization. In addition, the credit facility contains customary non-financial covenants, including a limit on Nucors ability to pledge the Companys assets and a limit on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Our funded debt to total capital ratio was 30% at the end of 2018 and 29% at the end of 2017, and we were in compliance with all other covenants under our credit facility at the end of 2018.  

Market Risk  

Nucors largest exposure to market risk is in our steel mills and steel products segments. Our utilization rates for the steel mills and steel products facilities for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 88% and 65%, respectively. A significant portion of our steel mills and steel products segments sales are into the commercial, industrial and municipal construction markets. Our largest single customer in 2018 represented approximately 5% of sales and consistently pays within terms. In the raw materials segment, we are exposed to price  

36   

 fluctuations related to the purchase of scrap steel and iron ore. Our exposure to market risk is mitigated by the fact that our steel mills use a significant portion of the products of this segment.  

Nucors tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds (IDRBs) have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. These IDRBs represented 24% of Nucors long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2018. The remaining 76% of Nucors long-term debt is at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. From time to time, Nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2018, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucors investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments.  

Nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to partially manage its exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process, as well as scrap, copper and aluminum purchased for resale to its customers. In addition, Nucor uses forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge cash flows associated with certain assets and liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated transactions. Nucor generally does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging the cash flows associated with specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed or sold in future periods and hedging the exposures related to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt instruments and foreign currency transactions. Nucor recognizes all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  

The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations.  

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 for the periods presented (in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  

Interest is estimated using applicable rates at December 31, 2018 for Nucors outstanding fixed-rate and variable-rate debt.  

 (2)  

Nucor enters into contracts for the purchase of scrap and scrap substitutes, iron ore, electricity, natural gas, and other raw materials and related services. These contracts include multi-year commitments and minimum annual purchase requirements and are valued at prices in effect on December 31, 2018, or according to the contract language. These contracts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such commitments will adversely affect our liquidity position.  

 (3)  

Purchase obligations include commitments for capital expenditures on operating machinery and equipment.  

 (4)  

Other long-term obligations include amounts associated with Nucors early-retiree medical benefits, management compensation and guarantees.  

 Note:  

In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $48.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $11.2 million at December 31, 2018.  

Dividends  

Nucor has increased its base cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973. Nucor paid dividends of $1.52 per share in 2018, compared with $1.51 per share in 2017. In November 2018, the Board of Directors increased the base quarterly dividend 5.3% to $0.40 per share. Over the past 10 years, Nucor has returned more than $5 billion in capital to its stockholders in the form of basic dividends, supplemental dividends and share repurchases. In February 2019, the Board of Directors declared Nucors 184th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share payable on May 10, 2019 to stockholders of record on March 29, 2019.  

37   

Outlook  

In 2019, we expect to continue to take advantage of our position of strength to grow Nucors long-term earnings power and stockholder value by continuing to successfully implement our five drivers to profitable growth strategy. Utilizing this strategy, we have invested significant capital, more than $9 billion, into our business since the last cyclical peak in 2008. We have done so over a broad range of strategic acquisitions and investments that we believe will further enhance our ability to grow Nucors long-term earnings power by increasing our channels to market, expanding our product portfolios into higher value-added offerings that are less vulnerable to imports, improving our highly variable low-cost structure and building upon our market leadership positions. We will utilize our strong liquidity position to seek investment opportunities to further grow our long-term earnings capacity.  

We are encouraged regarding anticipated full-year volume, pricing and profitability and believe our 2019 results will reflect another strong year with earnings performance among the best in Nucors history. Consumer confidence rose sharply late in 2016, continued on a more modest upward trajectory throughout 2017 and remained at historically high levels throughout 2018. The expansion in the nonresidential construction industry that has been underway for some time now, realized some deceleration beginning in 2016 and that trend continued into 2018. Nonresidential construction markets are expected to continue to grow at more moderate rates in 2019. Although units sold in the domestic automotive markets were consistent with 2017 at approximately 17.3 million vehicles sold, Nucors shipments to the industry grew by approximately 5% in 2018. We expect to grow our shipments to the industry again in 2019. In spite of an improved labor market and lower gasoline prices, vehicle sales are expected to decrease in 2019 but remain healthy. Should proposed infrastructure bills be enacted into law, this should benefit not just our steel mills segment but a number of our steel products businesses as well. Backlogs in both the steel mills and steel products segments were higher at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. As we begin 2019, we see improving market conditions in 20 of the 24 end-use markets that we participate in today with stable conditions in three of the remaining four markets. Scrap prices have decreased slightly in early 2019, a trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2018. We do not expect significant scrap price volatility over the next several months. We have made significant investments in our raw materials segment and will continue to utilize our unmatched global supply chain to optimize our raw material costs.  

We expect another strong quarter for earnings in the first quarter of 2019. Although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we anticipate this will be partially offset by expected increases in profitability of our bar mills and structural mills. The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses, which continue to be negatively impacted by declining average selling prices for raw materials that began in the fourth quarter of 2018. The profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect the first quarter of 2019 earnings to be much stronger than the first quarter of 2018.  

We are ever mindful of the threat of increases in imported steel stemming from the still significant excess foreign steel capacity. Finished steel imports as a percentage of U.S. steel demand are expected to decline from the estimated 27% in 2017 to 23% and 22% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Section 232 tariffs are having their intended impact by taking artificially low-cost foreign imports out of the U.S. market. Over the past decade, the steel industry won several important trade cases that addressed unfairly traded imports prior to the imposition of the Section 232 tariffs. The cumulative impact of those trade case victories also took a sizeable amount of unfairly traded imports out of the market, and those duties will remain in the event the Section 232 tariffs are lifted.  

We are committed to executing on the opportunities we see ahead to reward Nucor stockholders with very attractive long-term returns on their valuable capital invested in our Company. Our industry-leading financial strength allows us to support investments in our facilities that will enable us to generate increased profitability. In 2019, as we have in our past, we will allocate capital to investments that we believe will build our long-term earnings power. Capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately $1.8 billion in 2019. In 2018, Nucor announced approximately $1.0 billion of value enhancing investments to build new mills, expand production capacity at existing mills and advance our technological capabilities. In 2019, we have already announced another $1.3 billion investment to build a modern, state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. midwest.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables, the carrying value of non-current assets and reserves for environmental obligations and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accordingly, actual costs could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company records any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value as a charge to cost of products sold. Scrap and scrap substitute costs are a very significant component of the raw material, semi-finished and finished product inventory balances. The vast majority of the Companys inventory is recorded on a first-in, first-out method. Production costs are applied to semi-finished and finished product inventory from the approximate period in which they are produced.  

If steel selling prices were to decline in future quarters, write-downs of inventory could result. Specifically, the valuation of raw material inventories purchased during periods of peak market pricing would most likely be impacted. Low utilization rates at our steel mills or raw materials facilities could hinder our ability to work through high-priced scrap and scrap substitutes (particularly pig iron and iron ore), leading to period-end exposure when comparing carrying value to net realizable value.  

Long-Lived Asset Impairments  

We evaluate our property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment on an individual asset basis or at the lowest level asset grouping for which cash flows can be independently identified. Asset impairments are assessed whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets could exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows. In developing estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations, we utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce. When it is determined that an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to estimated fair market value.  

Certain long-lived asset groupings were tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2018. Undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping were estimated using managements long-range estimates of market conditions associated with each asset grouping over the estimated useful life of the principal asset within the group. Our undiscounted cash flow analysis indicated that those long-lived asset groupings were recoverable as of December 31, 2018; however, if our projected cash flows are not realized, either because of an extended recessionary period or other unforeseen events, impairment charges may be required in future periods. A 5% decrease in the projected cash flows of each of our asset groupings would not result in an impairment.  

39   

In September 2018, Nucor performed an impairment analysis of its proved producing natural gas well assets due to the current and projected natural gas pricing environment at our sales point in the Piceance Basin, which continued to deteriorate during 2018. Management had monitored these assets since the last impairment analysis was performed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the deterioration in the current and projected natural gas pricing and, in particular, the projected natural gas pricing at our sales point in the Piceance Basin reached such a level in the third quarter of 2018 that management determined that a triggering event had occurred. One of the main assumptions that most significantly affects the cash flow determination is managements estimate of future pricing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. The pricing used in this impairment assessment was developed by management based on projected natural gas market supply and demand dynamics, in conjunction with a review of projections by market analysts. The impairment analysis was performed on each of Nucors three groups (fields) of wells, with each field defined by common geographic location.  

Two of Nucors three fields of wells did not pass the undiscounted cash flow impairment analysis. An after-tax discounted cash flow analysis was performed for these two fields to determine the amount of impairment. The carrying values of these two fields were impaired by a combined $110.0 million. The impairment charge is included in impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018. The post-impairment combined carrying value of these two fields was $71.0 million at December 31, 2018. The third field was not impaired and had a carrying value of $51.8 million at December 31, 2018. Changes in the natural gas industry or a prolonged low price environment beyond what was assumed in this most recent analysis could cause management to revise the natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing assumptions, the estimated reserves or the estimated drilling production costs, all of which could result in future impairment of these proved well assets.  

Goodwill  

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value, including goodwill.  

When appropriate, Nucor performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For certain reporting units, it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. In these instances, a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of these reporting units. Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (i) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (ii) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (iii) a discount rate based on managements best estimate of the after-tax weighted-average cost of capital; and (iv) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence. Management considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. Those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate.  

Our fourth quarter 2018 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. Management does not believe that future impairment of these reporting units is probable. However, the performance of certain businesses that comprise our reporting units requires continued improvement. An increase of approximately 40 basis points in the discount rate, a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value, would not result in an impairment charge. See Note 8 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the results of the Companys 2018 annual goodwill impairment analysis.  

Nucor will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout 2019 in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing. Otherwise, all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual qualitative and/or quantitative impairment test during our fourth quarter of 2019. Changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Equity Method Investments  

Investments in joint ventures in which Nucor shares control over the financial and operating decisions but in which Nucor is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Each of the Companys equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if, and when, circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value below its carrying amount may have occurred. Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance or business prospects of the investee; missed financial projections; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, tax, economic or technological environment of the investee; a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates; and recurring negative cash flows from operations. When management considers the decline to be other than temporary, the Company would write down the related investment to its estimated fair market value. An other-than-temporary decline in carrying value is determined to have occurred when, in managements judgment, a decline in fair value below carrying value is of such length of time and/or severity that it is considered long-term.  

In the event that an impairment review is necessary, we calculate the estimated fair value of our equity method investments using a probability-weighted multiple-scenario income approach. Managements analysis includes three discounted cash flow scenarios (best case, base case and recessionary case), which contain forecasted near-term cash flows under each scenario. Generally, (i) the best case scenario contains estimates of future results ranging from slightly higher than recent operating performance to levels that are consistent with historical operating and financial performance (i.e., results experienced prior to the onset of the recessionary period that began in 2008); (ii) the base case scenario has estimates of future results ranging from generally in line with recent operating performance to levels that are more conservative than historical operating and financial performance; and (iii) the recessionary case scenario has estimates of future results which include limited growth resulting only from operational cost improvements and limited benefits of new higher-value product offerings. Management determines the probability that each cash flow scenario will come to fruition based on the specific facts and circumstances of each of the preceding scenarios, with the base case typically receiving the majority of the weighting.  

Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our equity method investments include: (i) expected cash flow for the six-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (ii) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the investment; (iii) a discount rate based on managements best estimate of the after-tax weighted-average cost of capital; and (iv) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence. While the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include projected revenues, metal margins and discount rate, the assumptions are often interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the estimated fair value. Management considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its investments are estimated. Those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate.  

Due to the protracted challenging steel market conditions in Europe, Nucor concluded that it was appropriate to assess its equity investment in Duferdofin Nucor for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2017. After completing its assessment, the Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount by a sufficient amount and that there was no need for an impairment charge. Management does not believe a triggering event has occurred since the assessment that was performed in 2017. The assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include projected cashflows and the discount rate. It is reasonably possible that material deviation of future performance from the estimates used in our most recent valuation could result in impairment of our investment in Duferdofin Nucor.  

Environmental Remediation  

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal, state and local authorities, and we make provisions for the estimated costs related to compliance. Undiscounted remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures. The accruals are reviewed periodically and, as investigations and remediation proceed, adjustments are made as we believe are necessary. Our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations and current technology.

Income Taxes  

We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations are recognized as a component of interest expense and other expenses.  

The staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. Reflected in our 2017 financial results, and in accordance with SAB 118, were certain provisional income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. Adjustments, as allowed for under SAB 118, to these provisional amounts were made in 2018. The accounting for the Tax Reform Act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Further information on the tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act is included in Note 19 to the Companys consolidated financial statements.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

See Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements adopted by Nucor during 2018 and the expected financial impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted.  

Reclassifications  

In the first quarter of 2018, we began reporting our tubular products and piling products businesses as part of the steel products segment. These businesses were previously included in the steel mills segment and were reclassified to the steel products segment as part of a realignment of Nucors reportable segments to reflect the way in which they are now viewed by management and how segment performance assessments will be made by the chief operating decision maker beginning in such period. As a result, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the prior periods presented.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Nucors management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Management assessed the effectiveness of Nucors internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013).  

Based on its assessment, management concluded that Nucors internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of Nucors internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 as stated in their report which is included herein.
