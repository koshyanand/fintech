Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Certain information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Company’s future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as “estimate”, “forecast”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes to or new interpretations of U.S. or international tax regulations; the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Company’s ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Company’s services, on the Company’s ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients’ premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Company’s ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Company’s reliance on short-term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the additional costs the Company will incur as a result of health care reform legislation may adversely affect the Company’s profit margins or the demand for the Company’s services; the possibility that the Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Executive Overview

 Demand for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad. Correspondingly, financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions. Annual net service revenues reached $5.80 billion in 2018, an increase of 10% from the prior year. Full-year 2018 net income increased to $434 million and diluted net income per share increased to $3.57. All three of the Company's reportable segments experienced revenue growth, led by risk consulting and internal audit services and permanent placement staffing, both of which increased 17% in 2018 on an as reported basis compared to last year.

We believe that the Company is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment. The United States economic backdrop during 2018 was conducive to growth for the Company as real gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew an estimated 2.6%, while the unemployment rate declined from 4.1% in December 2017 to 3.9% in December 2018. In the United States, the number of job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015, creating competition for skilled talent that increases the Company’s value to clients. The U.S. labor market remains robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. The number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all-time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resource plans with increasing frequency. 

Protiviti continues to see strong demand for its consulting and internal audit solutions. Financial services continues to be Protiviti's biggest industry sector. Protiviti has expanded its service offerings and continues to nurture and grow a loyal client base.

We monitor various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which we operate to anticipate demand for the Company’s services. We evaluate these trends to determine the appropriate level of investment, including personnel, which will best position the Company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environment. The Company’s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends. As such, during 2018, we added headcount in all of our lines of business compared to prior year-end levels.

We have limited visibility into future revenues not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic conditions noted above, but also because of the relatively short duration of the Company’s client engagements. Accordingly, we typically assess headcount and other investments on at least a quarterly basis. That said, based on current trends and conditions, we expect headcount levels for our full-time staff to be modestly higher for each of our reporting segments throughout the first quarter of 2019. 

Capital expenditures in 2018 totaled $43 million, approximately 41% of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure, both of which are important to the Company’s future growth opportunities. During 2018, we continued to invest in digital technology initiatives designed to enhance our service offerings to both clients and candidates. Capital expenditures also included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the Company’s leased offices. We currently expect that 2019 capitalized expenditures will range from $60 million to $70 million, of which $35 million to $45 million relates to software initiatives and technology infrastructure, including capitalized costs relating to the implementation of cloud computing arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

As described below, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments.

Revenue Recognition. Net service revenues as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations represent services rendered to customers less sales adjustments and allowances. Reimbursements, including those related to travel and out-of-pocket expenses, are also included in net service revenues, and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in direct costs of services. The Company records temporary and consultant staffing revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent in the presentation of revenues and expenses. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because the Company (i) has the risk of identifying and hiring qualified employees, (ii) has the discretion to select the employees and establish their price and duties and (iii) bears the risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers. 

Temporary and consultant staffing revenues are recognized when the services are rendered by the Company’s temporary employees. Permanent placement staffing revenues are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment. The Company has a substantial history of estimating the effect of permanent placement candidates who do not remain with its clients through the 90-day guarantee period. Allowances are established to estimate these losses. Risk consulting and internal audit services are generally provided on a time-and-material basis or fixed-fee basis. Revenues from time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements are recognized over time using a proportional performance method as hours are incurred relative to total estimated hours for the engagement. Contracts with multiple performance obligations are recognized as performance obligations are delivered, and contract value is allocated based on relative stand-alone selling values of the services and products in the arrangement. The Company periodically evaluates the need to provide for any losses on these projects, and losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred.

Income Taxes. The Company’s operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities and its provision for income taxes, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws that are applicable to its operations in various jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Company’s expected realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions.

On December 22, 2017, the President signed TCJA into law. Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, TCJA reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provided for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates of certain foreign earnings (a “transition tax”), and established new mechanisms to tax certain foreign earnings going forward. Similar to other large multinational companies, TCJA has wide ranging implications for the Company. 

In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allowed the Company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend 

14

beyond one year of the enactment date. The Company completed its TCJA analysis and recorded its final adjustments, which were not material, in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. Valuation allowances of $23.1 million and $20.2 million were recorded as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The valuation allowances recorded relate primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve. 

While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company.

Stock-based Compensation. Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock.

The Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the grant-date fair value for all stock-based payment awards that are expected to vest. This expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award, unless the awards are subject to performance conditions, in which case the Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche. The Company determines the grant-date fair value of its restricted stock and stock unit awards using the fair market value of its stock on the grant date, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case the Company utilizes a binomial-lattice model (i.e., Monte Carlo simulation model). The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to determine the stock-based compensation expense. 

No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the Company’s existing stock plans. The Company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006. 

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $45.0 million, $42.2 million and $42.7 million, respectively, of which $12.2 million, $11.4 million and $11.0 million was related to grants made in those respective years. Based on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2018, a one-percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.4 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note B—“New Accounting Pronouncements” to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II—Item 8 of this report.

Results of Operations

Demand for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad. Correspondingly, results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of material long-term contracts in any of the Company’s business units, future demand for the Company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty. We believe the Company is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment. 

The Company’s temporary and permanent staffing business has 324 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, while Protiviti has 62 offices in 23 states and 11 foreign countries.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The financial results of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts. 

15

Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, billing days, and certain intercompany adjustments. The Company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s reportable segments on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global, U.S. and international operations. The Company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the Company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days, constant currency exchange rates, and certain intercompany adjustments.

In order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates, as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period. Management then calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the Company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by the impact of certain intercompany adjustments, applicable comparative period revenues are reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. The term “as adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days, constant currency fluctuations, and certain intercompany adjustments are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the as adjusted revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein.

Refer to Item 7a. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 

Revenues. The Company’s revenues were $5.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 10.1% compared to $5.27 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenues from foreign operations represented 24% and 22% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2018, revenues for all three of the Company’s reportable segments were up compared to 2017. Revenue growth was strongest internationally, most notably within Europe. Permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services continued to post strong growth rates. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 

Temporary and consultant staffing revenues were $4.33 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 8.0% compared to revenues of $4.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Key drivers of temporary and consultant staffing revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the Company’s temporary employees on client engagements. On an as adjusted basis, temporary and consultant staffing revenues increased 7.9% for 2018, compared to 2017, due primarily to a 4.1% increase in average bill rates and an increase in the number of hours worked by the Company's temporary employees. In the U.S., 2018 revenues increased 5.8% on an as reported basis and 5.5% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2017. For the Company’s international operations, 2018 revenues increased 16.0% on an as reported basis and 17.0% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2017.

Permanent placement staffing revenues were $512 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 16.6% compared to revenues of $439 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Key drivers of permanent placement staffing revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement. On an as adjusted basis, permanent placement staffing revenues increased 16.0% for 2018 compared to 2017, driven by increases in number of placements and average fees earned per placement. In the U.S., 2018 revenues increased 16.4% on an as reported basis and 16.1% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2017. For the Company’s international operations, 2018 revenues increased 17.0% on an as reported basis, and increased 16.0% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2017. Historically, demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing and this is expected to continue.

16

Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $958 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 17.3% compared to revenues of $817 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Key drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates. On an as adjusted basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues increased 13.2% for 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by increases in billable hours and average hourly billing rates. In the U.S., 2018 revenues increased 12.0% on an as reported basis, or 11.8% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2017. For the Company’s international operations, 2018 revenues increased 42.1% on an as reported basis, or 19.2% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2017. The international year-over-year increases were primarily driven by strong revenue performance in Europe and Australia.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the as reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the year ended December 31, 2018, is presented in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross Margin. The Company’s gross margin dollars were $2.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 11.4% from $2.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.

Gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. The key drivers of gross margin are: i) pay/bill spreads, which represent the differential between wages paid to temporary employees and amounts billed to clients; ii) fringe costs, which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary and consultant staffing employees; and iii) conversion revenues, which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the Company’s client. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 9.1% from $1.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 37.6% in 2018, up from 37.2% in 2017. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher pay-bill spreads and conversion revenues.

Gross margin dollars for permanent placement staffing represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $511 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 16.6% from $438 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the increase in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the increase in revenues previously discussed.

Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, benefit costs and reimbursable expenses. The primary drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin are: i) the relative composition of and number of professional staff and 

17

their respective pay and bill rates; and ii) staff utilization, which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services staff. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were $269 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 16.2% from $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 28.1% in 2018, down from 28.4% in 2017. The decline in 2018 gross margin percentage compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in both pay rates for professional staff and headcount. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.82 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 10.6% from $1.65 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenues, the Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.4% for 2018, up from 31.3% for 2017. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 7.6% from $1.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing were 28.3% in 2018, down slightly from 28.4% in 2017. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 16.5% from $361 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 82.1% for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division were $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, increasing by 19.1% from $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 18.4% in 2018, up from 18.1% in 2017. For 2018 compared to 2017, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in variable overhead costs.

Operating Income. The Company’s total operating income was $589 million, or 10.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 13.9% from $517 million, or 9.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division, operating income was $405 million, or 9.3% of applicable revenues, up 13.8% from $356 million, or 8.9% of applicable revenues, in 2017. For the Company’s permanent placement staffing division, operating income was $91 million, or 17.7% of applicable revenues, up 16.9% from operating income of $77 million, or 17.7% of applicable revenues, in 2017. For the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division, operating income was $93 million, or 9.7% of applicable revenues, up 11.2% from operating income of $84 million, or 10.3% of applicable revenues, in 2017.

Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was 26.6% and 43.9% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The lower 2018 tax rate is primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a prior year $34 million one-time, non-cash charge to the provision for income taxes related to the enactment of TCJA. 

Years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016

Revenues. The Company’s revenues were $5.27 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by 0.3% compared to $5.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenues from foreign operations represented 22% and 20% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2017, revenues for permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services were up and revenues for temporary and consultant staffing were down slightly compared to 2016. Revenue growth was strongest internationally, most notably within Europe. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.

Temporary and consultant staffing revenues were $4.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, remained essentially flat compared to revenues of $4.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Key drivers of temporary and consultant staffing revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the Company’s temporary employees on client engagements. On an as adjusted basis, temporary and consultant staffing revenues decreased 0.3% for 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to fewer hours worked by the Company’s temporary employees, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in average bill rates. In the U.S., 2017 revenues decreased 3.1% on an as reported basis and 2.8% on an as 

18

adjusted basis, compared to 2016. For the Company’s international operations, 2017 revenues increased 11.0% on an as reported basis and 10.1% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2016.

Permanent placement staffing revenues were $439 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by 4.7% compared to revenues of $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Key drivers of permanent placement staffing revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement. On an as adjusted basis, permanent placement staffing revenues increased 4.9% for 2017 compared to 2016 due to increases in both the number of placements and average fees per placement. In the U.S., 2017 revenues increased 0.9% on an as reported basis and 1.3% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2016. For the Company’s international operations, 2017 revenues increased 14.1% on an as reported basis, and on an as adjusted basis increased 13.5%, compared to 2016. Historically, demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing and this is expected to continue.

Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $817 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by 1.5% compared to revenues of $804 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Key drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates. On an as adjusted basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues increased 1.9% for 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by increases in billable hours and billing rates. In the U.S., 2017 revenues remained essentially flat on an as reported basis, and increased 0.3% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2016. For the Company’s international operations, 2017 revenues increased 9.5% on an as reported basis, or 10.2% on an as adjusted basis, compared to 2016.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the as reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the year ended December 31, 2017, is presented in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross Margin. The Company’s gross margin dollars were $2.16 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.

Gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. The key drivers of gross margin are: i) pay/bill spreads, which represent the differential between wages paid to temporary employees and amounts billed to clients; ii) fringe costs, which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary and consultant staffing employees; and iii) conversion revenues, which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the Company’s client. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, down 1.1% from $1.51 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 37.2% in 2017, down from 37.5% in 2016. This year- over-year decline in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to higher workers’ compensation costs and other fringe benefit costs. The Company’s 2017 results include $0.9 million in workers’ compensation credits, pursuant to third-party 

19

actuarial reviews of the Company’s workers’ compensation accruals. This compares to a credit of $5.8 million in the year-ago period.

Gross margin dollars for permanent placement staffing represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $438 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 4.7% from $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the increase in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the increase in revenues previously discussed.

Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, benefit costs and reimbursable expenses.
