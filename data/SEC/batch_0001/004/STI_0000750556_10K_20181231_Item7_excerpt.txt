MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

INTRODUCTION

We are a leading provider of financial services, with our headquarters located in Atlanta, Georgia. We are an organization driven by our Company purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being — helping instill a sense of confidence in the financial circumstances of clients, communities, teammates, and owners is at the center of everything we do. Our principal subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers, businesses, corporations, institutions, and not-for-profit entities, both through branches (located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia) and through other digital and national delivery channels. In addition to deposit, credit, mortgage banking, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide capital markets, securities brokerage, investment banking, and wealth management services. We operate two business segments: Consumer and Wholesale, with functional activities included in Corporate Other. See Note 22, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a description of our business segments.

This MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as well as with the other information contained in this document. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” in this report, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

In this MD&A, consistent with SEC guidance in Industry Guide 3 that contemplates the calculation of tax-exempt income on a tax equivalent basis, we present net interest income, net interest margin, total revenue, and efficiency ratios on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments using a federal tax rate of 21% for all periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and 35% for all periods prior to January 1, 2018, as well as state income taxes, where applicable, to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. We believe the FTE basis is the preferred industry measurement basis for net interest income, net interest margin, total revenue, and efficiency ratios, and that it enhances comparability of net interest income and total revenue arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present other non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided in Table 29.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Recent Event 

On February 7, 2019, we announced that our Board approved a definitive agreement to combine with BB&T Corporation (“BB&T”) in an all-stock Merger. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), our shareholders will have the right to receive 1.295 shares of BB&T common stock for each share of our common stock. A new corporate headquarters for the combined company will be established in Charlotte, North Carolina, and it will operate under a new name and brand, while the combined company's board of directors and executive management team will be evenly split between SunTrust and BB&T. The Merger is expected to expand capabilities and accelerate capacity to invest in transformational technologies for clients, combine complementary business models to create a diverse and comprehensive business mix with leading market share positions, and deliver organizational and other merger-related synergies, while also being accretive to the combined company's profitability profile. Our Merger with BB&T is expected to close late in the third quarter of 2019 or in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of each company. For more information on our proposed Merger with BB&T, see Part I, Item 1, “Business,” and Note 25, “Subsequent Event,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Financial Performance

We delivered a seventh consecutive year of improved performance, efficiency, and capital returns for our owners, driven by a favorable operating environment, continued strong credit quality, and solid loan growth. We enjoyed solid revenue growth across both of our business segments, led by growth in net interest income. Diluted EPS for 2018 was $5.74, up 28% relative to 2017. For 2017, EPS included $0.39 per share in net benefits associated with actions we announced in our December 4, 2017 Form 8-K as well as the impact of the 2017 Tax Act and actions we took as a result to better position the Company for improved long-term success (“Form 8-K and tax reform-related items”).

Total revenue for 2018 increased 2% compared to 2017, as higher net interest income was partially offset by lower noninterest income. 

Net interest income increased 5% relative to 2017 due to net interest margin expansion and growth in average earning assets, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and associated funding costs. Net interest margin for 2018 increased 12 basis points, to 3.26%. The increase was driven by a 40 basis point increase in average earning asset yields arising from higher benchmark interest rates, favorable mix shift in earning assets, and lower premium amortization expense, offset partially by higher funding costs. Looking to the first quarter of 2019, we expect net interest margin to be generally stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2018; thereafter, net 

29

interest margin trends will depend on the interest rate environment, future levels of loan growth, and funding costs. 

Noninterest income decreased $128 million, or 4%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by lower mortgage and capital markets-related income as well as lower client transaction-related fees, offset partially by increases in other noninterest income, commercial real estate related income, and wealth management-related income. See additional discussion related to revenue, noninterest income, and net interest income and margin in the "Noninterest Income" and "Net Interest Income/Margin" sections of this MD&A. Also in this MD&A, see Table 21, "Net Interest Income Asset Sensitivity," for an analysis of potential changes in net interest income due to instantaneous moves in benchmark interest rates.

Noninterest expense decreased $91 million, or 2%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by the $111 million of net Form 8-K and tax reform-related items recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017, offset partially by higher outside processing and software expense and the $60 million pre-tax NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Looking to the first quarter of 2019, we expect core personnel expenses—which excludes the fourth quarter of 2018 NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge of $60 million—to increase by approximately $60 million to $75 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 due primarily to seasonal increases in 401(k) and FICA expenses. See additional discussion related to noninterest expense in the "Noninterest Expense" section of this MD&A.

For 2018, our efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios were 61.0% and 60.2%, compared to the prior year ratios of 63.1% and 62.3%, respectively. Our current year efficiency ratios were negatively impacted by the NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018; when excluding the impact of this item, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 59.6% for 2018, compared to 61.0% for 2017, which is the highest degree of improvement we have delivered since 2014. This strong efficiency progress enabled us to reach our target of below 60% one year earlier than our stated goal. We expect efficiency improvement to moderate in 2019, given our strong progress in 2018 and less anticipated macroeconomic tailwinds. Despite this, we continue to expect improvement and expense discipline as we work towards our medium-term target of between 56% and 58% for SunTrust when viewed as a stand-alone company. Upon consummation of the Merger, we expect our efficiency to improve significantly as we realize merger-related synergies. We remain focused on creating capacity to invest in technology and talent, which we believe will create the most long-term value for our clients and owners. See Table 29, "Selected Financial Data and Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures," in this MD&A for additional information regarding, and reconciliations of, our tangible and adjusted tangible efficiency ratios.

Overall asset quality remained very strong during 2018, evidenced by our 0.23% net charge-offs to total average LHFI ratio and 0.35% NPL to period-end LHFI ratio. In addition, our ALLL to period-end LHFI ratio (excluding loans measured at fair value) decreased 15 basis points compared to 2017 due primarily to improved economic and credit conditions. These low levels reflect the relative strength across our entire LHFI portfolio, though we recognize that there could be normalization 

moving forward. Looking to 2019, we expect to operate within a net charge-offs to total average LHFI ratio of between 25 and 30 basis points. Additionally, we expect the ALLL to period-end LHFI ratio to generally stabilize, which would result in a provision for loan losses that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, given loan growth. See additional discussion of our credit and asset quality, in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A.

Average LHFI grew 1% compared to 2017 as improved lending trends continued, driven by growth in consumer direct, nonguaranteed residential mortgages, CRE, consumer indirect, and guaranteed student loans. These increases were offset partially by declines in average home equity products, C&I, and commercial construction loans. Our consumer lending initiatives continue to produce solid loan growth through each of our major channels, while furthering the positive mix shift within the LHFI portfolio and improving our return profile. See additional loan discussions in the “Loans,” “Nonperforming Assets,” and "Net Interest Income/Margin" sections of this MD&A.

Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $219 million in 2018, relatively stable compared to 2017 as growth in time deposits and NOW accounts were offset largely by declines in money market accounts and noninterest-bearing deposits. Our clients continue to migrate from lower-cost deposits to CDs, largely due to higher rates and our targeted strategy that allows us to retain our existing depositors and capture new market share, while also managing our asset sensitivity profile. Rates paid on our interest-bearing consumer and commercial deposits increased 25 basis points compared to 2017 in response to rising benchmark interest rates, the move towards higher-cost deposits, and the pickup in lending activity. Looking forward to 2019, we expect deposit costs to continue to trend upwards, with the trajectory influenced by the interest rate environment and our loan growth. We remain focused on investing in products and capabilities that enhance the client experience, outside of rate paid. See additional discussion regarding average deposits in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" and "Deposits" sections of this MD&A.

Capital

Our capital ratios continue to be well above regulatory requirements. The CET1 ratio decreased to 9.21% at December 31, 2018, a 53 basis point decline compared to December 31, 2017, driven primarily by growth in risk weighted assets and higher share repurchases, offset partially by an increase in retained earnings. The Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios declined compared to December 31, 2017, due to the impact of our redemption of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2018 as well as the aforementioned impacts to our CET1 ratio. Our book value and tangible book value per common share both increased by 3% compared to December 31, 2017, driven by growth in retained earnings. See additional details related to our capital in Note 15, "Capital," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and in the “Capital Resources” section of this MD&A. Also see Table 29, "Selected Financial Data and Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures," in this MD&A for additional information regarding, and a reconciliation of, tangible book value per common share.

30

During the year, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 25%, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, which resulted in dividends for 2018 of $1.80 per common share, an increase from $1.32 per common share in 2017. We also repurchased $1.9 billion of our outstanding common stock during the year, which included $660 million under our 2017 capital plan and $1.25 billion in conjunction with the 2018 capital plan. In January 2019, we repurchased an additional $250 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2018 capital plan pursuant to an SEC Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan entered into on November 6, 2018. Given the aforementioned Merger announcement in February 2019, we do not intend to utilize our remaining share repurchase capacity of $500 million under the 2018 capital plan. See the “Recent Event” section above for more on the Merger announcement. For additional details related to our capital actions and share repurchases, refer to the “Capital Resources” section of this MD&A and Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K.

Business Segments Highlights

Consumer

Our investments across Consumer Lending, together with our strategic partnerships, have collectively improved our growth, returns, and the diversity of our portfolio. Enhanced marketing and analytics, new product offerings, and increased referrals have been key contributors to our growth in LightStream and direct consumer lending, including point-of-sale digital financing. 

Net interest income increased $329 million, or 8%, compared to 2017, as a result of continued loan growth and improved deposit spreads. Noninterest income decreased $101 million, or 5%, compared to 2017, due primarily to lower mortgage-related income as a result of lower refinance volume and lower gain on sale margins. The decline in noninterest income was offset slightly by wealth management-related income where we are observing positive underlying trends, including a $4.2 billion increase in new production assets under management during 2018.

The average balance of our LHFI portfolio increased $1.8 billion, or 3%, compared to 2017. We continue to deliver high quality loan growth, reflecting our consistent underwriting discipline and conservative risk posture. This is evidenced by our new production FICOs within consumer lending, which averaged 766 in 2018, stable compared to 2017.

Our loan growth during 2018 was funded entirely with deposit growth. Our targeted focus on CDs attracted both new clients and existing clients and generated approximately $2.8 billion in average CD growth compared to 2017.

We delivered strong operating leverage in 2018, resulting in 200 basis points in efficiency improvement. Our efficiency ratio was 66.5% for 2018, compared to 68.5% for 2017. The decrease was due primarily to improved revenues combined with our ongoing expense discipline which allowed us to make significant progress towards our medium term objectives. This improvement was driven by a number of actions including organizational restructuring, increased automation, and increased digital adoption. We have also made significant strides in improving the client experience, driven largely by our investments in technology. During 2018, we introduced a fully 

digital mortgage application, SmartGUIDE, which streamlines our underwriting process. For our private wealth clients, we introduced a new digital client portal to provide them with enhanced financial planning tools and a holistic view of their financial position. These investments, combined with our talented team, played a significant role in the national recognition we received in 2018 for differentiated client experience. 

We completed the merger of our STM and Bank legal entities in the third quarter of 2018. This merger simplified our organizational structure, enabled operational efficiencies, and allowed us to more fully serve the needs of our clients irrespective of whether they began their SunTrust relationship with a mortgage or another lending or deposit product. Subsequent to the merger, mortgage operations have continued under the Bank’s charter. See Note 22, “Business Segment Reporting,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

Wholesale 

Our advice-driven, middle-market strategy within the Wholesale segment continues to drive good results. We achieved record revenue and net income in 2018, buoyed by strong net interest income and continued expense discipline. The quality of our people, the advice they deliver, and the way we work together have enabled us to meet more client needs and provide superior execution in varying market conditions. 

Net interest income increased $99 million, or 5%, compared to 2017, as a result of net interest margin expansion and loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $39 million, or 2%, compared to 2017, due primarily to a decrease in loan syndications, which is a reflection of both market conditions and the impact of competition from non-bank lenders. Notwithstanding these declines, the underlying momentum in our capital markets business is strong, with mergers and acquisition and equity-related income up 14% and capital market fees from Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, and PWM clients up 49% year-to-date. We are highly encouraged by our progress and believe we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this space, given our full set of capabilities and OneTeam approach. In addition, we also had a particularly good year in structured real estate as a result of our strong client relationships and structuring expertise.

The average balance of our LHFI portfolio increased $806 million, or 1%, compared to 2017, due primarily to improved lending trends compared to 2017. Our loan growth in C&I during the second half of 2018 was driven by mergers and acquisitions, increased revolver utilization, and investments made in expanding our industry penetration and geographical reach, evidenced by the announcement of our new Houston commercial office in November 2018. Our loan growth in Commercial Real Estate resulted from investments made in new lending capabilities. During 2017, we added permanent and bridge financing capabilities which helped to offset the runoff in the construction portfolio and afforded us the opportunity to participate in the full life cycle of an asset.

We remain focused on investing in technology to arm our teammates with the tools they need to maximize effectiveness and to improve the experience for our clients, particularly in Treasury & Payment Solutions. During 2018, we transitioned to SunView, our new treasury and payments platform, and we are 

31

now focused on expanding SunView to a broader Wholesale client portal.

Overall, despite challenging market conditions, our pipelines are strong and we believe we are well positioned to meet our clients' needs. As we continue to see the benefits of our differentiated business model, we are pleased with the progress made and will continue to execute our advice-driven strategy. 

Additional information related to our business segments can be found in Note 22, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and further discussion of our business segment results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 can be found in the "Business Segment Results" section of this MD&A.

1 Interest income includes loan fees of $166 million, $177 million, and $165 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

2 Income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis.

3 Beginning January 1, 2018, we began presenting equity securities previously presented in securities AFS (taxable) as other earning assets. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation for comparability.  

4 Derivative instruments employed to manage our interest rate sensitivity decreased net interest income $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and increased net interest income $104 million and $261 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

5 See Table 29, “Selected Financial Data and Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures,” in this MD&A for additional information and reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP performance measures. Approximately 95% of the total FTE adjustment for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was attributed to C&I loans.

6 Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average total earning assets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate, while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. The rate/volume change, change in rate times change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of their total.

2 Beginning January 1, 2018, we began presenting equity securities previously presented in securities available for sale (taxable) as other earning assets. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation for comparability.

34

NET INTEREST INCOME/MARGIN (FTE)

Net interest income was $6.1 billion in 2018, an increase of $297 million, or 5%, compared to 2017. Net interest margin for 2018 increased 12 basis points, to 3.26%, compared to 2017. The increase was driven by a 40 basis point increase in average earning asset yields as a result of higher benchmark interest rates, favorable mix shift, and lower premium amortization expense. Specifically, average LHFI yields increased 43 basis points, driven by broad-based increases in yields across most loan categories, while yields on securities AFS increased 22 basis points. These increases were offset partially by higher funding costs.

Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 33 basis points compared to 2017, driven by increases in rates paid across all interest-bearing liability categories. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 26 basis points. 

Looking to the first quarter of 2019, we expect net interest margin to be generally stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2018; thereafter, net interest margin trends will depend on the interest rate environment, future levels of loan growth, and funding costs.

Average earning assets increased $1.9 billion, or 1%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by a $1.5 billion, or 1%, increase in average LHFI and a $1.1 billion, or 4%, increase in average securities AFS, offset partially by a $433 million, or 17%, decrease in average LHFS and a $377 million, or 7%, decrease in average interest earning trading assets. See the “Loans” section in this MD&A for additional discussion regarding loan activity.

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.7 billion, or 3%, compared to 2017, due primarily to increases across most consumer and commercial deposit categories as well as average long-term debt, offset largely by declines in money market accounts and foreign deposits. Average interest-bearing consumer and commercial deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 1%, due primarily to growth in average time deposits and NOW accounts in response to our targeted focus on CDs. The continued movement from lower cost deposits to CDs allows us to retain our existing depositors and capture new market share, while also managing our asset sensitivity profile, and we expect this trend to continue as interest rates rise. 

Average long-term debt increased $1.4 billion, or 13%, compared to 2017, due primarily to loan growth exceeding deposit growth. See the “Borrowings” section of this MD&A for additional information regarding our short-term borrowings and long-term debt.

We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. These instruments are primarily receive-fixed, pay-variable swaps that synthetically convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding notional balance of active swaps that qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans was $10.3 billion, compared to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2017, respectively.

In addition to the income recognized from active swaps, we recognize interest income or expense from terminated swaps that were previously designated as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans. Interest expense from our commercial loan swaps was $72 million in 2018, compared to interest income of $89 million in 2017 due primarily to an increase in LIBOR. As we manage our interest rate risk we may continue to purchase additional and/or terminate existing interest rate swaps.

Remaining swaps on commercial loans have maturities through 2023 and have an average maturity of 2.5 years at December 31, 2018. The weighted average rate on the receive-fixed rate leg of the commercial loan swap portfolio was 1.72%, and the weighted average rate on the pay-variable leg was 2.50%, at December 31, 2018.

Foregone Interest

Foregone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by two basis points and less than one basis point for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See additional discussion regarding our credit quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A. In addition, Table 1 and Table 2 in this MD&A contain more detailed information regarding average balances, yields earned, rates paid, and associated impacts on net interest income.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Beginning July 1, 2018, we began presenting bridge commitment fee income related to capital market transactions in Investment banking income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For periods prior to July 1, 2018, this income was previously presented in Other charges and fees and has been reclassified to Investment banking income for comparability. Capital market bridge fee income totaled $14 million, $24 million, and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

2 Beginning with this Form 10-K, we began presenting Mortgage production related income and Mortgage servicing related income as a single line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income titled Mortgage related income. Prior periods have been conformed to this updated presentation for comparability.

Noninterest income decreased $128 million, or 4%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by lower mortgage and capital markets-related income as well as lower client transaction-related fees, offset partially by increases in other noninterest income, commercial real estate related income, and wealth management-related income. 

Client transaction-related fee income, which includes service charges on deposit accounts, other charges and fees, and card fees, decreased $49 million, or 4%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by the impact of our January 1, 2018 adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard, which resulted in the netting of certain expense items against this income, as well as by a change in our process for recognizing card rewards expenses in the third quarter of 2018. The revenue recognition accounting standard decreased client transaction-related fee income by $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our adoption of this accounting standard.

Investment banking income decreased $24 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. This decrease was due primarily to decreased activity in loan syndications, leveraged finance, and investment grade bond originations. These decreases were offset partially by strong deal flow activity in mergers and acquisitions and equity offerings, as well as by our adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard, which increased investment banking income by $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Trading income decreased $28 million, or 15%, compared to 2017. This decrease was due primarily to lower fixed income sales and trading revenue.

Mortgage related income decreased $80 million, or 19%, compared to 2017 driven by a $77 million, or 33%, decrease in mortgage production related income. The decrease in mortgage production related income was driven primarily by lower gain on sale margins, reduced refinance activity, and less favorable channel mix, offset partially by a repurchase reserve release during the fourth quarter of 2018. Mortgage application and closed loan volume both decreased 8% compared to 2017. The UPB of mortgage loans in the servicing portfolio was $171.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $165.5 billion at December 31, 2017.

Retail investment services income increased $14 million, or 5%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by growth in assets under management.

Commercial real estate related income increased $11 million, or 9%, compared to 2017. This increase was due primarily to increased structured real estate revenue and higher tax credit-related income from our investments in affordable housing partnerships, offset partially by a decline in transactional activity in our agency lending business.

Net securities gains totaled $1 million compared to net securities losses of $108 million in 2017. Net securities losses for 2017 were driven by $109 million of securities AFS portfolio restructuring losses. 

Gain on sale of subsidiaries totaled $107 million for 2017, resulting from our gain from the sale of PAC during the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 3, "Acquisitions/Dispositions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the sale of PAC.

Other noninterest income increased $31 million, or 30%, compared to 2017. This increase was due primarily to $30 million of remeasurement gains on an equity investment following our full adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial 

36

assets accounting standard on January 1, 2018, as well as mark-to-market gains on our CDS hedge portfolio. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our adoption of this accounting standard.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest expense decreased $91 million, or 2%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by the $111 million of net Form 8-K and tax reform-related items recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017, offset partially by higher outside processing and software expense, personnel expenses, and increased operating losses.

Personnel expenses increased $51 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. This increase was due primarily to the $60 million pre-tax NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Looking to the first quarter of 2019, we expect core personnel expenses—which excludes the fourth quarter of 2018 NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge of $60 million—to increase by approximately $60 million to $75 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 due primarily to seasonal increases in 401(k) and FICA expenses.

Outside processing and software expense increased $83 million, or 10%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by higher software-related costs resulting from the implementation and amortization of new and upgraded technology assets.

Net occupancy expense decreased $5 million, or 1%, compared to 2017, driven by lease termination gains recognized in the second and third quarters of 2018. Separately, we adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, on January 1, 2019, which resulted in the remaining deferred gain on sale-leaseback transactions being recognized in retained earnings through a cumulative effect adjustment. Accordingly, this line item will no longer include amortization of deferred gains subsequent to 2018. Amortization of deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions recognized in 

Net occupancy expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled $6 million, $17 million, and $43 million, respectively. See Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

Marketing and customer development expense decreased $57 million, or 25%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by the $50 million tax reform-related charitable contribution in the fourth quarter of 2017 to support financial well-being initiatives. 

Regulatory assessments expense decreased $61 million, or 33%, compared to 2017, driven by lower FDIC insurance premiums, cessation of the FDIC surcharge, and a $9 million regulatory assessment credit in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Operating losses increased $39 million, or 98%, compared to 2017, due primarily to the favorable resolution of several legal matters in 2017.

Consulting and legal fees decreased $9 million, or 13%, compared to 2017, due to the resolution of prior legal matters.

Other staff expense decreased $69 million, or 57%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by higher severance costs recognized during 2017, largely in connection with the voluntary early retirement program announced in our December 4, 2017 Form 8-K (as part of our net charge related to efficiency actions).

Other noninterest expense decreased $63 million, or 15%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by lower branch and corporate real estate closure costs and lower software writedowns in 2018.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes and interest. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the provision for income taxes was $548 million, representing an effective tax rate of 16%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was $532 million, representing an effective tax rate of 19%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.

We recorded an income tax benefit for the remeasurement of our December 31, 2017 DTAs and DTLs and other tax reform-related items of $55 million and $303 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This $55 million adjustment completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act.

See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information related to the provision for income taxes. 

LOANS

Our disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the related credit reserves (i) describe the nature of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio, (ii) provide information on how we analyze and assess credit risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate ALLL, and (iii) explain changes in the ALLL as well as reasons for those changes.

Our loan portfolio consists of two loan segments: Commercial loans and Consumer loans. Loans are assigned to these segments based on the type of borrower, purpose, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, we further disaggregate each loan segment into loan types based on common characteristics within each loan segment.

Commercial Loans

C&I loans include loans to fund business operations or activities, loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards, and other wholesale lending activities. Commercial loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as C&I loans because the primary source of loan repayment for these properties is business income and not real estate operations. CRE and Commercial construction loans include investor loans where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate.

Consumer Loans

Residential mortgages, both guaranteed (by a federal agency or GSE) and nonguaranteed, consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes; mostly prime, first-lien loans. Residential home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans secured by residential real estate that may be in either a first lien or junior lien position. Residential construction loans include residential real estate secured owner-occupied construction-to-perm loans and lot loans. 

Consumer loans also include Guaranteed student loans, Indirect loans (consisting of loans secured by automobiles, boats, and recreational vehicles), Other direct loans (consisting primarily of unsecured loans, direct auto loans, loans secured by negotiable collateral, and private student loans), and Credit cards.

The composition of our loan portfolio is presented in Table 5:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Includes $4.1 billion, $3.7 billion, $3.7 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.6 billion of lease financing and $796 million, $778 million, $729 million, $672 million, and $687 million of installment loans at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

2 Includes $163 million, $196 million, $222 million, $257 million, and $272 million of LHFI measured at fair value at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

3 Includes $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion, $3.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.9 billion of LHFS measured at fair value at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loans Held for Investment

LHFI totaled $151.8 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $8.7 billion from December 31, 2017, driven largely by increases in C&I, CRE, consumer direct, nonguaranteed residential mortgages, guaranteed student, and consumer indirect loans, offset partially by decreases in commercial construction loans and residential home equity products.

Average LHFI for 2018 totaled $145.7 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 1%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by increases in consumer direct, nonguaranteed residential mortgages, CRE, guaranteed student, and consumer indirect loans. These increases were offset partially by declines in average home equity products, C&I, and commercial construction loans. See Table 1 and the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section in this MD&A for more detailed information regarding average LHFI balances, yields earned, and associated impacts on net interest income.

Commercial loans increased $5.5 billion, or 7%, during 2018, driven by a $4.8 billion, or 7%, increase in C&I loans resulting from growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments. CRE loans also increased $1.9 billion, or 37%, driven by increased production across a diverse array of property types as a result of investments we have made in new lending 

capabilities. These increases were offset partially by a $1.3 billion, or 33%, decrease in commercial construction loans due primarily to payoffs and paydowns.

Consumer loans increased $3.2 billion, or 5%, during 2018, driven by a $1.9 billion, or 22%, increase in other direct, a $1.7 billion, or 6%, increase in nonguaranteed residential mortgages, a $596 million, or 9%, increase in guaranteed student loans, and a $279 million, or 2%, increase in indirect loans. These increases were offset partially by a $1.2 billion, or 11%, decrease in residential home equity products.

At December 31, 2018, 40% of our residential home equity product balance was in a first lien position and 60% was in a junior lien position. For residential home equity products in a junior lien position at December 31, 2018, we own or service 32% of the balance of loans that are senior to the home equity product.

Loans Held for Sale

LHFS decreased $822 million, or 36%, during 2018, due primarily to loan sales exceeding mortgage production.

41

Asset Quality

Our asset quality metrics were strong during 2018, evidenced by our low net charge-offs to total average LHFI ratio and low NPLs to period-end LHFI ratio. These low levels reflect the relative strength across our LHFI portfolio, particularly in C&I, CRE, residential mortgages, and home equity products, though we recognize that there could be normalization and variability moving forward. See the “Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A for detailed information regarding our net charge-offs and NPLs.

NPAs decreased $152 million, or 21%, during 2018, driven by charge-offs, paydowns, and the return to accrual status of certain C&I NPLs and nonperforming home equity products. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the ratio of NPLs to period-end LHFI was 0.35% and 0.47%, respectively.

Early stage delinquencies were 0.73% and 0.80% of total loans at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 

respectively. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were 0.27% and 0.32% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The reductions in early stage delinquencies resulted primarily from improvements in consumer loans.

For 2018 and 2017, net charge-offs totaled $338 million and $367 million, and the net charge-offs to total average LHFI ratio was 0.23% and 0.25%, respectively. The decline in net charge-offs compared to 2017 was driven primarily by overall asset quality improvements and lower commercial net charge-offs.

Looking to 2019, we expect to operate within a net charge-offs to total average LHFI ratio of between 25 and 30 basis points. Additionally, we expect the ALLL to period-end LHFI ratio to generally stabilize, which would result in a provision for loan losses that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, given loan growth.

42

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The allowance for credit losses consists of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses and summarized credit loss experience is shown in Table 9. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 8, "Allowance for Credit 

Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K as well as the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of this MD&A for further information regarding our ALLL accounting policy, determination, and allocation. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Related to loans disposed in connection with the sale of PAC. For additional information regarding the sale of PAC, see Note 3, “Acquisitions/Dispositions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

2 The unfunded commitments reserve is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

3 $163 million, $196 million, $222 million, $257 million, and $272 million of LHFI measured at fair value at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were excluded from period-end LHFI in the calculation, as no allowance is recorded for loans measured at fair value. We believe that this presentation more appropriately reflects the relationship between the ALLL and loans that attract an allowance.

4 $5 million, $4 million, $3 million, $3 million, and $3 million of NPLs measured at fair value at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were excluded from NPLs in the calculation, as no allowance is recorded for NPLs measured at fair value. We believe that this presentation more appropriately reflects the relationship between the ALLL and NPLs that attract an allowance.

43

Provision for Credit Losses

The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses and the (benefit)/provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. For 2018, the total provision for loan losses decreased $179 million compared to 2017, driven primarily by lower hurricane-related reserves and net charge-offs as well as improved economic and credit conditions resulting in a lower ALLL.

Our quarterly review processes to determine the level of reserves and provision are informed by trends in our LHFI 

portfolio (including historical loss experience, expected loss calculations, delinquencies, performing status, size and composition of the loan portfolio, and concentrations within the portfolio) combined with a view on economic conditions. In addition to internal credit quality metrics, the ALLL estimate is impacted by other indicators of credit risk associated with the portfolio, such as geopolitical and economic risks, and the increasing availability of credit and resultant higher levels of leverage for consumers and commercial borrowers.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The ALLL decreased $120 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2017, to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of reserves held for hurricane-related losses and improved economic and credit conditions, offset partially by loan growth. The ALLL to period-end LHFI ratio (excluding loans measured at fair value) 

decreased 15 basis points from December 31, 2017, to 1.06% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs (excluding NPLs measured at fair value) increased to 3.10x at December 31, 2018, compared to 2.59x at December 31, 2017, due to a decrease in NPLs, offset partially by a decrease in the ALLL. 

44

NONPERFORMING ASSETS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual loans/NPLs.

2 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the property is conveyed and the funds are received. The receivable related to proceeds due from the FHA and the VA totaled $50 million, $45 million, $50 million, $52 million, and $57 million at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses, such as nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, and TDR loans, are disclosed in the NPA table above. Loans with known potential credit problems that may not otherwise be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans, which are disclosed along with additional credit quality information in Note 7, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no known significant potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed. See the "Critical Accounting Policies" MD&A section of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our policy on loans classified as nonaccrual.

NPAs decreased $152 million, or 21%, during 2018. The decrease in NPAs was driven primarily by a decrease in commercial NPLs and the return to accrual status of certain nonperforming home equity products.

Nonperforming Loans

NPLs at December 31, 2018 totaled $526 million, a decrease of $148 million, or 22%, from December 31, 2017, driven primarily by decreases in C&I, CRE, and home equity NPLs. The ratio of NPLs to period-end LHFI was 0.35% and 0.47% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Commercial NPLs decreased $81 million, or 34%, during 2018 driven by decreases in C&I and CRE NPLs of $58 million, or 27%, and $22 million, or 92%, respectively. These decreases were due primarily to charge-offs, paydowns, and the return to accrual status of certain C&I NPLs.

Consumer NPLs decreased $67 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2017, driven by the return to accrual status of certain home equity products. 

Interest income on consumer nonaccrual loans, if received, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not generally recognized until after the principal amount has been reduced to zero. Interest income 

45

recognized on nonaccrual loans (which includes out-of-period interest for certain commercial nonaccrual loans) totaled $19 million and $32 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $45 million and $43 million would have been recognized during 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Other Nonperforming Assets

OREO decreased $3 million, or 5%, during 2018 to $54 million at December 31, 2018. Sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $63 million and $60 million during 2018 and 2017, resulting in net gains of $9 million and $10 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves.

Most of our OREO properties are located in Florida, Maryland, Georgia, and South Carolina. Residential and commercial real estate properties comprised 92% and 4%, respectively, of total OREO at December 31, 2018, with the remainder related to land. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were re-evaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in property values could result in additional losses as they are regularly revalued. See the "Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements" section within Note 20, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are recorded in Other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy. We are actively managing and disposing of these assets to minimize future losses and to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are included in LHFI and LHFS, and totaled $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of these, 97% and 98% were government-guaranteed at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accruing LHFI past due 90 days or more increased $247 million, or 18%, during 2018, driven by a $280 million, or 27%, increase in guaranteed student loans, offset partially by a $51 million, or 15%, decrease in guaranteed residential mortgages.

Restructured Loans

To maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification is appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform an in-depth and ongoing programmatic review of a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. 

Based on our review of the aforementioned factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The restructuring methods offered to our clients primarily include an extension of the loan's contractual term and/or a reduction in the loan's original contractual interest rate. In limited circumstances, loan modifications that forgive contractually specified unpaid principal balances may also be offered. For residential home equity lines nearing the end of their draw period and for commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is an extension of the loan's contractual term.

Loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower financial difficulties are reported as TDRs. Accruing loans may retain accruing status at the time of restructure and the status is determined by, among other things, the nature of the restructure, the borrower's repayment history, and the borrower's repayment capacity.

Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a sustainable history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms, typically six months, are usually reclassified to accruing TDR status. Generally, once a loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life, even after returning to accruing status (unless the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were available in the market at the time of the modification, or if the loan is subsequently remodified at market rates). Some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses are factored into our ALLL estimate. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions.

At December 31, 2018, our total TDR portfolio totaled $2.6 billion and was comprised of $2.5 billion, or 95%, of consumer loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit) and $133 million, or 5%, of commercial loans. Total TDRs decreased $124 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2017, as a $129 million, or 5%, decrease in accruing TDRs was offset partially by a $5 million, or 2%, increase in nonaccruing TDRs.

Generally, interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such recognized interest income totaled $108 million for both 2018 and 2017. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $127 million and $130 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, would have been recognized.

For additional information regarding our restructured loans and associated accounting policies, see Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 7, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K as well as the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.

SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

The following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For a complete discussion of our financial instruments measured at fair value and the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments, see Note 20, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Trading Assets and Liabilities and Derivative Instruments

Trading assets and derivative instruments increased $413 million, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2017. This increase was due primarily to increases in trading loans, agency MBS, U.S. Treasury securities, CP, and corporate and other debt securities, offset partially by decreases in federal agency securities and derivative instruments. These changes were driven 

by normal activity in the trading portfolio product mix as we manage our business and continue to meet our clients' needs. Trading liabilities and derivative instruments increased $321 million, or 25%, compared to December 31, 2017, driven by increases in U.S. Treasury securities and corporate and other debt securities. For composition and valuation assumptions related to our trading products, as well as additional information on our derivative instruments, see Note 5, “Trading Assets and Liabilities and Derivative Instruments,” Note 19, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” and the “Trading Assets and Derivative Instruments and Investment Securities” section of Note 20, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

The investment securities portfolio is managed as part of our overall liquidity management and ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality, liquid portfolio, while managing our interest rate risk profile. The amortized cost of the portfolio increased $997 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased holdings of agency commercial and residential MBS as well as non-agency commercial MBS, offset partially by decreased holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, non-agency residential MBS, and federal agency securities. The fair value of the securities AFS portfolio increased $495 million compared to December 31, 2017, due primarily to the aforementioned increases in securities holdings, offset largely by a $502 million increase in net unrealized losses associated with increased market interest rates. At December 31, 2018, the overall securities AFS portfolio was in a $468 million net unrealized loss position, compared to a net unrealized gain position of $34 million at December 31, 2017. The securities AFS portfolio had an effective duration of 4.6 years at December 31, 2018 compared to 4.5 years at December 31, 2017.

Net realized gains on the sale of securities AFS were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2016, while net realized losses on the sale of securities AFS for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled 

$108 million due to the fourth quarter of 2017 portfolio restructuring. There were no OTTI credit losses recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 or the year ended December 31, 2016, and OTTI credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were immaterial. For additional information on our accounting policies, composition, and valuation assumptions related to the securities AFS portfolio, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," Note 6, "Investment Securities," and the “Trading Assets and Derivative Instruments and Investment Securities” section of Note 20, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the average yield on the securities AFS portfolio was 2.69%, compared to 2.47% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in average yield was due primarily to higher benchmark interest rates and lower premium amortization. See additional discussion related to average yields on securities AFS in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section of this MD&A.

The credit quality and liquidity profile of our investment securities portfolio remained strong at December 31, 2018. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends and our overall liquidity objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment securities portfolio could change over time.

DEPOSITS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2018, we experienced continued deposit growth across most of our product categories as well as a migration from lower-cost deposits to CDs, due largely to higher interest rates. See Table 1, Table 2, and the “Net Interest Income/Margin” section in this MD&A for additional information regarding average deposit balances, rates paid, and associated impacts on net interest income. See Note 6, “Investment Securities,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding collateral pledged to secure public deposits.

Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $219 million in 2018, relatively stable compared to 2017 as growth in time deposits and NOW accounts were offset largely by declines in money market accounts and noninterest-bearing deposits. Average deposits grew in the Consumer business segment, driven by targeted client outreach, improved execution across our branch network, leveraging new pricing capabilities, and a focus on meeting our clients’ deposit needs across all channels. The Wholesale business segment experienced a decline in average deposits driven by outflows into alternative investments, corporate funding, and acquisitions. 

49

Consumer and commercial deposit growth remains one of our key areas of focus. During 2018, we continued to execute on our targeted strategy of retaining our existing depositors and capturing new market share, while managing the rates we paid for deposits. We maintained pricing discipline through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and markets. Looking forward to 2019, we expect deposit costs to continue 

to trend upwards, with the trajectory influenced by the interest rate environment and our loan growth. We remain focused on investing in products and capabilities that enhance the client experience, outside of rate paid. 

The aggregate amount outstanding of time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2018, by remaining contractual maturity, is presented in Table 15.

BORROWINGS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Short-term borrowings include funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other short-term borrowings. Our short-term borrowings at December 31, 2018 increased $4.0 billion, or 83%, from December 31, 2017, driven by increases of $4.0 billion and $271 million in outstanding FHLB advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, respectively, offset partially by a $420 million decrease in funds purchased.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1  Consists of notes with various terms that include fixed or floating interest, or returns that are linked to an equity index.

2 82% and 77% of total subsidiary debt was issued by the Bank at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

3 Includes leases and other obligations that do not have a stated interest rate.

4 Includes $289 million and $530 million of long-term debt measured at fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

50

During the year ended December 31, 2018, our long-term debt increased by $5.3 billion, or 54%. This increase was driven by our 2018 debt issuances of $4.8 billion (summarized in Table 18) as well as by increases of $1.0 billion and $530 million in outstanding FHLB advances and direct finance leases, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases were $750 million and $314 million of senior note and subordinated note maturities during the year ended December 31, 2018. We may opportunistically repurchase certain of our outstanding debt securities in the future, depending on market conditions. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Regulatory Capital

Our primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that sets capital requirements relative to the risk profiles of individual banks. The framework assigns risk weights to assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. We measure capital adequacy using the standardized approach to the FRB’s Basel III Final Rule. Basel III capital categories are discussed below.

CET1 is limited to common equity and related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, AOCI, and common equity minority interest, subject to limitations. Certain regulatory adjustments and exclusions are made to CET1, including removal of goodwill, other intangible assets, certain DTAs, and certain defined benefit pension fund net assets. Further, banks not subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules were granted a one-time permanent election to exclude AOCI from the calculation of regulatory capital. We elected to exclude AOCI from the calculation of our CET1. 

Tier 1 capital includes CET1, qualified preferred equity instruments, qualifying minority interest not included in CET1, subject to limitations, and certain other regulatory deductions. Tier 2 capital includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and minority interest not included in Tier 1 capital, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and a limited percentage of unrealized gains on equity securities. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. 

To be considered “adequately capitalized,” we are subject to minimum CET1, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital ratios of 

4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively, plus, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, CCB amounts of 1.875%, 1.25%, and 0.625%, respectively, were required to be maintained above the minimum capital ratios. The CCB was fully phased-in at 2.5% above the minimum capital ratios on January 1, 2019. The CCB places restrictions on the amount of retained earnings that may be used for capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments as risk-based capital ratios approach their respective “adequately capitalized” minimum capital ratios plus the CCB. To be considered “well-capitalized,” Tier 1 and Total capital ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. 

In April 2018, the FRB issued an NPR that included proposed modifications to minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as proposed changes to assumptions used in the stress testing process. The modifications would replace the 2.5% CCB with a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”). The SCB is the greater of (i) the difference between the actual CET1 ratio and the minimum forecasted CET1 ratio under a severely adverse scenario, based on modeling and projections performed by the Federal Reserve, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, or (ii) 2.5%. If finalized, the SCB would be calculated based on the 2019 CCAR process and be incorporated into capital requirements effective as of the fourth quarter of 2019. 

We are also subject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement, which measures Tier 1 capital against average total assets less certain deductions, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum leverage ratio threshold is 4% and is not subject to the CCB.

A transition period previously applied to certain capital elements and risk weighted assets, where phase-in percentages were applicable in the calculations of capital and RWA. One of the more significant transitions required by the Basel III Final Rule relates to the risk weighting applied to MSRs, which impacted the CET1 ratio during the transition period when compared to the CET1 ratio calculated on a fully phased-in basis. Specifically, the fully phased-in risk weight of MSRs would have been 250%, while the risk weight to be applied during the transition period was 100%. 

In the third quarter of 2017, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued two NPRs in an effort to simplify certain aspects of the capital rules, a Transitions NPR and a Simplifications NPR. The Transitions NPR proposed to extend certain transition provisions in the capital rules for banks with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. The Transitions NPR was finalized in November 2017, resulting in the MSR risk weight of 100% being extended indefinitely. The rule became effective on January 1, 2018. The Simplifications NPR would simplify the capital treatment for certain acquisition, development, and construction loans, mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. 

In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was signed into law, which provides certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulatory requirements. The federal banking agencies have proposed several rules to implement the EGRRCPA (including the October 2018 NPR discussed below), but these proposed rules are subject to finalization, and additional rulemakings by the federal regulators are expected to be issued. 

51

As a result, we continue to evaluate the impact of the EGRRCPA, but anticipate that certain of its provisions could affect our capital planning and strategy execution. See the “Enhanced Prudential Standards,” “Mandatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio,” and “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” sections of Part I, Item 1, “Business,” in this Form 10-K for more information on the EGRRCPA.

In September 2018, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued an NPR that would revise the definition of high volatility commercial real estate exposure (“HVCRE”) to conform with the statutory definition of a high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development, or construction loan, in accordance with the Act. The revised definition would exclude any loans made prior to January 1, 2015, and certain other loans currently classified as HVCRE. We are currently evaluating the impact of this NPR on our capital ratios. 

In October 2018, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued a joint NPR to address the tailoring provided for in the EGRRCPA that would establish four risk-based categories of standards for determining applicability of capital and liquidity requirements for large U.S. banking organizations. The proposal is consistent with a separate NPR issued concurrently by the FRB that would 

amend certain prudential standards, including standards relating to liquidity, risk management, stress testing, and single-counterparty credit limits, to reflect the risk profiles of banking organizations. 

In February 2019, the FRB announced that certain less-complex BHCs with less than $250 billion in assets, including the Company, would not be subject to supervisory stress testing, company-run stress testing, or CCAR for 2019.

For more information on these NPRs and announcements, see the “Enhanced Prudential Standards,” “Mandatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio,” and “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” sections of Part I, Item 1, “Business,” in this Form 10-K.

Also in October 2018, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued an NPR that introduced a new approach for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for regulatory capital purposes, the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (“SA-CCR”). If finalized, we could elect to utilize the SA-CCR in place of the current exposure methodology for determining counterparty credit risk exposures, as the SA-CCR would be optional for non-advanced approaches banking institutions.

Table 19 presents the Company's Basel III regulatory capital metrics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 We calculated these measures based on the methodology specified by our primary regulator, which may differ from the calculations used by other financial services companies that present similar metrics.

2 Basel III capital ratios are calculated under the standardized approach using regulatory capital methodology applicable to us for each period presented. 

Our CET1 ratio decreased compared to December 31, 2017, driven primarily by growth in risk weighted assets and higher share repurchases, offset partially by an increase in retained earnings. The Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios declined compared to December 31, 2017, due to the impact of our redemption of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2018 as well as the aforementioned impacts to our CET1 ratio. Specifically, we used net proceeds from our November 2017 Series H Preferred Stock issuance to redeem all 4,500 shares of our outstanding higher cost Series E Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018, our capital ratios were well above current regulatory requirements. See Note 15, “Capital,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our regulatory capital adequacy requirements and metrics.

Capital Actions

We declared and paid common dividends of $826 million, or $1.80 per common share, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $634 million, or $1.32 per common share, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $498 million, or $1.00 per common share, during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we paid dividends on our preferred stock of $107 million, $94 million, and $66 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

52

Various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities restrict the Bank’s ability to distribute its retained earnings. At December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Bank's capacity to pay cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations totaled approximately $2.2 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.5 billion, respectively.

During the first half of 2018, we repurchased $660 million of our outstanding common stock at market value, which completed our $1.32 billion of authorized common equity repurchases approved by the Board in conjunction with the 2017 capital plan.

In June 2018, we announced capital plans in response to the Federal Reserve’s review of and non-objection to our 2018 capital plan submitted in conjunction with the 2018 CCAR. Our 2018 capital plan includes increases in our share repurchase program and quarterly common stock dividend, while maintaining our level of preferred stock dividends. Specifically, the 2018 capital plan authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock to be completed between the third quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2019, as well as a 25% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.40 per share to $0.50 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2018. 

During the second half of 2018, we repurchased $1.25 billion of our outstanding common stock at market value as part of this 2018 capital plan. In January 2019, we repurchased an additional $250 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2018 capital plan pursuant to an SEC Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan entered into on November 6, 2018, and we do not intend to utilize our remaining share repurchase capacity of $500 million under the 2018 capital plan. 

See Item 5 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our share repurchase activity, and Note 15, “Capital,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our capital actions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our significant accounting policies are integral to understanding our financial performance and are described in detail in Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because (1) they require judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and (2) different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different outcomes with respect to the recognition and measurement of certain assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies, with corresponding impacts on earnings. Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period, and that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. 

The following is a description of our current critical accounting policies.

Contingencies

We face uncertainty with respect to the outcomes of various contingencies, including the allowance for credit losses and legal and regulatory matters.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is composed of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the LHFI portfolio based on current economic conditions. The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. The ALLL is determined based on our review of certain LHFI that are individually evaluated for impairment and pools of LHFI with similar risk characteristics that are evaluated on a collective basis. Our loss estimate includes an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflected in the historical loss, risk-rating, or other indicative data.

Large commercial nonaccrual loans and certain commercial and consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR, are reviewed to determine the amount of specific allowance required in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. For this purpose, we consider the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition, or the loan's estimated market value. We use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to assess the extent of impairment in the portfolio and employ judgment in assigning or estimating internal risk ratings, market and collateral values, discount rates, and loss rates.

General allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics. The ALLL Committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors for each loan portfolio segment, including net charge-off trends, internal risk ratings, changes in internal risk ratings, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, delinquency rates, nonperforming and restructured loan status, origination channel, product mix, underwriting practices, industry conditions, and economic trends. In addition to these factors, the consumer and residential portfolio segments consider borrower FICO scores, and the commercial portfolio segment considers single name borrower concentration.

Estimated collateral values are based on appraisals, broker price opinions, automated valuation models, other collateral-specific information, and/or relevant market information, supplemented when applicable with valuations performed by internal valuation professionals. Their values reflect an orderly disposition, inclusive of marketing costs. In limited instances, we adjust externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well supported reasons, such as an appraiser not being aware of certain collateral-specific factors or recent sales information. Appraisals generally represent the “as is” value of the collateral but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy. 

53

Our determination of the ALLL for commercial loans is sensitive to the assigned internal risk ratings and inherent expected loss rates. A downgrade of one level in the PD risk ratings for all commercial loans and leases would have increased the ALLL by approximately $446 million at December 31, 2018. If the estimated loss severity rates for the entire commercial loan portfolio were increased by 10%, the ALLL for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately $106 million at December 31, 2018. 

The allowance for consumer loans is also sensitive to changes in estimated loss severity rates. If the estimated loss severity rates for these loans increased by 10%, the total ALLL for the consumer portfolio would increase by approximately $39 million at December 31, 2018. These sensitivity analyses are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and estimated loss severity rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed, management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, could reach different conclusions that could be material to our financial statements. 

In addition to the ALLL, we estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk using our internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in combination with probability of commitment usage, and any other pertinent information, are utilized in estimating the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.

Our financial results are affected by the changes in the allowance for credit losses. This process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit losses. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income. For additional information on our allowance for credit losses, see the “Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A as well as Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 7, “Loans,” and Note 8, “Allowance for Credit Losses,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Legal and Regulatory Matters

We are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts, and the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements.

We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims only when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The liability is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, 

and the related expense is recorded in the applicable category of Noninterest expense, depending on the nature of the legal matter, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Significant judgment may be required in determining both probability of loss and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. In many such proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.

Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Note 21, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding legal and regulatory matters.

Estimates of Fair Value

The objective of a fair value measurement is to use market-based inputs or assumptions, when available, to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we evaluate pricing for similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices for such assets or liabilities are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, we employ other techniques for estimating fair value (for example, obtaining third party price quotes or using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flows). The resulting valuation may include significant judgments, particularly when the market for an asset or liability is not active.

Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that include significant inputs that are not observable in the market are classified as level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. We have instituted various processes and controls surrounding these measurements to ensure appropriate methodologies are utilized. We maintain a cross-functional approach when estimating the fair value of these difficult to value financial instruments. This includes input from not only the related line of business, but also from risk management and finance, to ultimately arrive at an appropriate estimate of the instrument’s fair value. This process often involves the gathering of multiple sources of information, including broker quotes, values provided by pricing services, trading activity in other similar instruments, market indices, and pricing matrices. 

Modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique. These assessments are subjective; the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. We employed significant unobservable inputs when estimating the fair value of certain securities AFS and derivative instruments (primarily IRLCs), LHFI accounted for at fair value, and residential MSRs.

54

We record all single-family residential MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of residential MSRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses and can vary significantly quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. We provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure residential MSRs, including the uncertainty of the fair values to adverse changes to these assumptions, in Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The key assumptions do not take into account hedging activities discussed in the “Other Market Risk” section of this MD&A.

Overall, the financial impact of the level 3 financial instruments did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital. Table 20 discloses assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that are classified as level 3 measurements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Level 3 securities AFS decreased by $72 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by sales of non-agency residential MBS and ABS. For a detailed discussion regarding level 3 financial instruments and valuation methodologies for each class of financial instrument, see Note 20, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Goodwill

At December 31, 2018, our reporting units were Consumer and Wholesale. See Note 22, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of our reportable business segments. We conduct a 

qualitative goodwill assessment at the reporting unit level at least quarterly, or more frequently as events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Factors considered in our qualitative assessment include financial performance, financial forecasts, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, market capitalization, carrying value, and events affecting the reporting units. If, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, we determine it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is necessary to perform. If we elect to bypass the qualitative analysis, or conclude from our qualitative analysis that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed either (i) annually as of October 1, or (ii) more frequently as considered necessary. In the first step of the impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then a second step is performed, which measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value. 

We performed a qualitative goodwill assessment for the Consumer and Wholesale reporting units as of October 1, 2018, and concluded that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary for either reporting unit. We performed quantitative goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2017 and 2016, and determined that for our reporting units with goodwill balances, the fair values were in excess of their respective carrying amounts; therefore, no goodwill impairment was recognized. For additional information, see Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

When we perform a quantitative analysis, the carrying value of equity of the reporting units, as well as Corporate Other, is determined by allocating our total equity to each reporting unit based on RWA using our actual Tier 1 capital ratio as of the measurement date. Tier 1 capital is utilized as it most closely aligns with equity as reported under U.S. GAAP. Appropriate adjustments are made to each reporting unit’s allocation using Tier 1 capital to conform with U.S. GAAP equity, namely to add back equity tied to goodwill and other intangible assets. We view this approach of determining the reporting units' carrying amounts based on regulatory capital as an objective measurement of the equity that a market participant would require to operate the reporting units.

The quantitative goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and an estimated long-term growth rate. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparing implied valuation multiples with valuation multiples from guideline companies and by comparing the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of 

55

time. Significant and sustained declines in our market capitalization could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment.

Multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, client service and retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations that a market participant would consider in valuing the reporting units. Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, size premiums, and idiosyncratic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit.

The estimated fair values of the reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions, and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, potential future changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying amount. Additionally, the carrying value of a reporting unit's equity could change based on market conditions, asset growth, preferred stock issuances, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether or not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying amount.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities where we conduct business. We estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in Other liabilities or Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results. We review our tax positions quarterly and make adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available.

Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. We regularly evaluate the realizability of DTAs. A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. We currently maintain a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards and certain other state DTAs. Since we expect to realize our remaining federal and state DTAs, no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against these DTAs at December 31, 2018. For additional income tax information, refer to the "Provision for Income Taxes" section in this MD&A as well as Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 16, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain various pension and other postretirement benefit plans for employees who meet certain requirements. Changes in the size and characteristics of the workforce or changes in the plan's design could result in a partial settlement of one or more of our pension plans. If lump sum payments were to exceed the total of interest cost and service cost for the year, settlement accounting would require immediate recognition through earnings of any net actuarial gain or loss recorded in AOCI based on the fair value of plan assets and plan obligations prior to settlement, and recognition of any related settlement costs.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reclassified $60 million of pre-tax deferred losses from AOCI into net income upon settlement of the NCF Retirement Plan. For additional information on our pension and other postretirement benefit plans as well as the NCF Retirement Plan settlement, see Note 17, “Employee Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to various risks. We have established an enterprise risk framework to identify and manage these risks and support key business objectives. Underlying this framework are limits, metrics, policies, procedures, and processes designed to effectively identify, monitor, and manage risk in line with our overall risk appetite. Our risk management philosophy is not to eliminate risk entirely but rather to only accept risks that can be effectively managed and balanced with acceptable returns while also meeting regulatory objectives.

The Board is responsible for establishing our desired overall risk appetite and for oversight of risk management processes through the BRC. The BRC reports to and assists the Board in 

56

overseeing enterprise risk management (i.e., credit, market, liquidity, operational, technology, compliance, reputational, and strategic risk), enterprise capital adequacy, and material regulatory matters. The CRO provides overall vision, direction, and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management framework and risk management culture. The CRO reports to the CEO and the BRC.

Enterprise Risk establishes sound risk and governance frameworks, policies, procedures, and processes that focus on identifying, measuring, analyzing, managing, and reporting the risks that we face. Enterprise Risk fulfills its independent risk oversight responsibilities by developing, deploying, and monitoring enterprise-wide frameworks and policies to manage risk. At its core, Enterprise Risk's objective is to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities throughout the organization that:

•Align risk taking with the risk appetite established by the Board,

•Identify, measure, analyze, manage, escalate, and report risk at the transaction, portfolio, and enterprise levels,

•Support client facing businesses as they seek to balance risk taking with business and safety/soundness objectives,

•Optimize decision making,

•Promote sound processes and regulatory compliance,

•Maximize shareholder value, and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our risk management culture operates within the context of our broader, purpose-driven corporate culture. Risk awareness within our culture informs the manner in which teammates act in the absence of specific guidance. Our teammates are expected to: 

•Put the client first,

•Exhibit strong personal and professional risk leadership, integrity, and ethics in all business dealings,

•Understand risks encountered and demonstrate a commitment to managing risks through individual actions,

•Demonstrate honesty, fairness, and respect in all internal and external interactions, and

•Emphasize the importance of executional excellence in all activities.

Our enterprise risk structure and processes are founded upon a comprehensive risk management roles and responsibilities framework, which delineates accountabilities across four dimensions.

•Risk Owners develop and implement strategies to drive opportunities; own accountability for business risks and control design/effectiveness to operate within the policies, standards, and limits set by Risk Oversight; escalate changes in the business or the risk environment that could affect risk appetite and control environment; and provide sufficient resources and infrastructure to manage activities to meet strategic objectives within risk appetite.

•Business Controls identify and assess the risks the business takes or is exposed to while conducting its activities; provide input to and accept articulation of risk appetite in policies, standards, and limits set by Risk Oversight; provide business analyses and support; determine whether business activities operate within policies, standards, and limits; and facilitate ongoing risk and control self-assessments to document, monitor, and evaluate control design and effectiveness. 

•Risk Oversight provides independent oversight of all risk taking and risk management activities across all risk types and businesses; facilitates risk appetite expression by the Board within corporate strategic planning processes; sets risk management policies, standards, and limits; provides credible, independent challenge to risk owners and business' risk and control self-assessments; independently monitors, challenges, and reports on aggregate business results within risk appetite framework.

•Risk Assurance provides independent assessments of the risk management and internal control framework and systems. The scope of these assessments includes, but is not limited to, compliance with policies, standards, and limits; effectiveness of the independent risk management function; completeness and accuracy of information; and independent assessment of credit quality. 

In practice, risk measurement activities occur at all levels of the organization. Enterprise Risk uses a variety of tools, reports, and analyses to evaluate specific exposures in order to:

•Provide a holistic view of risks,

•Present quantitative and qualitative assessments of current risks, which may be predictive of future risk trends and levels, and

•Promote transparency by fostering direct communication between Executive Management and the Board.

Enterprise risk governance is supported by a number of chartered risk-focused senior management committees. These “executive committees” are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management within their respective areas of authority, and include the ERC, ALCO, CC, PMC, EBPC, TMC, and SIRC.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•ALCO is chaired by the CFO and ensures that proper measurement, monitoring, management, and control processes are in place to achieve our ALM and liquidity risk management goals. 

•CC is also chaired by the CFO and ensures that the proper measurement, monitoring, management, and control processes are in place to achieve our strategic capital goals, while also continuing to manage our risk-capital balance to meet regulatory capital adequacy and stakeholder return expectations. 

•PMC is chaired by the Wholesale Segment Executive and facilitates the development of portfolio strategy that 

57

addresses capital utilization, balance sheet optimization, and risk concentrations. 

•EBPC is chaired by the Chief Human Resources Officer and is in place to assess and make determinations regarding our business practices to ensure alignment with core purpose, principles, and values, and to share best practices. EBPC also serves as the forum for enterprise reputational risk exposures.

•TMC is chaired by the CIO and provides a forum to discuss, debate, and challenge technology strategies and investments to ensure alignment of technology strategy execution across our organization.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The CEO, CFO, and CRO are members of each of these executive committees. Additionally, other executive and senior officers are members of these committees based upon their responsibilities and subject matter expertise.

Enterprise Risk continually refines our risk governance structures, frameworks and management limits, policies, procedures, and processes to reflect ongoing changes in our operating environment and/or corporate goals and strategies.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments, including on-balance sheet exposures from loans, leases, and investment securities, as well as contingent exposures including unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit derivatives, and counterparty risk under derivative products. As credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients, the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintaining the long-run profitability and capital adequacy of our business. We commit to maintain and enhance a comprehensive credit system to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards. 

Enterprise Risk establishes and oversees adherence to the credit risk management governance frameworks and policies, independently measures, analyzes, and reports on loan portfolio and risk trends, and actively participates in the formulation of our credit strategies. Credit risk officers and supporting teammates within our lines of business are direct participants in the origination, underwriting, and ongoing management of credit. They work to promote an appropriate balance between our risk management and business objectives through adherence to established policies, procedures, and standards. Credit Review, one of our independent assurance functions, regularly assesses and reports on business unit and enterprise asset quality, and the integrity of our credit processes. Additionally, total borrower exposure limits and concentration risks are established and monitored. Credit risk may be mitigated through purchase 

of credit loss protection via third party insurance and/or use of credit derivatives such as CDS.

Borrower/counterparty (obligor) risk and facility risk is evaluated using our risk rating methodology, which is utilized in all lines of business. We use various risk models to estimate both expected and unexpected loss, which incorporates both internal and external default and loss experience. To the extent possible, we collect and use internal data to ensure the validity, reliability, and accuracy of our risk models used in default, severity, and loss estimation. See the “Critical Accounting Policies—Allowance for Credit Losses” section of this MD&A and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information on our credit risk management activities as well as our ALLL accounting policy and determination. Information regarding our credit quality indicators can be found in Note 7, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Operational Risk Management

We face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products, and we depend on our ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As the potential for operational loss remains elevated and as client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, we continue to enhance our efforts to safeguard and monitor our operational systems and infrastructure.

We believe that effective management of operational risk, defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, plays a major role in both the level and the stability of our profitability. Our Enterprise Operational Risk Management function oversees an enterprise-wide framework intended to identify, assess, control, monitor, and report on operational risks. These processes support our goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen our performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred. 

Cybersecurity Risk Management

Our business activities and operations rely on our systems, computers, software, data, networks, the internet, and digital applications, as well as the systems and infrastructure of third parties. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other systems or infrastructure may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors and influences that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as potential failures, disruptions, or breakdowns, whether as a result of human error or intentional attack, as well as market conditions, fraudulent activities, natural disasters, electrical or telecommunications outages, political or social matters including terrorist acts, country risk, vendor risk, cyber-attacks, or other security risks. The use of digital technologies introduces cybersecurity risk that can manifest in the form of information theft, criminal acts by individuals, groups, or nation states, or other disruptions to our Company's, clients', or third parties' 

58

business operations. We use a wide array of techniques to secure our operations and proprietary information such as Board approved policies and programs, network monitoring, access controls, and dedicated security personnel, as well as consultation with third party data security experts.

To control cybersecurity risk, we maintain an active information security program that is designed to conform with FFIEC guidance. This information security program is designed to mitigate operational risks and is overseen by executive management, the Board, and our independent audit function. This program continually monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of our business operations and continually adapts and modifies its risk mitigation activities accordingly. We also utilize appropriate cybersecurity insurance that controls against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cyber risk. In addition, our Board devotes significant time and attention to oversight of cybersecurity risk. 

Further, we have adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework ("CSF") and perform periodic assessments against the framework to measure cybersecurity maturity. We also fully participate in the federally recognized financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Digital technology is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond our risk control thresholds. Although we invest substantial time and resources to manage and reduce cyber risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk.

Our BRC reviews and approves policies relating to enterprise technology risk, business continuity management, information security, and enterprise data quality governance. The BRC also reviews and approves key technology risks and associated action plans. To ensure the integrity of our crisis management program, routine testing simulations are utilized to validate the viability of our plans. These ongoing tests are designed to provide assurance that our action plans are effective, valuable, and usable in the event of a significant business disruption. Crisis exercises are scenario-driven exercises that simulate impacts and consequences. Scenarios are developed through analysis of technology incidents, known cyber threats, internal stakeholder input, and industry trends.

We maintain an information security education and awareness program to provide consistent messaging to all users that may require access to our information about the need to maintain the security and privacy of that information. All users (i.e., full-time teammates, contractors, third parties, etc.) must complete this training before being granted access to our information systems. The content of the training program is reviewed annually to ensure that it addresses the current needs of our organization. In addition, communications to teammates through our intranet site, newsletters, email broadcasts, and targeted emails to select teammates, as necessary, foster awareness of information security risks. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks associated with a failure or breach of our operational systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber-attacks.

Market Risk Management

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to changes in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from changes in the structure and composition of our balance sheet. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, were approximately 57% of total loans at December 31, 2018, and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, were approximately 50% of total loans. Less than 5% of our variable rate loans at December 31, 2018 had coupon rates that were equal to a contractually specified interest rate floor. In addition to balance sheet related interest rate risk, we are also exposed to market risk in our trading portfolios and other financial instruments measured at fair value. Our ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our ALM and liquidity risk position in conformance with the established policies and limits designed to measure, monitor, and control market risk.

Market Risk from Non-Trading Activities 

The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the Board. These limits reflect our appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No limit breaches occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the absolute level and shape of the yield curve, as well as the embedded optionality in our products and related customer behavior. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, which, as described in additional detail below, are employed by management to understand net interest income sensitivity and MVE sensitivity. These measures show that our interest rate risk profile is modestly asset sensitive at December 31, 2018. 

MVE and net interest income sensitivity are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together. Net interest income sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing differences over one year and is considered a shorter term measure. MVE sensitivity captures the change in the discounted net present value of all on- and off-balance sheet items and is considered a longer term measure.

Positive net interest income sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year, asset based interest income will increase more quickly than liability based interest expense. A negative MVE sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that the value of financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities. 

One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. We measure the sensitivity of net interest income over a one-year time horizon, as reflected in Table 21, as well as for multi-year time horizons. Key assumptions in this form of simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the 

59

changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates various assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the repricing and behavioral fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.

As the future path of interest rates is not known, we use a simulation analysis to project net interest income under various and potentially extreme scenarios. These scenarios may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.

The sensitivity analysis presented in Table 21 is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to instantaneous moves in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Estimated % change of net interest income is reflected on a non-FTE basis.

Net interest income asset sensitivity at December 31, 2018 decreased slightly compared to December 31, 2017, driven primarily by an increase in wholesale funding. See additional discussion related to net interest income in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section of this MD&A.

We also perform valuation analyses, which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation horizon. Whereas a net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, our valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. 

The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and embedded optionality in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. However, MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate originations of new/replacement business or balance sheet growth that may be used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Significant MVE assumptions include those that drive prepayment speeds, expected changes in balances, and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. 

At December 31, 2018, the MVE profile in Table 22 indicates a decline in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. This MVE sensitivity is reported for both upward and downward rate shocks. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

MVE sensitivity for upward and downward rate shocks at December 31, 2018 decreased compared to December 31, 2017, driven primarily by a decline in the duration of hedging positions as well as by changes in interest rates and balance sheet mix. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these rate scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact.

Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Furthermore, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.

Market Risk from Trading Activities 

We manage market risk associated with trading activities using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes VAR metrics, stress testing, and sensitivity analyses. Risk metrics are measured and monitored on a daily basis at both the trading desk and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with our risk appetite. Our risk measurement for covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators takes into account trading exposures resulting from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk. 

For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from one or more trading positions, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR results are monitored daily against established limits. For risk management purposes, our VAR calculation is based on a historical simulation and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. This means that, on average, trading losses could exceed VAR one out of 100 trading days or two to three times per year. Due to inherent limitations of the VAR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits.

60

In addition to VAR, as required by the Market Risk Rule, we calculate Stressed VAR, which is used as a component of the total market risk capital charge. We calculate the Stressed VAR risk measure using a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employ a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for our trading portfolio. The historical period used in the selection of the stress window encompasses all financial crises since January 1, 2008. Our Stressed VAR calculation uses the same methodology and models as VAR, which is a requirement under the Market Risk Rule. Table 23 presents VAR and Stressed VAR for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as VAR by Risk Factor at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VAR, is predominantly comprised of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. In support of our comprehensive range of capital market activity, the trading 

portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives; however, these related trading risk exposures are not material. Our covered positions result primarily from underwriting and market making services for our clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio’s VAR profile, presented in Table 23, is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. Notwithstanding normal variations in the VAR associated with individual risk factors, average daily VAR as well as period end VAR for the year ended December 31, 2018 remained largely unchanged compared to the same period in 2017. Stressed VAR remained within comparable historic ranges throughout the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting typical fluctuations in portfolio composition and balance sheet usage, along with changes in risk factor levels. The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions or on- or off-balance sheet securitization positions during the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, we evaluate the accuracy of our VAR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VAR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, there were two firmwide VAR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. These two backtesting exceptions were driven primarily by credit spread widening during the broader sell-off in equity and credit markets during the latter half of December 2018, which impacted our corporate credit trading portfolio of bonds and loans. The total number of firmwide VAR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VAR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.

We have valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for all covered positions. Additionally, trading positions are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are subject to independent price verification. See Note 19, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” and Note 20, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, as well as the “Critical Accounting Policies” MD&A section of this Form 10-K for discussion of valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies.

Model risk management: Our approach regarding the validation and evaluation of the accuracy of our internal models, external models, and associated processes, includes developmental and implementation testing as well as ongoing monitoring and maintenance performed by the various model developers, in conjunction with model owners. Our MRMG is responsible for the independent model validation of all trading risk models. The validation typically includes evaluation of all model documentation as well as model monitoring and maintenance plans. We regularly review the performance of all trading risk models through our model monitoring and maintenance process to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress testing: We use a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VAR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Our stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest 

rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in our comprehensive stress testing framework. We review stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and make updates as necessary to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately.

Trading portfolio capital adequacy: We assess capital adequacy on a regular basis, which is based on estimates of our risk profile and capital positions under baseline and stressed scenarios. Scenarios consider significant risks, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Our assessment of capital adequacy arising from market risk includes a review of risk arising from material portfolios of covered positions. See the “Capital Resources” section in this MD&A for additional discussion of capital adequacy.

Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable, at a reasonable cost, to meet financial obligations as they come due. We manage liquidity risk consistent with our enterprise risk management practices in order to mitigate our three primary liquidity risks: (i) structural liquidity risk, (ii) market liquidity risk, and (iii) contingency liquidity risk. Structural liquidity risk arises from our maturity transformation activities and balance sheet structure, which may create differences in the timing of cash inflows and outflows. Market liquidity risk, which we also describe as refinancing or refunding risk, constitutes the risk that we could lose access to the financial markets or the cost of such access may rise to undesirable levels. Contingency liquidity risk arises from rare and severely adverse liquidity events; these 

62

events may be idiosyncratic or systemic, or a combination thereof.

We mitigate these risks utilizing a variety of tested liquidity management techniques in keeping with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. For example, we mitigate structural liquidity risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as consumer and commercial deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We mitigate market liquidity risk by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund projected cash needs and structuring our liabilities to avoid maturity concentrations. We test contingency liquidity risk from a range of potential adverse circumstances in our contingency funding scenarios. These scenarios inform the amount of contingency liquidity sources we maintain as a liquidity buffer to ensure we can meet our obligations in a timely manner under adverse contingency liquidity events. 

Governance. We maintain a comprehensive liquidity risk governance structure in keeping with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Our Board, through the BRC, oversees liquidity risk management and establishes our liquidity risk appetite via a set of cascading risk limits. The BRC reviews and approves risk policies to establish these limits and regularly reviews reports prepared by senior management to monitor compliance with these policies. The Board charges the CEO with determining corporate strategies in accordance with its risk appetite, and the CEO is a member of our ALCO, which is the executive level committee with oversight of liquidity risk management. The ALCO regularly monitors our liquidity and compliance with liquidity risk limits, and also reviews and approves liquidity management strategies and tactics.

Management and Reporting Framework. Corporate Treasury, under the oversight of the ALCO, is responsible for managing consolidated liquidity risks we encounter in the course of our business. In so doing, Corporate Treasury develops and implements short-term and long-term liquidity management strategies, funding plans, and liquidity stress tests, and also monitors early warning indicators; all of which assist in identifying, measuring, monitoring, reporting, and managing our liquidity risks. Corporate Treasury primarily monitors and manages liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments. Corporate Treasury also monitors liquidity developments of, and maintains a regular dialogue with, our other legal entities.

MRM conducts independent oversight and governance of liquidity risk management activities. For example, MRM works with Corporate Treasury to ensure our liquidity risk management practices conform to applicable laws and regulations and evaluates key assumptions incorporated in our contingency funding scenarios.

Further, the internal audit function performs the risk assurance role for liquidity risk management. Internal audit conducts an independent assessment of the adequacy of internal controls, including procedural documentation, approval processes, reconciliations, and other mechanisms employed by liquidity risk management and MRM to ensure that liquidity risk 

is consistent with applicable policies, procedures, laws, and regulations.

LCR requirements under Regulation WW require large U.S. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, each as defined under the LCR rule. At December 31, 2018, our LCR calculated pursuant to the rule was above the 100% minimum regulatory requirement. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, our average month-end LCR was 110%.

On December 19, 2016, the FRB published a final rule implementing public disclosure requirements for BHCs subject to the LCR that requires them to publicly disclose quantitative and qualitative information regarding their respective LCR calculations on a quarterly basis. We are required to disclose elements under this final rule for quarterly periods ending after October 1, 2018, which can be found on our investor relations website at http://investors.suntrust.com.

On May 3, 2016, the FRB, OCC, and the FDIC issued a joint proposed rule to implement the NSFR. The proposal would require large U.S. banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon. The FRB proposed a modified NSFR requirement for BHCs with greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets, and less than $10 billion in total on balance sheet foreign exposure. The proposed NSFR requirement seeks to (i) reduce vulnerability to liquidity risk in financial institution funding structures and (ii) promote improved standardization in the measurement, management and disclosure of liquidity risk. The proposed rule contains an implementation date of January 1, 2018; however, a final rule has not yet been issued.

On October 31, 2018, the FRB released a draft proposal designed to tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards pursuant to the EGRRCPA. Under the proposal, four categories of standards would be applied to U.S. banking organizations based on size, complexity, and other risk-based factors. If the proposal is finalized as proposed, we would no longer be subject to the mandatory LCR and proposed NSFR requirements. Internal liquidity stress testing, liquidity buffer, and liquidity risk management requirements would still apply.

Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank borrows from the money markets using instruments such as Fed Funds, Eurodollars, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At December 31, 2018, the Bank retained a material cash position in its Federal Reserve account. The Parent Company also retained a material cash position in its account with the Bank in accordance with our policies and risk limits, discussed in greater detail below.

Sources of Funds. Our primary source of funds is a large, stable deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits originated primarily from our retail branch network and Wholesale client base, are our largest and most cost-effective source of funding. Total deposits increased to $162.6 billion at December 31, 2018, from $160.8 billion at December 31, 2017. 

63

We also maintain access to diversified sources for both secured and unsecured wholesale funding. These uncommitted sources include Fed Funds purchased from other financial institutions, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and Global Bank Notes. Aggregate borrowings increased to $23.8 billion at December 31, 2018, from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2017. These additional borrowings include a mix of both secured and unsecured funding and have primarily been used to support loan growth.

The Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities, such as common or preferred stock. In August 2018, our Board approved a new SEC shelf registration, which authorized the issuance of up to $6.0 billion of such securities, of which $5.9 billion of issuance capacity remained available at December 31, 2018. Under our previous SEC shelf registration, the Board authorized the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of such securities, of which $1.7 billion of issuance capacity remained available at December 31, 2017.

The Bank maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. At December 31, 2018, the Bank retained $31.5 billion of remaining capacity to issue notes under the Global Bank Note program. Refer to Table 18 in the “Borrowings” section for details regarding Bank and Parent Company debt issuances completed during 2018.

Our issuance capacity under these Bank and Parent Company programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, which is a formal program capacity and not a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities depends upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, our credit ratings, investor perception of financial market conditions, and the health of the banking sector. Therefore, our ability to access these markets in the future could be impaired for either idiosyncratic or systemic reasons.

We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and during times of unusual, adverse events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding scenarios and plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as severe economic recessions, financial market disruptions, and credit rating downgrades. In particular, a ratings downgrade could adversely impact the cost and availability of some of our liquid funding sources. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent 

Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. 

As illustrated in Table 24, S&P assigned a “Credit Watch Positive” outlook on our credit rating, while both Moody’s and Fitch assigned “Positive” outlooks. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given these “Credit Watch Positive” and “Positive” credit rating outlooks.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 In February 2019, following our announced intention to merge with BB&T (as discussed in Note 25, “Subsequent Event,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K), S&P revised our credit rating outlook from “Positive” to “Credit Watch Positive,” and both Moody’s and Fitch revised our credit rating outlook from “Stable” to “Positive.” The credit ratings and outlook presented in the above table reflect these updates.

Our investment securities portfolio is a store of liquidity that is managed as part of our overall liquidity management and ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value, maintaining the majority of securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes, such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities; nearly all of these securities qualify as high-quality liquid assets under the U.S. LCR Final Rule. At December 31, 2018, our securities AFS portfolio contained $28.0 billion of unencumbered, high-quality liquid securities at market value.

As mentioned above, we evaluate contingency funding scenarios to anticipate and manage the likely impact of impaired capital markets access and other adverse liquidity circumstances. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingency liquidity. These contingency liquidity sources include available cash reserves, the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in our investment portfolio, the capacity to borrow from the FHLB system or the Federal Reserve discount window, and the ability to sell or securitize certain loan portfolios. Table 25 presents period end and average balances of our contingency liquidity sources for 2018 and 2017. These sources exceed our contingency liquidity needs as measured in our contingency funding scenarios.

1 Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. We previously acquired capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta as a precondition for becoming a member of that institution. As a member, we are able to take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and to access grants and low-cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects, among other benefits. At December 31, 2018, we held $227 million of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta, an increase of $212 million compared to December 31, 2017 due to an increase in short-term FHLB advances over the same period. For each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized an immaterial amount of dividends related to FHLB capital stock.

Similarly, to remain a member of the Federal Reserve System, we are required to hold a certain amount of capital stock, determined as either a percentage of the Bank’s capital or as a percentage of total deposit liabilities. At both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we held $403 million of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta stock. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized dividends related to Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta stock of $12 million, $9 million, and $8 million, respectively.

Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and forecasted obligations using its cash resources. We measure and manage this metric using forecasts from both normal and adverse conditions. Under adverse conditions, we measure how long the Parent Company can meet its capital and debt service obligations after experiencing material attrition of short-term unsecured funding and without the support of dividends from the Bank or access to the capital markets. Our ALCO and the Board have established risk limits against these metrics to manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its net maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. A majority of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of issuances of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes. See the “Borrowings” section of this MD&A as well as Note 13, “Borrowings and Contractual Commitments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding our debt.

We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that it can quickly convert into cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital service) for an extended period of months in accordance with our risk limits.

The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, loans to our subsidiaries, and common share repurchases. See further details of the authorized common share repurchases in the “Capital Resources” section of this MD&A and in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K. We fund corporate dividends with Parent Company cash, the primary sources of which are dividends from our banking subsidiary and proceeds from the issuance of debt and capital securities. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances. The Bank is also subject to federal and state laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay to the Parent Company, which could affect the Parent Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.

Other Liquidity Considerations. As presented in Table 26, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $93.0 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at December 31, 2018. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $2.9 billion in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2018, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $155 million of these letters were available to support variable rate demand obligations at December 31, 2018. Unused commercial lines of credit increased since December 31, 2017, driven by an increase in commercial line of credit commitments during the year ended December 31, 2018. Unused CRE lines of credit also increased since December 31, 2017, driven primarily by an increase in CRE line of credit commitments during the year ended December 31, 2018.

1 Includes residential mortgage IRLCs with notional balances of $992 million and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

2 Includes commercial mortgage IRLCs and other commitments with notional balances of $360 million and $240 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Other Market Risk

Other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding loans, securities designated for sale, and mortgage loan commitments, as well as the risk associated with our investment in servicing rights. We manage the risks associated with mortgage LHFS and our IRLCs on mortgage loans intended for sale. The mortgage LHFS and IRLCs consist of fixed and adjustable rate residential and commercial mortgage loans. The risk associated with mortgage LHFS and IRLCs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold, which is typically 30-150 days.

We manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps, futures, and forward sale agreements, where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of mortgage LHFS and IRLCs. IRLCs on mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as derivative instruments and are not designated for hedge accounting purposes.

All servicing rights are initially measured at fair value by calculating the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the associated servicing portfolio. The initial value of servicing rights is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the servicing portfolio, which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates, primarily the current 30-year mortgage rate. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated.

We measure our residential MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis and hedge the risk associated with changes in fair value. Residential MSRs totaled $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are managed and monitored as part of a comprehensive risk governance process, which includes established risk limits.

We originated residential MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $336 million and $394 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, we purchased residential MSRs with a fair value of approximately $89 million during the year 

ended December 31, 2018. No residential MSRs were purchased during the year ended December 31, 2017. 

We recognized mark-to-market decreases in the fair value of residential MSRs of $149 million and $248 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in fair value include the UPB decay resulting from the realization of monthly net servicing cash flows as well as credit decay resulting from shifts in the delinquency status of the underlying loans. We recognized net losses on residential MSRs, inclusive of fair value changes and related hedges, of $249 million and $212 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Compared to the prior year, the increase in net losses on residential MSRs was primarily driven by a decrease in net hedge performance combined with higher decay in the current period. All other servicing rights, which include commercial mortgage servicing rights, are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and therefore, are not subject to the same market risks associated with residential MSRs.

We held a total net book value of approximately $68 million and $22 million of non-public equity exposures (direct investments) and other equity-related investments at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We generally hold these investments as long-term investments. If conditions in the market deteriorate, these long-term investments and other assets could incur impairment charges.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” These activities involve transactions with unconsolidated VIEs as well as other arrangements, such as commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our clients and to support ongoing operations. Additional information regarding these types of activities is included in the “Liquidity Risk Management” section of this MD&A, as well as in Note 12, “Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities,” Note 13, “Borrowings and Contractual Commitments,” and Note 18, 

66

“Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on our borrowings, tax credit investments, and lease arrangements, as well as commitments to lend to clients and to fund capital expenditures and service contracts. Table 27 presents our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, except for UTBs (discussed below), short-term borrowings (presented in the “Borrowings” section of this MD&A), and pension and other postretirement benefit plans (disclosed in Note 17, “Employee Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). For additional information regarding our unfunded lending commitments, time deposits, 

operating leases, tax credit investments, and long-term debt, refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” and “Deposits” sections of this MD&A, as well as Note 9, “Premises, Property, and Equipment,” Note 12, “Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities,” and Note 13, “Borrowings and Contractual Commitments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2018, we had UTBs of $145 million, which represent a reserve for tax positions that we have taken or expect to be taken in our tax returns, and which ultimately may not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future tax settlements are uncertain, UTBs have been excluded from Table 27. See additional discussion in Note 16, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

1 Amounts do not include interest.

2 Amounts do not include deduction of related debt issuance costs of $24 million.

3 For legally binding purchase obligations of $5 million or more, amounts include either termination fees under the associated contracts when early termination provisions exist, or the total potential obligation over the full contractual term for noncancelable purchase obligations. Payments made towards the purchase of goods or services under these contracts totaled $499 million in 2018.

4 Commitments to fund investments in affordable housing and other partnerships do not have defined funding dates as certain criteria must be met before we are obligated to fund. Accordingly, these commitments are considered to be due on demand for presentation purposes. See Note 12, "Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus 2017 

Consumer

Consumer reported net income of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $516 million, or 55%, compared to 2017. The increase was driven primarily by higher net interest income and lower provisions for credit losses and income taxes, offset partially by lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense.

Net interest income was $4.2 billion, an increase of $329 million, or 8%, compared to 2017, driven by improved spreads on deposit balances. Net interest income related to deposits increased $322 million, or 14%, driven by a 25 basis point increase in deposit spreads and a $1.9 billion, or 2%, increase in average deposit balances. Deposit balance growth was driven by increases in commercial and consumer DDAs, checking, and CD balances, offset partially by lower money market account balances. Net interest income related to LHFI increased $27 million, or 2%, driven primarily by a $1.8 billion, or 3%, increase in average LHFI balances, offset partially by a two basis point decrease in loan spreads. Consumer loan growth was driven by increases in residential mortgages, consumer direct, indirect, and guaranteed student loans, offset partially by declines in home equity products and personal credit lines.

Provision for credit losses was $148 million, a decrease of $218 million, or 60%, compared to 2017. The decrease was driven by lower net charge-offs, improved credit quality, and the release of hurricane-related ALLL reserves.

Total noninterest income was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $101 million, or 5%, compared to 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower mortgage related income and lower client transaction-related fee income (which includes service charges on deposit accounts, other charges and fees, and card fees), offset partially by increases in retail investment services and other noninterest income. The decline in client transaction-related fee income was due primarily to the impact of our adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard on January 1, 2018 and by a change in our process for recognizing card rewards expenses in third quarter of 2018. 

Total noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $35 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was driven primarily by higher outside processing and software costs due to investments in technology and process optimization during 2018 and by favorable developments with certain legal matters in the fourth quarter of 2017, offset partially by revenue recognition accounting impacts and branch network activity in the current period.

Wholesale

Wholesale reported net income of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $303 million, or 24%, compared to 2017. The increase was due to lower provision for income taxes, higher net interest income, and lower noninterest expense, offset partially by lower noninterest income and higher provision for credit losses.

Net interest income was $2.3 billion, an increase of $99 million, or 5%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by increases in loan volume and improved deposit and equity spreads, offset partially by lower loan spreads and declines in deposit volume. 

Net interest income related to deposits increased $112 million, or 14%, as a result of improved spreads, offset partially by decreased deposit volumes. Average deposit balances decreased $1.5 billion, or 3%, as a result of decreases in money market accounts and non-interest-bearing commercial DDAs, offset partially by increases in interest-bearing commercial DDAs and business CD products. Net interest income related to LHFI decreased $52 million, or 4%, as a result of lower tax exempt loan and lease spreads, which were specifically impacted by the 2017 Tax Act. Average LHFI increased $806 million, or 1%, primarily as a result of client activity in Commercial Real Estate. Net interest income related to equity increased $53 million, or 31%, due to higher equity balances and spreads.

Provision for credit losses was $60 million, an increase of $21 million, or 54%, compared to 2017, driven primarily by increases in loan balances.

Total noninterest income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $39 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. The decrease was driven largely by lower investment banking income, which decreased $24 million, or 4%, as a result of lower loan syndication, investment grade bond, and high yield bond fees, offset partially by higher mergers and acquisitions and equity origination fees. Trading income was down $8 million, or 5%, as a result of lower client-related derivative activity. These decreases were offset partially by $30 million of remeasurement gains on an equity investment following our adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial assets accounting standard on January 1, 2018 and a $11 million, or 9%, increase in commercial real estate related income as a result of higher structured real estate gains. 

Total noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $7 million compared to 2017. The decrease was due to lower incentive related compensation, offset partially by higher investment banking transaction expenses related to the impact of our adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard on January 1, 2018.

Corporate Other

Corporate Other net income was a net loss of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $332 million compared to 2017. The decrease in net income was due primarily to lower net interest income.

Net interest income was a net expense of $188 million, a decrease of $205 million compared to 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower commercial loan-related swap income due to higher benchmark interest rates. Average long-term debt increased $838 million, or 8%, and average short-term borrowings increased $949 million, or 50%, driven by balance sheet management activities. 

Total noninterest income was $57 million, a decrease of $16 million, or 22%, compared to 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in trading income, which decreased $21 million, or 91%.

Total noninterest expense was a benefit of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The benefit increased $116 million compared to 2017. The increase was due primarily to a net occupancy credit triggered by the early termination of a tenant's lease and credits for excess cash reserves recognized in 

68

2018, as well as the tax reform-related charitable contribution in the fourth quarter of 2017 to support financial well-being initiatives.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016 

Consumer

Consumer reported net income of $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $80 million, or 8%, compared 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower noninterest income, higher provision for credit losses, and higher noninterest expense, offset partially by higher net interest income and lower provision for income taxes.

Net interest income was $3.9 billion, an increase of $270 million, or 7%, compared to 2016, driven by improved spreads on deposit balances and growth in LHFI balances. Net interest income related to deposits increased $228 million, or 11%, driven by a 14 basis point increase in deposit spreads and a $3.9 billion, or 4%, increase in average deposit balances. Deposit balance growth was driven primarily by increases in checking and money market account balances. Net interest income related to LHFI increased $53 million, or 4%, driven by a $3.1 billion, or 4%, increase in average LHFI balances, offset partially by a two basis point decrease in loan spreads. Average LHFI growth was driven by increases in residential mortgages, consumer direct, indirect, guaranteed student loans, and commercial loans, offset partially by declines in home equity products.

Provision for credit losses was $366 million, an increase of $207 million compared to 2016. The increase was driven by higher reserves held for hurricane-related losses in 2017.

Total noninterest income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $162 million, or 8%, compared to 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower mortgage related income due to reduced refinancing activity and lower service charges on deposits due to the enhanced posting order process instituted during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Total noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $44 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. The increase was driven by increased investments in technology and marketing, corporate support costs, and net occupancy expense related to branch network activity, offset partially by favorable developments with certain legal matters in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Wholesale

Wholesale reported net income of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $313 million, or 34%, compared to 2016. The increase was due to higher net interest income, noninterest income, and lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by higher noninterest expense.

Net interest income was $2.2 billion, an increase of $223 million, or 11%, compared to 2016, driven primarily by higher average deposit balances and improved loan and deposit spreads. Net interest income related to deposits increased $131 million, or 20%, as a result of higher benchmark interest rates and higher average deposit balances. Average deposit balances increased 

$1.4 billion, or 3%, driven primarily by a $3.1 billion increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts and a $698 million increase in CD balances, offset largely by a $1.4 billion decrease in money market accounts and a $1.1 billion decrease in non-interest-bearing commercial DDAs. Although average LHFI was relatively flat, net interest income growth related to LHFI increased $58 million, or 5%, as a result of improved loan spreads.

Provision for credit losses was $39 million, a decrease of $243 million, or 86%, compared to 2016. The decrease was due primarily to lower nonperforming loans and lower energy-related net charge-offs.

Total noninterest income was $1.6 billion, an increase of $248 million, or 19%, compared to 2016. The increase was driven primarily by higher investment banking income, which increased $108 million, or 21%, fee income from Pillar of $72 million, higher tax credits, and other loan related fees. These increases were offset partially by declines in trading income and structured real estate gains.

Total noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, an increase of $220 million, or 15%, compared to 2016. The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Pillar in 2016, higher employee compensation expense attributable to improved business performance and ongoing investments in talent, as well as higher amortization expense associated with STCC tax credit investments, partially offset by lower operating losses. 

Corporate Other

Corporate Other net income was $295 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $116 million, or 65%, compared to 2016. The increase was due primarily to lower provision for income taxes in 2017 as a result of Form 8-K and tax reform-related items.

Net interest income was $17 million, a decrease of $145 million, or 90%, compared to 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower commercial loan-related swap income due to higher LIBOR rates. Average long-term debt increased $154 million, or 2%, and average short-term borrowings increased $344 million, or 22%, driven by balance sheet management activities. 

Total noninterest income was $73 million, a decrease of $64 million, or 47%, compared to 2016. The decrease was due to the $109 million securities AFS portfolio restructuring loss and a gain on the sale-leaseback of one of our office buildings in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $107 million gain on sale of PAC.

Total noninterest expense was $74 million, an increase of $36 million, or 95%, compared to 2016, driven primarily by higher severance costs in 2017.

Quarter Ended December 31, 2018 vs. Quarter Ended December 31, 2017

We reported net income available to common shareholders of $632 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $78 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2017. Earnings per average common diluted share were $1.40 for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $1.48 for the fourth quarter of 2017. The current quarter included $(0.10) per average common share related to the $60 million pre-tax NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge. The prior year quarter was favorably impacted by $0.39 per share of net discrete benefits in connection with Form 8-K and tax reform-related items.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, net interest income was $1.6 billion, an increase of $98 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was driven by a 10 basis point expansion in net interest margin and a $6.4 billion increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin increased to 3.27%, driven primarily by higher earning asset yields, offset partially by higher funding costs.

The provision for credit losses was $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $8 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to loan growth. 

Total noninterest income was $818 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $15 million compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by lower mortgage related income. 

Client transaction-related fee income, which includes service charges on deposit accounts, other charges and fees, and card fees, was $321 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $8 million compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of adopting the revenue recognition accounting standard, which resulted in the netting of certain expense items against this income. 

Investment banking income was $146 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $24 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to higher transaction activity in mergers and acquisitions and loan syndications, offset partially by lower transactional activity in high yield bond originations and equity offerings. 

Trading income was $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $17 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to mark-to-market valuation losses resulting from adverse market conditions and higher counterparty credit valuation reserves in the current quarter.

Mortgage related income was $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $19 million compared to the same period in 2017, driven by a $25 million decrease in mortgage production related income, offset partially by a $6 million increase in mortgage servicing related income. The decrease in mortgage production related income was due to lower production volume and lower gain on sale margins, offset partially by a repurchase reserve release during the current quarter. The increase in mortgage servicing related income was due primarily to higher servicing fees, offset partially by lower net hedge performance. 

Trust and investment management income was $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $6 million compared to the same period in 2017, due to trust termination fees received during the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Retail investment services income was $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $4 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to higher assets under management. 

Commercial real estate related income was $68 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by higher client-driven structured real estate transactional activity during the current quarter.

There were no net securities gains/(losses) recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized net securities losses of $109 million as a result of a restructuring of the securities AFS portfolio in response to the 2017 Tax Act.

Gain on sale of subsidiary totaled $107 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting from our gain from the sale of PAC. See Note 3, "Acquisitions/Dispositions," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the sale of PAC.

Total noninterest expense was $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $38 million compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease was due primarily to the net impact of $111 million related to Form 8-K and tax reform-related items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Personnel expense was $857 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $54 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the $60 million pre-tax NCF Retirement Plan settlement charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Outside processing and software expense was $242 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $28 million compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by higher software-related costs resulting from the amortization of new and upgraded technology assets. 

Marketing and customer development expense was $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $55 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the $50 million tax reform-related charitable contribution in the fourth quarter of 2017 to support financial well-being initiatives. 

Regulatory assessments expense was $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $36 million compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in regulatory assessments expense was driven by the cessation of the FDIC surcharge and a $9 million regulatory assessment credit in the current quarter. 

Operating losses totaled $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $16 million compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to higher legal and fraud-related expenses.

Other staff expense was $14 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by higher severance costs recognized during the second half of 2017, largely in connection with the voluntary early retirement program announced in our December 4, 2017 Form 8-K.

Other noninterest expense was $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $14 million compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower branch and corporate real estate closure costs and lower software writedowns in the current quarter. 

71

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $136 million compared to a benefit of $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The tax provision for the current quarter included $10 million of discrete tax benefits. The tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by a $303 million income tax benefit for the remeasurement of our December 31, 2017 DTAs and DTLs and other tax reform-

related items due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 17% compared to (11)% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition to the discrete items noted above, the year-over-year change in the effective tax rate was also impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

1 We present Net interest income-FTE, Total revenue-FTE, Net interest margin-FTE, Efficiency ratio-FTE, Tangible efficiency ratio-FTE, Adjusted tangible efficiency ratio-FTE, and Total adjusted revenue-FTE on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of Net interest income from certain loans and investments using a federal tax rate of 21% for all periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and 35% for all periods prior to January 1, 2018, as well as state income taxes, where applicable, to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. We believe the FTE basis is the preferred industry measurement basis for these measures and that it enhances comparability of Net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Total revenue-FTE is calculated as Net interest income-FTE plus Noninterest income. Net interest margin-FTE is calculated by dividing annualized Net interest income-FTE by average Total earning assets.

2 We present Tangible book value per common share, which removes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets, noncontrolling interest, and preferred stock from shareholders' equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the amount of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity, and removing the amounts of noncontrolling interest and preferred stock that do not represent our common shareholders' equity, it allows investors to more easily compare our capital position to other companies in the industry. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4 Efficiency ratio is computed by dividing Noninterest expense by Total revenue. Efficiency ratio-FTE is computed by dividing Noninterest expense by Total revenue-FTE.

5 We present Tangible efficiency ratio-FTE and Adjusted tangible efficiency ratio-FTE, which exclude amortization related to intangible assets and certain tax credits. We believe these measures are useful to investors because, by removing the impact of amortization (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. Tangible efficiency ratio-FTE is utilized by management to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

7 We present certain capital information on a tangible basis, including the ratio of Tangible common equity to tangible assets, Tangible equity, and Tangible common equity, which removes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe these measures are useful to investors because, by removing the amount of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital position to other companies in the industry. These measures are utilized by management to analyze capital adequacy.

Net of deferred taxes of $163 million, $254 million, $253 million, and $252 million at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively. Net of deferred taxes of $251 million, $240 million, and $214 million at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

10 We present certain income statement categories and also Adjusted tangible efficiency ratio-FTE, Total adjusted revenue-FTE, Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, Adjusted noninterest income, Adjusted noninterest expense, and Adjusted diluted net income per average common share, which exclude Form 8-K and tax reform-related items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as other legacy mortgage-related items recognized in 2014. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they remove the effects of material items impacting the periods' results and are more reflective of normalized operations as they reflect results that are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. Removing these items also allows investors to compare our results to other companies in the industry that may not have had similar items impacting their results. Additional detail on these items can be found in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
