3.Policy Elements

3.1Authority to Recoup Incentive Compensation

Every Incentive Compensation Plan and Incentive Compensation award agreement shall authorize the Compensation Committee, the SEIRC or the FIP Plan Owners (each referred to herein as a “Responsible Party(ies)” to recoup Incentive Compensation from any teammate or former teammate under their responsibility in the following circumstances:

3.1.a.Authority to Recoup Incentive Compensation

If a Responsible Party determines that a financial metric used to determine vesting or payment of a Grant was calculated incorrectly, whether or not SunTrust is required to restate its financial statements and without regard to whether such miscalculation was due to fraud or intentional misconduct, then the Responsible Party may require reimbursement of all or part of a Grant previously vested or paid to Grantee and/or authorize the cancellation of unpaid or unvested Grants in the amount by which any such Grant exceeded a lower vesting or payment that would have been made based on the correctly calculated financial metric. In addition, the Grant shall be subject to the claw back requirements of (i) §954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (regarding recoupment of erroneously awarded compensation) and implementing rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) §304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (regarding recoupment upon restated financial information) and rules and regulations thereunder, (iii) similar rules under the laws of other jurisdictions and (iv) policies adopted by SunTrust to implement such requirements, all to the extent determined by the Responsible Party to be applicable to Grantee.

3.1.b.Detrimental Conduct

If a Responsible Party determines that Grantee has engaged in Detrimental Conduct, then the Responsible Party may require Grantee to reimburse SunTrust all or a portion of the Grant previously vested or paid and/or will be subject to cancellation of all or a portion of the unvested or unpaid Grant. “Detrimental Conduct” means any one of the following:

(1)the commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty in the course of Grantee's employment;

(2)improper conduct by Grantee including, but not limited to fraud, unethical conduct, falsification of SunTrust's records, unauthorized removal of SunTrust property or information, theft, violent acts or threats of violence, unauthorized possession of controlled substances on the property of SunTrust, conduct causing reputational harm to SunTrust or its clients, or the use of SunTrust property, facilities or services for unauthorized or illegal purposes;

(3)the improper disclosure by Grantee of proprietary, privileged or confidential information of SunTrust or a SunTrust client or former client or breach of a fiduciary duty owed to SunTrust or a SunTrust client or

former client;

(4)the commission of a criminal act by Grantee, whether or not performed in the workplace, that constitutes a felony or a crime of comparable magnitude under applicable law as determined by SunTrust in its sole discretion, or that subjects, or if generally known, would subject SunTrust to public ridicule or embarrassment;

(5)the commission of an act or omission which causes Grantee or SunTrust to be in violation of federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, and/or the rules of any exchange or association of which SunTrust is a member, including statutory disqualification;

(6)Grantee's failure to perform the duties of Grantee's job which SunTrust views as being material to Grantee's position and the overall business of SunTrust under circumstances where such failure is detrimental to SunTrust;

(7)the material breach of a written policy applicable to teammates of SunTrust including, but not limited to, the SunTrust Code of Business Conduct and Ethics;

(8)an act or omission by Grantee which results or is intended to result in personal gain at the expense of SunTrust; or

(9)any other act or omission which constitutes Cause for termination of Grantee’s employment (whether or not Grantee’s employment is actually terminated).

3.1.c.Loss

In order to encourage sustainable, long-term performance, Grants shall be specifically conditioned on SunTrust and its lines of business remaining profitable during the period from the Grant Date until the applicable vesting or payment date. If a Responsible Party determines that a loss has occurred, then the Responsible Party shall review such losses and Grantee's accountability for such losses and may require reimbursement of all or part of a Grant previously vested or paid to Grantee, and/or to authorize the cancellation of unpaid or unvested Grants. In making such determination, the Responsible Party shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including (i) the magnitude of the loss (including positive or negative variance from plan); (ii) Grantee's degree of involvement (including such factors as Grantee's current or former leadership role with respect to SunTrust or the relevant line of business, and the degree to which Grantee was involved in decisions that are determined to have contributed to the loss); and (iii) Grantee's performance.

3.2Mandatory Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation

In the event that SunTrust is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement due to its material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under federal securities laws, then SunTrust shall recoup the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive Compensation paid to any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer, as provided below (disregarding whether the Accounting Restatement was due to misconduct).

3.2.a.Amount to be Recouped

The amount of Incentive Compensation subject to Section 3.2 (the “erroneously awarded Incentive Compensation”) shall be the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been received by a current or former Executive Officer had it been determined based on the Accounting Restatement, and shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be based on the Compensation Committee’s reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was received. SunTrust shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the NYSE.

3.2.b.Incentive Compensation Performance Periods Subject to Recoupment

The requirements of this Section 3.2 shall apply to all Incentive Compensation received during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that SunTrust is required to prepare a restatement of its previously issued financial statements to correct a material error, as well as to any stub period or transition period (that results from a change in SunTrust's fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year).

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.2.b. to the contrary, in addition to the above, the performance periods subject to recoupment also shall include the periods of recoupment required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 to the extent not included above.

3.2.c.Effect of Impracticability of Recoupment

SunTrust must recoup erroneously awarded compensation in compliance with this Recoupment Policy except to the extent that it would be impracticable to do so. Recoupment would be impracticable only if the Responsible Party determines that the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy would exceed the amount to be recouped. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recoup any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, SunTrust must first make a reasonable attempt to recoup that erroneously awarded compensation. SunTrust shall preserve a record of each such attempt to recoup.

3.2.d.Prohibition of Indemnification

SunTrust shall not indemnify or agree to indemnify any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation.

3.2.e.Other Requirements

The requirements of this Section 3.2 shall not apply to Incentive Compensation (1) received while SunTrust did not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association; and (2) received by an individual who did not serve as an Executive Officer of SunTrust any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation.

3.3Recoupment of Compensation Under Other Circumstances

3.3.a.Events Tracking

The SEIRC and the FIP Owners, shall monitor whether any of the circumstances described in either Section 3.1.a, Section 3.1.b, or Section 3.1.c occur with respect to any teammate (except Executive Officers) who received a Grant subject to Section 3.1 of this Policy.

3.3.b.Amounts to be Recouped

The Responsible Parties shall determine the amount of incentive compensation to recoup and, except for matters subject to Section 3.2, may consider the following:

(1)the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive compensation that otherwise would have been received but for the circumstances described in either Section 3.1;

(2)the cost or difficulty of obtaining recoupment, including but not limited to whether Grantee has any outstanding grants that may be cancelled, whether Grantee continues to be employed by SunTrust, and the language of this Recoupment Policy in effect on the relevant date of Grant;

(3)Grantee’s relative fault or degree of involvement, (including such factors as Grantee's current or former leadership role with respect to SunTrust or the relevant line of business, and the degree to which Grantee was involved in decisions that are determined to have contributed to the loss);

(4)Grantee's general performance;

(5)the impact of Grantee’s conduct on SunTrust, and the magnitude of any loss or variance from plan;

(6)other employment discipline that may have been applied; and

(7)any other relevant facts and circumstances.

3.4Method of Recoupment

SunTrust shall make this disclosure following the determination by the Compensation Committee promptly, either in its proxy statement for the annual election of directors, in a current report on Form 8-K or other public filing made by it with the SEC, or in a posting at a clearly identifiable location in the investor relations section of its corporate website. Notwithstanding the above, SunTrust may limit such disclosure if it would be likely to result in, or exacerbate, any existing or threatened, teammate, shareholder or other litigation, arbitration or proceeding against SunTrust or its officers or directors.

In addition to the foregoing, in the event that SunTrust is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement due to its material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under federal securities laws, then SunTrust shall disclose in any proxy or information statements that calls for SEC Regulation SK Item 402 disclosure, and its annual report on Form 10-K, the following information:

(5)if, during the last completed fiscal year SunTrust decided not to pursue Recoupment from any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer pursuant to Section 3.2(c) of this policy, then for each such Executive Officer SunTrust shall disclose the name and amount forgone and a brief description of the reason in each case SunTrust decided not to pursue recoupment.
