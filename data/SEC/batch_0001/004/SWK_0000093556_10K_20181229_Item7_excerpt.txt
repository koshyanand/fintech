Strategic Objectives

The Company continues to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy, which involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth, and employ the following strategic framework in pursuit of its vision to reach $22 billion in revenue by 2022 while expanding its margin rate ("22/22 Vision"):

•Continue organic growth momentum by utilizing the Stanley Fulfillment System ("SFS") 2.0 operating system, diversifying toward higher-growth, higher-margin businesses, and increasing the relative weighting of emerging markets; 

•Be selective and operate in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation, and global cost leadership is achievable; and

•Pursue acquisitive growth on multiple fronts by building upon its existing global tools platform, expanding the Industrial platform in Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure, consolidating the commercial electronic security industry, and pursuing adjacencies with sound industrial logic.

Execution of the above strategy has resulted in approximately $9.4 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (excluding the Black & Decker merger), several divestitures, improved efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing operations, and enhanced investments in organic growth, enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity. In addition, the Company's continued focus on diversification and organic growth has resulted in improved financial results and an increase in its global presence. The Company also remains focused on increasing its presence in emerging markets, with a goal of generating greater than 20% of annual revenues from those markets over time, and leveraging SFS 2.0 to upgrade innovation and digital capabilities, maintain commercial and supply chain excellence, and focus on reducing SG&A, in part, through functional transformation. Lastly, the Company continues to make strides towards achieving its 22/22 Vision by becoming known as one of the world’s leading innovators, delivering top-quartile financial performance and elevating its commitment to social responsibility.

The Company’s long-term financial objectives remain as follows:

•4-6% organic revenue growth;

•10-12% total revenue growth;

•10-12% total EPS growth (7-9% organically) excluding acquisition-related charges; 

•Free cash flow equal to, or exceeding, net income; and

•Sustain 10+ working capital turns.

In terms of capital allocation, the Company remains committed, over time, to returning approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through a strong and growing dividend as well as opportunistically repurchasing shares. The remaining free cash flow (approximately 50%) will be deployed towards acquisitions. 

24

The following represents recent examples of the Company executing its strategic objectives:

Acquisitions and Other Transactions

On January 2, 2019, the Company acquired a 20 percent interest in MTD Holdings Inc. ("MTD"), a privately held global manufacturer of outdoor power equipment, for $234 million in cash. With 2017 revenues of $2.4 billion, MTD manufactures and distributes gas-powered lawn tractors, zero turn mowers, walk behind mowers, snow throwers, trimmers, chain saws, utility vehicles and other outdoor power equipment. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company has the option to acquire the remaining 80 percent of MTD beginning on July 1, 2021 and ending on January 2, 2029. In the event the option is exercised, the companies have agreed to a valuation multiple based on MTD’s 2018 EBITDA, with an equitable sharing arrangement for future EBITDA growth. The investment in MTD increases the Company's presence in the $20 billion global lawn and garden segment and will allow the two companies to work together to pursue revenue and cost opportunities, improve operational efficiency, and introduce new and innovative products for professional and residential outdoor equipment customers, utilizing each company's respective portfolios of strong brands.

On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired Nelson Fastener Systems (“Nelson”) from the Doncasters Group for approximately $430 million. This acquisition is complementary to the Company's product offerings, enhances its presence in the general industrial end markets, expands its portfolio of highly-engineered fastening solutions, and will deliver cost synergies. The results of Nelson are being consolidated into the Industrial segment. 

On March 9, 2017, the Company acquired the Tools business of Newell Brands ("Newell Tools") for approximately $1.86 billion, which included the highly attractive industrial cutting, hand tool and power tool accessory brands IRWIN® and LENOX®. The acquisition enhanced the Company’s position within the global tools & storage industry and broadened the Company’s product offerings and solutions to customers and end-users, particularly within power tool accessories. The Newell Tools results have been consolidated into the Company's Tools & Storage segment.

On March 8, 2017, the Company purchased the Craftsman® brand from Sears Holdings Corporation (“Sears Holdings”) for an estimated cash purchase price of approximately $937 million on a discounted basis. The acquisition provided the Company with the rights to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman®-branded products in non-Sears Holdings channels. The Company plans to significantly increase the availability of Craftsman®-branded products to consumers in previously underpenetrated channels, enhance innovation, and add manufacturing jobs in the U.S. to support growth. The Craftsman results have been consolidated into the Company's Tools & Storage segment.

Pending Acquisition

On August 6, 2018, the Company reached an agreement to acquire International Equipment Solutions Attachments Group ("IES Attachments"), a manufacturer of high quality, performance-driven heavy equipment attachment tools for off-highway applications. On January 29, 2019, the agreement was amended to exclude the mobile processors business. The Company expects the acquisition to further diversify the Company's presence in the industrial markets, expand its portfolio of attachment solutions and provide a meaningful platform for continued growth. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

Refer to Note E, Acquisitions, for further discussion of the Company's acquisitions.

Divestitures

On February 22, 2017, the Company sold the majority of its mechanical security businesses, which included the commercial hardware brands of Best Access, phi Precision and GMT, for net proceeds of approximately $717 million. The sale allowed the Company to deploy capital in a more accretive and growth-oriented manner.

Refer to Note T, Divestitures, for further discussion of the Company's divestitures.

Certain Items Impacting Earnings

Throughout MD&A, the Company has provided a discussion of the outlook and results both inclusive and exclusive of acquisition-related charges, a non-cash fair value adjustment, gains or losses on sales of businesses, an environmental remediation settlement, charges associated with a cost reduction program, an incremental freight charge related to a service provider's bankruptcy, and tax charges primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the Act"). The results and measures, including gross profit and segment profit, on a basis excluding these amounts are considered relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results aside from the material impact of these items. These amounts are as follows:

25

2018

The Company reported $450 million in pre-tax charges during 2018, which were comprised of the following:

•$66 million reducing Gross Profit primarily pertaining to amortization of the inventory step-up adjustment for the Nelson acquisition and an incremental freight charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to nonperformance by a third-party service provider; 

•$158 million in SG&A primarily for integration-related costs, consulting fees, and a non-cash fair value adjustment;

•$108 million in Other, net primarily related to deal transaction costs and the settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA");

•$1 million related to a previously divested business; and

•$117 million in Restructuring charges which primarily related to a cost reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Company also recorded a net tax charge of $181 million, which is comprised of charges related to the Act partially offset by the tax benefit of the above pre-tax charges. The above amounts resulted in net after-tax charges of $631 million, or $4.16 per diluted share.

2017

The Company reported $156 million in pre-tax acquisition-related charges, which were comprised of the following:

•$47 million reducing Gross Profit primarily pertaining to amortization of the inventory step-up adjustment for the Newell Tools acquisition; 

•$38 million in SG&A primarily for integration-related costs and consulting fees;

•$58 million in Other, net primarily for deal transaction and consulting costs; and 

•$13 million in Restructuring charges pertaining to facility closures and employee severance.

The Company also reported a $264 million pre-tax gain on sales of businesses in 2017, primarily relating to the sale of the majority of the mechanical security businesses. The net tax benefit of the acquisition-related charges and gain on sales of businesses was $7 million. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $24 million net tax charge relating to the Act.

The acquisition-related charges, gain on sales of businesses, and net tax charge relating to the Act resulted in a net after-tax gain of $91 million, or $0.59 per diluted share.

Driving Further Profitable Growth by Fully Leveraging Our Core Franchises

Each of the Company's franchises share common attributes: they have world-class brands and attractive growth characteristics, they are scalable and defensible, they can differentiate through innovation, and they are powered by our SFS 2.0 operating system. 

•The Tools & Storage business is the tool company to own, with strong brands, proven innovation, global scale, and a broad offering of power tools, hand tools, accessories, and storage & digital products across many channels in both developed and developing markets.

•The Engineered Fastening business is a highly profitable, GDP+ growth business offering highly engineered, value-added innovative solutions with recurring revenue attributes and global scale.

•The Security business, with its attractive recurring revenue, presents a significant margin accretion opportunity over the longer term and has historically provided a stable revenue stream through economic cycles, is a gateway into the digital world and an avenue to capitalize on rapid digital changes. Security has embarked on a business transformation which will apply technology to lower its cost to serve and create new offerings for its small to medium enterprise and large key account customers.

While diversifying the business portfolio through strategic acquisitions remains important, management recognizes that the core franchises described above are important foundations that continue to provide strong cash flow and growth prospects. Management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development, brand support, continued investment in emerging markets and a sharp focus on global cost-competitiveness.

Continuing to Invest in the Stanley Black & Decker Brands

The Company has a strong portfolio of brands associated with high-quality products including STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER®, DEWALT®, FLEXVOLT®, IRWIN®, LENOX®, CRAFTSMAN®, PORTER-CABLE®, BOSTITCH®, PROTO®, MAC TOOLS®, FACOM®, AeroScout®, Powers®, LISTA®, SIDCHROME®, Vidmar®, SONITROL®, and GQ®. Among the Company's most valuable assets, the STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER® and DEWALT® brands are recognized as three of the world's great brands, while the CRAFTSMAN® brand is recognized as a premier American brand. 

During 2018, the STANLEY®, DEWALT® and CRAFTSMAN® brands had prominent signage in Major League Baseball ("MLB") stadiums appearing in many MLB games. The Company has also maintained long-standing NASCAR and NHRA racing sponsorships, which provided brand exposure during nearly 60 events in 2018 with the STANLEY®, DEWALT®, CRAFTSMAN®, IRWIN® and MAC TOOLS® brands. The Company also advertises in the English Premier League, which is the number one soccer league in the world, featuring STANLEY®, STANLEY Security, BLACK+DECKER® and DEWALT® brands to a global audience. Starting in 2014, the Company became a sponsor for one of the world’s most popular football clubs, FC Barcelona ("FCB"), including player image rights, hospitality assets and stadium signage. In 2018, the Company was announced as the first ever shirt sponsor for the FCB Women's team in support of its commitment to global diversity and inclusion. Also in 2018, the Company joined forces by sponsoring the Envision Virgin Racing Formula E team, in support of the Company's commitment to sustainability and the future of electric mobility. 

The above marketing initiatives highlight the Company's strong emphasis on brand building and support, which has resulted in more than 300 billion brand impressions via digital and traditional advertising annually and a steady improvement across the spectrum of brand awareness measures. The Company will continue allocating its brand and advertising spend wisely to capture the emerging digital landscape, whilst continuing to evolve proven marketing programs to deliver famous global brands that are deeply committed to societal improvement, along with transformative technologies to build relevant and meaningful 1:1 customer, consumer, employee and shareholder relationships in support of the Company's 22/22 Vision. 

The Stanley Fulfillment System and SFS 2.0

Over the years, the Company has successfully leveraged SFS to drive efficiency throughout the supply chain and improve working capital performance in order to generate incremental free cash flow. Historically, SFS focused on streamlining operations, which helped reduce lead times, realize synergies during acquisition integrations, and mitigate material and energy price inflation. In 2015, the Company launched a refreshed and revitalized SFS operating system, entitled SFS 2.0, to drive from a more programmatic growth mentality to a true organic growth culture by more deeply embedding breakthrough innovation and commercial excellence into its businesses, and at the same time, becoming a significantly more digitally-enabled enterprise.

Leveraging SFS 2.0, the Company is building a culture in which it strives to become known as one of the world’s great innovative companies by embracing the current environment of rapid innovation and digital transformation. To pursue faster innovation, the Company is building a vast ecosystem to remain aware of and open to new technologies and advances by leveraging both internal initiatives and external partnerships. The innovation ecosystem and focus on digital disruption will allow the Company to apply innovation to its core processes in manufacturing and back office functions to reduce operating costs and inefficiencies, develop core and breakthrough product innovations within each of its businesses, and pursue disruptive business models to either push into new markets or change existing business models before competition or new market entrants capture the opportunity. The Company has already made progress towards these objectives, as evidenced by the creation of breakthrough innovation teams in each business, the Stanley Ventures group, which invests capital in new and emerging start-ups in core focus areas, the Techstars partnership, which selects start-ups from around the world with the goal of bringing breakthrough manufacturing technologies to market, and a Silicon Valley based team, which is building its own set of disruptive initiatives and exploring new business models.

The Company has made a significant commitment to SFS 2.0 and management believes that its success will be characterized by continued organic growth in the 4-6% range as well as expanded operating margin rates over the next 3 to 5 years as the Company leverages the growth and reduces structural SG&A levels.

SFS 2.0 is transforming the Company by focusing its employees on the following five key pillars:

•Digital Excellence uses the power of digital to contemporize, be disruptive, and create value throughout the Company's array of products, processes and business models. Digital Excellence means leveraging the power of emerging technologies across the Company's businesses to connected devices, the Internet of Things ("IoT"), and big data, as well as social and mobile, even more than what is being done today. Digital is penetrating all aspects of the organization and feeds into and supports the other elements of SFS 2.0 - enabling better asset efficiency through Core 

27

SFS / Industry 4.0, greater cost effectiveness via the Company's support functions, and improving revenues and margins via customer-facing opportunities.

•Commercial Excellence is about how the Company becomes more effective and efficient in its customer-facing processes resulting in continued share gains and margin expansion throughout its businesses. The Company views Commercial Excellence as world-class execution across seven areas: customer insights, innovation and portfolio management, pricing and promotion, brand and marketing, sales force deployment and effectiveness, channel programs, and the customer experience.

•Breakthrough Innovation is aimed at developing a culture to identify and commercialize market disrupting innovations, each with revenue generation potential greater than $100 million annually. The Company's focus remains on utilizing technologies to come up with major breakthroughs in the industries in which the Company operates which, when combined with its existing strong core innovation machine, will drive outsized share gains and margin expansion.

•Core SFS / Industry 4.0, which targets cost and asset efficiency, remains as the foundation for the Company's operating system and has yielded significant advances in improving working capital turns and free cash flow generation. The five operating principles encompassed by Core SFS / Industry 4.0, which work in concert, include: sales and operations planning ("S&OP"), operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order-to-cash excellence. The Company plans to continue leveraging these principles to further enhance the Company's already strong asset efficiency performance. Additionally, the Company is making investments behind the adoption of Industry 4.0 and advancing the Company's capabilities surrounding the automation of manufacturing that includes IoT, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence ("AI"), 3-D printing, robotics, and advanced materials, among others.

•Functional Transformation takes a clean-sheet approach to redesigning the Company's key support functions such as Finance, HR, IT and others, which although highly effective, after roughly a hundred acquisitions are not as efficient as they can be based on external benchmarks. This presents the Company with an opportunity to reduce complexity in order to realize the benefits from scale, reduce its SG&A as a percent of sales, and become a cost effectiveness enabler with the side benefit of helping to fund the other aspects of SFS 2.0 over the long term and to support margin expansion.

SFS 2.0 will serve as a powerful value driver in the years ahead, feeding the Company's innovation ecosystem, embracing outstanding commercial and supply chain excellence, embedding digital into the various business models, and funding it with world-class functional efficiency. Taken together, the five pillars above will directly support achievement of the Company's long-term financial objectives, including its 22/22 Vision, and further enable its shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach, which has served the Company well in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

Outlook for 2019

This outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the Company’s near-term earnings and cash flow generation prospects. The Company expects 2019 diluted earnings per share to approximate $7.45 to $7.65 ($8.45 to $8.65 excluding acquisition-related and other charges), and free cash flow conversion, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, to approximate 85% to 90%. The 2019 outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes approximately $0.30 to $0.40 of accretion related to organic sales volume growth; approximately $1.05 of accretion due to the benefit from the cost reduction program partially offset by modest investments; approximately $0.10 of accretion related to the benefits from the MTD partnership and lower shares partially offset by higher interest expense; approximately $0.90 to $1.00 of dilution from incremental tariffs, commodity inflation, and currency partially offset by pricing actions; and approximately $0.15 of dilution due to an expected tax rate of approximately 17.5%.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Below is a summary of the Company’s operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business segment performance. Certain amounts reported in the previous years have been recast as a result of the retrospective adoption of new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion.

Terminology: The term “organic” is utilized to describe results aside from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership, and divestitures. This ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

Net Sales: Net sales were $13.982 billion in 2018 compared to $12.967 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 8% with strong organic growth of 5%. Acquisitions, primarily Newell Tools and Nelson, increased sales by 3%. Tools & Storage net sales increased 9% compared to 2017 due to strong organic growth of 7%, fueled by solid growth across all regions, and acquisition growth of 2%. Industrial net sales increased 11% compared to 2017 primarily due to acquisition growth of 9% and favorable currency of 2%. Security net sales increased 2% compared to 2017 due to increases of 1% in price, 3% in small bolt-on commercial electronic security acquisitions and 1% in foreign currency, partially offset by declines of 1% from the sale of the majority of the mechanical security businesses and 2% from lower volumes. 

Net sales were $12.967 billion in 2017 compared to $11.594 billion in 2016, representing an increase of 12% fueled by strong organic growth of 7%. Acquisitions, primarily Newell Tools, and foreign currency increased sales by 7% and 1%, respectively, while the impact of divestitures decreased sales by 3%. Tools & Storage net sales increased 19% compared to 2016 due to strong innovation-fueled organic growth of 9%, with solid growth across all regions, and acquisition growth of 10%. Industrial net sales increased 6% relative to 2016 due to a 6% increase in sales volume, which was mainly driven by strong automotive system shipments in the Engineered Fastening business and successful commercial actions and higher inspection and onshore pipeline project activity in the Infrastructure business. Net sales in the Security segment decreased 8% compared to 2016 primarily due to a 12% decline from the sale of the majority of the mechanical security businesses, which more than offset increases from organic growth and small bolt-on commercial electronic security acquisitions of 1% and 3%, respectively.

Gross Profit: The Company reported gross profit of $4.851 billion, or 34.7% of net sales, in 2018 compared to $4.778 billion, or 36.9% of net sales, in 2017. Acquisition-related and other charges, which reduced gross profit, were $65.7 million in 2018 and $46.8 million in 2017. Excluding these charges, gross profit was 35.2% of net sales in 2018, compared to 37.2% in 2017, as volume leverage, productivity and price were more than offset by external headwinds, including commodity inflation, foreign exchange and tariffs. 

The Company reported gross profit of $4.778 billion, or 36.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $4.268 billion, or 36.8% of net sales, in 2016. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $46.8 million, which primarily related to the amortization of the inventory step-up adjustment for the Newell Tools acquisition, gross profit was 37.2% of net sales in 2017. The year-over-year increase in the profit rate was attributable to volume leverage, productivity and cost control, which more than offset increasing commodity inflation and the impact from the mechanical security business divestiture.

SG&A Expense: Selling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts (“SG&A”), were $3.172 billion, or 22.7% of net sales, in 2018 compared to $2.999 billion, or 23.1% of net sales, in 2017. Within SG&A, acquisition-related and other charges totaled $157.8 million in 2018 and $37.7 million in 2017. Excluding these charges, SG&A was 21.6% of net sales in 2018 compared to 22.8% in 2017, due primarily to prudent cost management and volume leverage. 

SG&A expenses were $2.999 billion, or 23.1% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $2.633 billion, or 22.7% of net sales, in 2016. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $37.7 million, SG&A was 22.8% of net sales in 2017. The slight year-over-year increase was driven by investments in growth initiatives partially offset by continued tight cost management. 

Distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within SG&A. This classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. Due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the Company’s gross margins may not be comparable. Such distribution costs classified in SG&A amounted to $316.0 million in 2018, $279.8 million in 2017 and $235.3 million in 2016. 

Corporate Overhead: The corporate overhead element of SG&A, which is not allocated to the business segments, amounted to $202.8 million, or 1.5% of net sales, in 2018, $217.4 million, or 1.7% of net sales, in 2017 and $190.9 million, or 1.6% of net sales, in 2016. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $12.7 million and $0.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, the corporate overhead element of SG&A was 1.4% of net sales in 2018 compared to 1.7% of net sales in 2017 reflecting cost management. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to investments in SFS 2.0 initiatives. 

29

Other, net: Other, net totaled $287.0 million in 2018 compared to $269.2 million in 2017 and $185.9 million in 2016. Excluding the aforementioned EPA settlement charge and acquisition-related charges which totaled $108.1 million in 2018 and acquisition-related charges of $58.2 million in 2017, Other, net totaled $178.9 million and $211.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in 2018 was driven by an environmental remediation charge of $17 million in 2017 relating to a legacy Black & Decker site and a favorable resolution of a prior claim in 2018, which more than offset higher intangible amortization expense in 2018. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by higher amortization expense related to the 2017 acquisitions, negative impacts of foreign currency and the environmental remediation charge of $17 million discussed above. 

Refer to Note S, Contingencies, for additional information regarding the EPA settlement discussed above.

Loss (Gain) on Sales of Businesses: During 2018, the Company reported a $0.8 million pre-tax loss relating to a previously divested business. During 2017, the Company reported a $264.1 million pre-tax gain primarily relating to the sale of the majority of the Company's mechanical security businesses, as previously discussed.

Pension Settlement: Pension settlement of $12.2 million in 2017 reflects losses previously reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to a non-U.S. pension plan for which the Company settled its obligation by purchasing an annuity and making lump sum payments to participants.

Interest, net: Net interest expense in 2018 was $209.2 million compared to $182.5 million in 2017 and $171.3 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average balances relating to the Company's U.S. commercial paper borrowings partially offset by higher interest income. The increase in net interest expense in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to the termination of interest rate swaps in June 2016 hedging the Company's fixed rate debt. 

Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate was 40.7% in 2018, 19.7% in 2017, and 21.3% in 2016. The 2018 effective tax rate includes net charges associated with the Act, which primarily related to the re-measurement of existing deferred tax balances, adjustments to the one-time transition tax, and the provision of deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings and profits for which the Company no longer asserts indefinite reinvestment. Excluding the impacts of the net charge related to the Act as well as the acquisition-related and other charges previously discussed, the effective tax rate in 2018 was 16.0%. This effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a portion of the Company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions and the favorable effective settlements of income tax audits. 

The 2017 effective tax rate included a one-time net charge relating to the provisional amounts recorded associated with the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017. The net charge primarily related to the re-measurement of existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. Excluding the impact of the divestitures, acquisition-related charges, and the net charge related to the Act, the effective tax rate was 20.0% in 2017. This effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the Company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, the favorable settlement of certain income tax audits, and the acceleration of certain tax credits resulting in a tax benefit. The effective tax rate in 2016 differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the Company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, adjustments to tax positions relating to undistributed foreign earnings, and reversals of valuation allowances for certain foreign and U.S. state net operating losses, which had become realizable. 

Business Segment Results

The Company’s reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. The Company utilizes segment profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and SG&A inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts (aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment. Segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of SG&A, other, net (inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense), loss (gain) on sales of businesses, pension settlement, restructuring charges and asset impairments, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes. Corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive management team and expenses pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire Company but are not directly attributable to the businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. Refer to Note F, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, and Note O, Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments, for the amount of intangible asset amortization expense and net restructuring charges and asset impairments, respectively, attributable to each segment. 

30

The Company classifies its business into three reportable segments, which also represent its operating segments: Tools & Storage, Industrial and Security. 

Tools & Storage:

The Tools & Storage segment is comprised of the Power Tools & Equipment ("PTE") and Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage ("HTAS") businesses. The PTE business includes both professional and consumer products. Professional products include professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders, as well as pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers and staples, concrete and masonry anchors. Consumer products include corded and cordless electric power tools sold primarily under the BLACK+DECKER® brand, lawn and garden products, including hedge trimmers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, edgers and related accessories, and home products such as hand-held vacuums, paint tools and cleaning appliances. The HTAS business sells hand tools, power tool accessories and storage products. Hand tools include measuring, leveling and layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, clamps, vises, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. Power tool accessories include drill bits, screwdriver bits, router bits, abrasives, saw blades and threading products. Storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Tools & Storage net sales increased $769.0 million, or 9%, in 2018 compared to 2017. Organic sales increased 7%, with a 6% increase in volume and 1% increase in price, reflecting strong growth in each of the regions, and acquisitions, primarily Newell Tools, increased net sales by 2%. North America growth was driven by new product innovation, the rollout of the Craftsman brand and price realization. Europe growth was supported by new products and successful commercial actions. The growth in emerging markets was driven by mid-price-point product releases, e-commerce strategies and pricing actions. 

Segment profit amounted to $1.393 billion, or 14.2% of net sales, in 2018 compared to $1.439 billion, or 15.9% of net sales, in 2017. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $142.6 million and $81.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, segment profit amounted to 15.6% of net sales in 2018 compared to 16.8% in 2017, as the benefits from volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by the impacts from currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. 

Tools & Storage net sales increased $1.426 billion, or 19%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Organic sales increased 9%, with strong organic growth in each of the regions, and acquisitions, primarily Newell, increased net sales by 10%. North America growth was supported by share gains from strong commercial execution and market-leading innovation, including sales from the FLEXVOLT® system, as well as a healthy U.S. tool market. Europe delivered above-market organic growth enabled by successful commercial actions and new product launches. The strong organic growth in emerging markets was supported by mid-price-point product releases, higher e-commerce volumes and strong commercial execution. Foreign currency increased sales by 1% while the sales of two small businesses in 2017 resulted in a 1% decrease. 

Segment profit amounted to $1.439 billion, or 15.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $1.258 billion, or 16.5% of net sales, in 2016. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $81.8 million, segment profit amounted to 16.8% of net sales in 2017 compared to 16.5% in 2016, as volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments and increased commodity inflation. 

Industrial:

The Industrial segment is comprised of the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure businesses. The Engineered Fastening business primarily sells engineered fastening products and systems designed for specific applications. The product lines include blind rivets and tools, blind inserts and tools, drawn arc weld studs and systems, engineered plastic and mechanical fasteners, self-piercing riveting systems, precision nut running systems, micro fasteners, and high-strength structural fasteners. The Infrastructure business consists of the Oil & Gas and Hydraulics businesses. The Oil & Gas business sells and rents custom pipe handling, joint welding and coating equipment used in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines, and provides pipeline inspection services. The Hydraulics business sells hydraulic tools and accessories. 

31

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Industrial net sales increased $213.5 million, or 11%, in 2018 compared to 2017, due to acquisition growth of 9% and favorable foreign currency of 2%. Engineered Fastening organic revenues increased 1% due primarily to industrial and automotive fastener penetration gains which were partially offset by the expected impact from lower automotive system shipments. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 1% due to anticipated lower pipeline project activity in the Oil & Gas business, partially offset by volume growth within the Hydraulics business. 

Segment profit totaled $319.8 million, or 14.6% of net sales, in 2018 compared to $345.9 million, or 17.5% of net sales, in 2017. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $26.0 million in 2018, segment profit amounted to 15.8% of net sales in 2018 compared to 17.5% in 2017, as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and the modestly dilutive impact from the Nelson acquisition.

Industrial net sales increased $110.3 million, or 6%, in 2017 compared to 2016, due to a 6% increase in organic sales. Engineered Fastening organic sales increased 4% as strong automotive system shipments and volume growth in general industrial markets more than offset lower volumes within electronics. Infrastructure organic sales increased 12% due to successful commercial actions and improved market conditions in the Hydraulics business and higher inspection and North American onshore pipeline project activity in the Oil & Gas business.

Segment profit totaled $345.9 million, or 17.5% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $300.1 million, or 16.1% of net sales, in 2016. The year-over-year increase in segment profit rate was primarily due to volume leverage, productivity gains and cost control.

Security: 

The Security segment is comprised of the Convergent Security Solutions ("CSS") and the Mechanical Access Solutions ("MAS") businesses. The CSS business designs, supplies and installs commercial electronic security systems and provides electronic security services, including alarm monitoring, video surveillance, fire alarm monitoring, systems integration and system maintenance. Purchasers of these systems typically contract for ongoing security systems monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. The business also sells healthcare solutions, which include asset tracking, infant protection, pediatric protection, patient protection, wander management, fall management, and emergency call products. The MAS business primarily sells automatic doors. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Security net sales increased $33.3 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increases of 1% in price, 3% in small bolt-on commercial electronic security acquisitions and 1% in foreign currency, partially offset by declines of 1% from the sale of the majority of the mechanical security businesses and 2% from lower volumes. Organic sales for North America decreased 1% as higher volumes within automatic doors were offset by lower installations in commercial electronic security. Europe declined 1% organically as strength within the Nordics was offset by weakness in the U.K. and France. 

Segment profit amounted to $169.3 million, or 8.5% of net sales, in 2018 compared to $211.7 million, or 10.9% of net sales, in 2017. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $42.2 million and $2.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, segment profit amounted to 10.7% of net sales in 2018 compared to 11.0% in 2017. The year-over-year change in segment profit rate reflects investments to support business transformation in commercial electronic security and the impact from the sale of the majority of the mechanical security business, partially offset by a continued focus on cost containment.

Security net sales decreased $163.0 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a 12% decline from the sale of the majority of the mechanical security businesses. Organic sales and small bolt-on commercial electronic security acquisitions provided increases of 1% and 3%, respectively. North America organic sales increased 2% on higher installation volumes within the commercial electronic security and automatic doors businesses and growth within healthcare. Europe organic growth was relatively flat as strength within the U.K. and the Nordics was mostly offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. 

32

Segment profit amounted to $211.7 million, or 10.9% of net sales, in 2017 compared to $267.9 million, or 12.7% of net sales, in 2016. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $2.0 million in 2017, segment profit amounted to 11.0% of net sales in 2017 compared to 12.7% in 2016. The decrease in the 2017 segment profit rate reflected an approximate 90 basis point decline related to the sale of the mechanical security businesses, as well as impacts from mix and funding growth investments.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES 

A summary of the restructuring reserve activity from December 30, 2017 to December 29, 2018 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During 2018, the Company recognized net restructuring charges and asset impairments of $160.3 million, which primarily relates to the cost reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2018. This amount reflects $151.0 million of net severance charges associated with the reduction of 4,184 employees and $9.3 million of facility closure and other restructuring costs. The Company expects the 2018 actions to result in annual net cost savings of approximately $230 million by the end of 2019.

The majority of the $108.8 million of reserves remaining as of December 29, 2018 is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months.

During 2017, the Company recognized net restructuring charges and asset impairments of $51.5 million. This amount reflected $40.6 million of net severance charges associated with the reduction of 1,584 employees and $10.9 million of facility closure and other restructuring costs. The 2017 actions resulted in annual net cost savings of approximately $45 million in 2018, primarily in the Tools & Storage and Security segments.

During 2016, the Company recognized net restructuring charges and asset impairments of $49.0 million. This amount reflected $27.3 million of net severance charges associated with the reduction of 1,326 employees. The Company also recognized $11.0 million of facility closure costs and $10.7 million of asset impairments. The 2016 actions resulted in annual net cost savings of approximately $20 million in each segment.

Segments: The $160 million of net restructuring charges and asset impairments for the year ended December 29, 2018 includes: $80 million pertaining to the Tools & Storage segment; $30 million pertaining to the Industrial segment; $36 million pertaining to the Security segment; and $14 million pertaining to Corporate.

The anticipated annual net cost savings of approximately $230 million related to the 2018 restructuring actions include: $115 million pertaining to the Tools & Storage segment; $30 million pertaining to the Industrial segment; $55 million relating to the Security segment; and $30 million relating to Corporate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital: The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities. Below is a summary of the Company’s cash flow results. Certain amounts reported in the previous years have been recast as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion.

Operating Activities: Cash flows provided by operations were $1.261 billion in 2018 compared to $669 million in 2017. As discussed further in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, operating cash flows in 2017 have decreased by approximately $750 million as a result of the retrospective adoption of new cash flow standards in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of the new standards, cash flows provided by operations in 2018 decreased year-over-year primarily due to higher income tax payments and higher payments associated with acquisition-related and other charges. 

In 2017, cash flows from operations were $669 million compared to $1.186 billion in 2016. Excluding the impacts of the new cash flow standards described above, operating cash flows in 2017 decreased slightly compared to 2016 due primarily to higher cash outflows from working capital to support outsized organic growth in the Tools & Storage segment, partially offset by higher earnings excluding the impacts of non-cash items (gain on sales of businesses and amortization of inventory step-up).

Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow, as defined in the table below, was $769 million in 2018 compared to $226 million in 2017 and $839 million in 2016. Excluding the retrospective impacts of the previously discussed new cash flow standards adopted in the first quarter of 2018, free cash flow totaled $976 million in 2017 and $1.138 billion in 2016. Management considers free cash 

33

flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide dividends to shareowners. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company’s common stock and business acquisitions, among other items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Certain amounts reported in the previous years have been recast as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2018. Refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion. 

Investing Activities: Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $989 million in 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions of $525 million, mainly related to the Nelson acquisition, and capital and software expenditures of $492 million. The increase in capital and software expenditures in 2018 was primarily due to technology-related and capacity investments to support the Company's strong organic growth and its SFS 2.0 initiatives.

Cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 totaled $1.567 billion, which primarily consisted of business acquisitions of $2.584 billion, mainly related to the Newell Tools and Craftsman acquisitions, and capital and software expenditures of $443 million, partially offset by proceeds of $757 million from sales of businesses and $705 million from the deferred purchase price receivable related to an accounts receivable sales program, which was terminated in February 2018. The increase in capital and software expenditures in 2017 was due to growth in the Company's supply chain and investments related to functional transformation. 

Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 totaled $61 million, which primarily consisted of $345 million of proceeds from the deferred purchase price receivable related to the terminated accounts receivable sales program discussed above and net investment hedge settlements of $105 million, partially offset by capital and software expenditures of $347 million. The proceeds from net investment hedge settlements were primarily driven by the significant fluctuations in foreign currency rates during 2016 associated with foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of the Company's pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro denominated net investments.

Financing Activities: Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $562 million in 2018 due primarily to the repurchase of common shares for $527 million and cash dividend payments of $385 million, partially offset by $433 million of net proceeds from short-term borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program.

Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $295 million in 2017 primarily due to $726 million in proceeds from the issuance of equity units, partially offset by $363 million of cash payments for dividends and $77 million of net repayments of short-term borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. 

Cash flows used in financing activities in 2016 totaled $433 million, primarily due to share repurchases of $374 million, cash payments for dividends of $331 million, and the settlement of the October 2014 forward share purchase contract for $147 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock of $419 million, which mainly related to the issuance of 3.5 million shares associated with the settlement of the 2013 Equity Purchase Contracts.

Fluctuations in foreign currency rates negatively impacted cash by $54 million in 2018 due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Company's other currencies. Foreign currency positively impacted cash by $81 million in 2017 and negatively impacted cash by $102 million in 2016 due to movements in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies. 

Refer to Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, and Note J, Capital Stock, for further discussion regarding the Company's debt and equity arrangements.

Credit Ratings and Liquidity:

The Company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major U.S. rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt (S&P A, Fitch A-, Moody's Baa1), as well as its commercial paper program (S&P A-1, Fitch F2, Moody's P-2). There have been no changes to any of the ratings during 2018.  Failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the Company’s cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access its existing committed credit facilities. 

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $289 million as of December 29, 2018, comprised of $60 million in the U.S. and $229 million in foreign jurisdictions. As of December 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $638 million, comprised of $54 million in the U.S. and $584 million in foreign jurisdictions. 

34

As a result of the Act, the Company's tax liability related to the one-time transition tax associated with unremitted foreign earnings and profits totaled $366 million at December 29, 2018. The Act permits a U.S. company to elect to pay the net tax liability interest-free over a period of up to eight years. See the Contractual Obligations table below for the estimated amounts due by period. The Company has considered the implications of paying the required one-time transition tax, and believes it will not have a material impact on its liquidity. Refer to Note Q, Income Taxes, for further discussion of the impacts of the Act.

In November 2018, the Company issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, maturing on November 15, 2028 ("2028 Term Notes") and $500 million of senior unsecured notes, maturing on November 15, 2048 ("2048 Term Notes"). The 2028 Term Notes and 2048 Term Notes will accrue interest at fixed rates of 4.25% per annum and 4.85% per annum, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on both notes. The notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Company received net proceeds of $990.0 million which reflects a discount of $0.9 million and $9.1 million of underwriting expenses and other fees associated with the transaction. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including repayment of other borrowings. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2028 Term Notes and 2048 Term Notes, the Company paid $977.5 million to settle its remaining obligations of two unsecured notes that matured in November 2018, which related to the Equity Units issued in December 2013 and the Convertible Preferred Units issued in November 2010. Refer to Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further discussion of these arrangements. 

In May 2017, the Company issued 7,500,000 Equity Units with a total notional value of $750.0 million ("$750 million Equity Units"). Each unit has a stated amount of $100 and initially consisted of a three-year forward stock purchase contract ("2020 Purchase Contracts") for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on May 15, 2020, for a price of $100, and a 10% beneficial ownership interest in one share of 0% Series C Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share ("Series C Preferred Stock"). The Company received approximately $726 million in cash proceeds from the $750 million Equity Units, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses, and issued 750,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, recording $750.0 million in preferred stock. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term borrowings. The Company also used $25.1 million of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions utilized to hedge potential economic dilution. On and after May 15, 2020, the Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into common stock at the option of the holder. At the election of the Company, upon conversion, the Company may deliver cash, common stock, or a combination thereof. On or after June 22, 2020, the Company may elect to redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. If the Company calls the Series C Preferred Stock for redemption, holders may convert their shares immediately preceding the redemption date. Upon settlement of the 2020 Purchase Contracts, the Company will receive additional cash proceeds of $750 million. The Company will pay the holders of the 2020 Purchase Contracts quarterly contract adjustment payments, which commenced in August 2017. As of December 29, 2018, the present value of the contract adjustment payments was $58.8 million.

In January 2017, the Company amended its existing $2.0 billion commercial paper program to increase the maximum amount of notes authorized to be issued to $3.0 billion and to include Euro denominated borrowings in addition to U.S. Dollars. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had $373.0 million of borrowings outstanding against the Company's $3.0 billion commercial paper program, of which approximately $228.9 million in Euro denominated commercial paper was designated as a Net Investment Hedge as described in more detailed in Note I, Financial Instruments. At December 30, 2017, the Company had no borrowings outstanding against the Company’s $3.0 billion commercial paper program. 

In September 2018, the Company amended and restated its existing five-year $1.75 billion committed credit facility with the concurrent execution of a new five-year $2.0 billion committed credit facility (the "5 Year Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros or Pounds Sterling. A sub-limit of $653.3 million is designated for swing line advances which may be drawn in Euros pursuant to the terms of the 5 Year Credit Agreement. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing and specific terms of the 5 Year Credit Agreement. The Company must repay all advances under the 5 Year Credit Agreement by the earlier of September 12, 2023 or upon termination. The 5 Year Credit Agreement is designated to be a liquidity back-stop for the Company's $3.0 billion U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the Company had not drawn on its five-year committed credit facility.

In September 2018, the Company terminated its previous 364-day $1.25 billion committed credit facility and concurrently executed a new 364-Day $1.0 billion committed credit facility (the "364 Day Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the 364 Day Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars or Euros and bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing and pursuant to the terms of the 364 Day Credit Agreement. The Company must repay all advances under the 364 Day Credit Agreement by the earlier of September 11, 2019 or upon termination. The 

35

Company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination, into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first anniversary of the termination date, provided that the Company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. The 364 Day Credit Agreement serves as a liquidity back-stop for the Company's $3.0 billion U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had not drawn on its 364-Day committed credit facility.

In addition, the Company has other short-term lines of credit that are primarily uncommitted, with numerous banks, aggregating $455.4 million, of which $357.8 million was available at December 29, 2018. Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal.

At December 29, 2018, the aggregate amount of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, long-term and short-term, was $3.5 billion. At December 29, 2018, $376.1 million was recorded as short-term borrowings relating to commercial paper and amounts outstanding against uncommitted lines. In addition, $97.6 million of the short-term credit lines was utilized primarily pertaining to outstanding letters of credit for which there are no required or reported debt balances. The weighted-average interest rates on U.S. dollar denominated short-term borrowings for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were 2.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on Euro denominated short-term borrowings for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was negative 0.3%.

In March 2015, the Company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty for 3,645,510 shares of common stock. The contract obligates the Company to pay $350.0 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. In June 2018, the Company amended the settlement date to April 2021, or earlier at the Company's option.

In December 2013, the Company issued $400.0 million 5.75% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures maturing December 15, 2053 (“2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures”) that bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum, up to, but excluding December 15, 2018. From and including December 15, 2018, the 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 4.304%. The debentures subordination and long tenor provides significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and as a result, the debentures were awarded a 50% equity credit by S&P and Fitch, and 25% equity credit by Moody's. The net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay commercial paper borrowings. On February 25, 2019, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures for $405.7 million, which represented 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

Refer to Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, and Note J, Capital Stock, for further discussion regarding the Company's debt and equity arrangements.

Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

36

(a)Future payments on long-term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities, excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long-term debt. As previously discussed, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures on February 25, 2019. Accordingly, the payment related to the redemption has been reflected in 2019 in the table above. Refer to Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further discussion.

(b)Future interest payments on long-term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or variable rate for floating rate debt in effect at December 29, 2018. In addition, interest payments related to the 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures have been adjusted accordingly as a result of the February 25, 2019 redemption discussed in (a) above.

(c)Inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials, components, and sourced products.

(d)Future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value and accrued interest as of December 29, 2018. The ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ, perhaps significantly, based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity.

(e)In March 2015, the Company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty which obligates the Company to pay $350 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. In June 2018, the Company amended the settlement date to April 2021, or earlier at the Company's option. See Note J, Capital Stock, for further discussion.

(f)This amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. The Company has not presented estimated pension and post-retirement funding beyond 2019 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions.

(g)These amounts represent future contract adjustment payments to holders of the Company's 2020 Purchase Contracts. See Note J, Capital Stock, for further discussion.

(h)The Company acquired the Craftsman® brand from Sears Holdings in March 2017. As part of the purchase price, the Company is obligated to pay $250 million in March 2020. See Note E, Acquisitions, for further discussion.

(i)Income tax liability for the one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits. See Note Q, Income Taxes, for further discussion.

To the extent the Company can reliably determine when payments will occur, the related amounts will be included in the table above. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the contingent consideration liability related to the Craftsman acquisition and the unrecognized tax liabilities of $169 million and $460 million, respectively, at December 29, 2018, the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) these amounts may be paid. Refer to Note E, Acquisitions, Note M, Fair Value Measurements, and Note Q, Income Taxes, for further discussion.

Payments of the above contractual obligations (with the exception of payments related to debt principal, the forward stock purchase contract, contract adjustment fees, the March 2020 purchase price, and tax obligations) will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above.

Short-term borrowings, long-term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within Note H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements.

MARKET RISK 

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, bond prices and commodity prices, amongst others.

Exposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) and the Taiwan Dollar. Certain cross-currency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options, purchased options, collars, cross-currency swaps and currency forwards. The Company is thus able 

37

to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. At times, the Company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables, primarily for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures. Management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un-hedged. The Company may also enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. Management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2018 would have been an incremental pre-tax loss of approximately $52 million based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions. The Company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. The Company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-U.S. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods.

As mentioned above, the Company routinely has cross-border trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. The Company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies. It is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. Aside from the use of derivative instruments, which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the Company may take. For example, if an exposure occurs from a European entity sourcing product from a U.S. supplier it may be possible to change to a European supplier. Management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact, on pre-tax earnings, of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $174 million, or approximately $0.96 per diluted share. In 2018, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings by approximately $100.0 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.55. 

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations, short-term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps.

The Company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the U.S. which is based on LIBOR rates. At December 29, 2018, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the Company’s floating rate debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

The Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects. 

Fluctuations in the fair value of the Company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") section of MD&A. Additionally, the Company has $85 million of liabilities as of December 29, 2018 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain U.S. employees for which there is mark-to-market exposure.

The assets held by the Company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. The funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding would occur over a period of many years. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a $72 million decrease, a $217 million increase, and a $260 million increase, respectively. The Company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately $44 million in 2019. The Company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. Management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate.

The Company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating.

The Company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal. Accordingly, based on present conditions and past history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur. The Company believes that its strong financial position, operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ability to access equity markets, provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of 

38

annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings.

OTHER MATTERS

Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") — As detailed in Note L, Employee Benefit Plans, the Company has an ESOP under which the ongoing U.S. Core and 401(k) defined contribution plans are funded. Overall ESOP expense is affected by the market value of the Company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released, among other factors. The Company’s net ESOP activity resulted in expense of $0.4 million in 2018, income of $1.3 million in 2017, and expense of $3.1 million in 2016. ESOP expense could increase in the future if the market value of the Company’s common stock declines. In addition, ESOP expense will increase once all remaining unallocated shares are released, which could occur as early as 2019. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES — Preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — The Company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods. The amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved. First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. In these cases, management uses its judgment, based on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. Second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection and write-off experience.

If circumstances change, for example, due to the occurrence of higher-than-expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the Company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced.

INVENTORIES — Inventories in the U.S. are primarily valued at the lower of Last-In First-Out (“LIFO”) cost or market, while non-U.S. inventories are primarily valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) cost and net realizable value. The calculation of LIFO reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. The Company continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units (“SKUs”) to determine that these items are properly valued. The Company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories. Inventory items identified as obsolete and/or slow-moving are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required. The Company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost. If it is determined that cost is less than market or net realizable value, as applicable, cost is used for inventory valuation. If market value or net realizable value, as applicable, is less than cost, the Company writes down the related inventory to that value. 

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20, Goodwill, acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. At December 29, 2018, the Company reported $8.957 billion of goodwill, $2.199 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and $1.286 billion of net definite-lived intangibles. 

Management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting, or one level below an operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its estimated fair value, an impairment may exist. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value.

39

As required by the Company’s policy, goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2018. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to assess impairment. Such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the Company’s reporting units. Accordingly, for its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2018, the Company applied the qualitative assessment for two of its reporting units, while performing the quantitative test for three of its reporting units. Based on the results of this testing, the Company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. 

In performing the qualitative assessments, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit. These factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. The Company also assessed changes in each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed. As a result of the qualitative assessments performed, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore, no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed.

With respect to the quantitative tests, the Company assessed the fair values of the three reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates, which ranged from 8.0% to 9.5%, near-term revenue growth rates over the next five years, which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 5% to 8%, and perpetual growth rates of 3%. These assumptions contemplated business, market and overall economic conditions. Based on the results of this testing, the Company determined that the fair values of each of the three reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. Furthermore, management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate. The discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. The perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated. 

The Company also tested its indefinite-lived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2018 utilizing a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used included discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. Based on these quantitative impairment tests, the Company determined that the fair values of the indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts.

In the event that future operating results of any of the Company's reporting units or indefinite-lived trade names do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions, as necessary, to maximize revenue growth and profitability. A thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate.

DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS — The valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions, which are updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost trend rates. The Company considers current market conditions, including interest rates, to establish these assumptions. Discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations. The Company’s weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at December 29, 2018 for the United States and international pension plans were 4.20% and 2.62%, respectively. The Company’s weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at December 30, 2017 for the United States and international pension plans were 3.53% and 2.24%, respectively. As discussed further in Note L, Employee Benefit Plans, the Company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors, which include its targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. The Company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the United States and international pension plans were 6.25% and 4.37%, respectively, at December 29, 2018. The Company will use a 5.51% weighted-average expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2019 net periodic benefit cost. A 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2019 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $5 million on a pre-tax basis.

The Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. To the extent that actual (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions, the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized over future periods. The expected return on plan assets is determined using 

40

the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets. Accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year. The projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $616 million at December 29, 2018. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $81 million at December 29, 2018. The primary Black & Decker U.S. pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material Black & Decker international plan, and in their place the Company implemented defined contribution benefit plans. The vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions. The Company recognized $4 million of defined benefit plan income in 2018, which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.

ENVIRONMENTAL — The Company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available.

As of December 29, 2018, the Company had reserves of $246.6 million for remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $214.0 million to $344.3 million which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy.

INCOME TAXES — The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards. In the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. Conversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made.

The Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. 

The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires a two-step process. First, management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second, for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority. The Company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes. Many factors are considered when evaluating 

41

and estimating the Company's tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the Company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty.

Additional information regarding income taxes is available in Note Q, Income Taxes.

RISK INSURANCE — To manage its insurance costs efficiently, the Company self insures for certain U.S. business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally. For domestic workers’ compensation, automobile and product liability (liability for alleged injuries associated with the Company’s products), the Company generally purchases insurance coverage only for severe losses that are unlikely, and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates. While different self insured retentions, in the form of deductibles and self insurance through its captive insurance company, exist for each of these lines of insurance, the maximum self insured retention is set at no more than $5 million per occurrence. The process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value. The cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a period of approximately 14 years. The Company believes the liabilities recorded for these U.S. risk insurance reserves, totaling $86 million and $87 million as of December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively, are adequate. Due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.

WARRANTY — The Company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses. The types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime, and certain branded products recently acquired carry a lifetime warranty. There are also certain products with no warranty. Further, the Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available. The Company believes the $102 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of December 29, 2018 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims, the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability. The Company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product-specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company-initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT

SYNTHETIC LEASES — The Company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for certain locations, including one of its major distribution centers and two of its office buildings. The programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where only the monthly lease expense is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off-balance sheet.

These lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. The cash outflows for lease payments approximate the $2 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2018. As of December 29, 2018, the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and lease guarantees of the residual values for these properties were $117 million and $100 million, respectively.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
