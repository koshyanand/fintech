Managements Discussion and Analysis  

Overview  

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the Company) delivered record financial performance in 2018. In a year where the economy expanded at a moderate rate and the labor market continued to strengthen, the Company had record net revenue, net income and diluted earnings per share, while continuing to invest in technology and innovation to drive growth and improve efficiencies in the future.  

The Company earned $7.1 billion in 2018, an increase of $878 million (14.1 percent) over 2017, principally due to total net revenue growth, lower noninterest expense and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (tax reform) enacted by Congress in late 2017. Net interest income increased as a result of the impact of rising interest rates on assets, earning assets growth, and higher yields on the reinvestment of securities, partially offset by higher rates on deposits and changes in funding mix. Noninterest income increased due to strong growth in payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees. The Companys continued focus on controlling expenses allowed it to achieve an industry-leading efficiency ratio of 55.1 percent in 2018. In addition, the Companys return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.55 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively, the highest among its peers.  

The Company remains deeply committed to value creation for shareholders, and during the third quarter of 2018, increased its dividend rate per common share by 23 percent. Overall, the Company returned 74 percent of its earnings to common shareholders through dividends and common share repurchases during 2018. This result was accomplished by the Company generating steady growth in commercial and consumer lending, by building momentum in its core business, particularly within Wealth Management and Investment Services and Payment Services, and by maintaining a strong capital base.  

The Companys common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio using the Basel III standardized approach and Basel III advanced approaches were 9.1 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Refer to Table 23 for a summary of the statutory capital ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Further, credit rating organizations rate the Companys debt among the highest of any bank in the world. This comparative financial strength provides the Company with favorable funding costs, strong liquidity and the ability to attract new customers. 

In 2018, average loans increased $4.2 billion (1.5 percent) over 2017, reflecting growth from new and existing customers. Loan growth included increases in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loans, due to customers paying down balances over the past year, as well as a decrease in loans covered by loss sharing agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (covered loans). During the fourth quarter of 2018, the majority of the Companys covered loans were sold and the loss share coverage expired. As of December 31, 2018, any remaining loan balances were reclassified to be included in their respective portfolio category.  

The Companys provision for credit losses decreased $11 million (0.8 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, reflecting stable credit quality in the Companys loan portfolios. The provision for credit losses was $25 million higher than net charge-offs in 2018, compared with $60 million higher than net charge-offs in 2017. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during 2018 reflected continued loan portfolio growth.  

The Companys strong 2018 financial results and momentum in its lending and fee businesses position it well for 2019. Loan growth accelerated in late 2018 even though the Company maintained its disciplined underwriting standards. The Company had strong 2018 sales activity in its fee businesses and continued to expand customer relationships across all of its businesses. Technology and innovation investment, such as digital, digital analytics and real-time payment capabilities remain a priority for the Company, however, the Company plans to remain vigilant in its expense discipline, driving long-term growth and creating value for shareholders. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated its 2015 Consent Order related to the Companys Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act program and controls in late 2018. Since 2014, the Company has made significant investments to risk management and compliance to enhance and strengthen this program. The exit from the consent order will give the Company more flexibility to optimize its existing branch network and to selectively expand into new markets with a digitally-led and branch-lite strategy.

Earnings Summary The Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $7.1 billion in 2018, or $4.14 per diluted common share, compared with $6.2 billion, or $3.51 per diluted common share, in 2017. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.55 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively, in 2018, compared with 1.39 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, in 2017. The results for 2018 included the impact of a gain from the sale of the Companys ATM servicing business and the sale of a majority of its FDIC covered loans, charges related to severance, certain asset impairments, an accrual for legal matters, and the favorable impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform. Combined, these items increased 2018 diluted earnings per common share by $0.03.  

Total net revenue for 2018 was $735 million (3.4 percent) higher than 2017, reflecting a 4.4 percent increase in net interest income (3.6 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis), and a 3.1 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the prior year was mainly a result of the impact of rising interest rates on assets, earning assets growth, and higher yields on the reinvestment of securities, partially offset by higher rates on deposits and changes in funding mix. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by strong growth in payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees, along with an increase in other noninterest income which reflected a gain on the sale of the Companys ATM servicing business offset by charges for asset impairments related to the sale of FDIC covered loans and certain other assets. These increases in noninterest income were partially offset by decreases in mortgage banking revenue and commercial products revenue.  

Noninterest expense in 2018 was $326 million (2.5 percent) lower than 2017, reflecting a decrease in marketing and business development expense due to lower charitable contributions to the Companys foundation and a decrease in other noninterest expense driven by lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects, lower FDIC insurance expense, and a reduction in mortgage servicing costs, as well as the impact of the settlement of a regulatory matter recorded in 2017. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased compensation expense supporting business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, and variable compensation related to revenue growth, higher employee benefits expense, and an increase in technology and communications expense in support of business growth. 

Statement of Income Analysis  

Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $13.0 billion in 2018, compared with $12.6 billion in 2017 and $11.9 billion in 2016. The $450 million (3.6 percent) increase in net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2018 compared with 2017, was principally driven by the impact of rising interest rates, earning assets growth, and higher yields on securities, partially offset by changes in loan mix, higher rates on deposits, and changes in funding mix, as well as the impact of tax reform which reduced the taxable-equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets. Average earning assets were $8.6 billion (2.1 percent) higher in 2018, compared with 2017, driven by increases in loans, other earning assets and investment securities. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2018 was 3.14 percent, compared with 3.10 percent in 2017 and 3.04 percent in 2016. The increase in the net interest margin in 2018, compared with 2017, was principally due to higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix, changes in loan mix, higher cash balances and the impact of tax reform. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section for further information on the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates.  

Average total loans were $280.7 billion in 2018, compared with $276.5 billion in 2017. The $4.2 billion (1.5 percent) increase was driven by growth in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate and covered loans. The $3.0 billion (3.1 percent) increase in average commercial loans was driven by higher demand for loans from new and existing customers. Average residential mortgages increased $3.1 billion (5.3 percent) reflecting origination activity. Average credit card balances increased $766 million (3.7 percent) due to customer account growth and higher revolving balances. The $720 million (1.3 percent) increase in average other retail loans was primarily due to higher auto, installment and retail leasing loans, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the Companys federally guaranteed student loan portfolio during 2018 and a decrease in home equity loans. Average commercial real estate loans decreased $2.1 billion (5.0 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, due to customers paying down balances over the past year. Average covered loans decreased $1.3 billion (37.1 percent), the result of the sale in late 2018 of the majority of these balances.

Average investment securities in 2018 were $2.1 billion (1.9 percent) higher than 2017, primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury, mortgage-backed and state and political securities, net of prepayments and maturities.  

Average total deposits for 2018 were essentially unchanged from 2017. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $3.7 billion (4.6 percent) lower in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to decreases in business deposits within Corporate and Commercial Banking and trust balances within Wealth Management and Investment Services. Average total savings deposits for 2018 were $1.2 billion (0.6 percent) lower than 2017, driven by decreases in Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances, partially offset by an increase in Consumer and Business Banking balances. The decline in Corporate and Commercial Banking total savings balances reflected run-off related to the business merger of a large financial services customer. Average time deposits for 2018 were $4.9 billion (14.5 percent) higher than 2017. The increase was primarily driven by increases in those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources such as wholesale borrowing, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, as well as consumer customers migration to certificates of deposits for higher yields.  

The $716 million (6.0 percent) increase in net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in 2017 compared with 2016, was principally driven by the impact of rising interest rates and loan growth. Average earning assets were $16.5 billion (4.2 percent) higher in 2017, compared with 2016, driven by 

 increases in loans, other earning assets and investment securities. The increase in the net interest margin in 2017, compared with 2016, was principally due to higher interest rates and changes in the loan portfolio mix, partially offset by rising funding costs and higher cash balances.  

Average total loans increased $8.7 billion (3.3 percent) in 2017, compared with 2016, driven by growth in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate and covered loans. Average commercial loans increased $3.9 billion (4.2 percent) in 2017, compared with 2016, driven by higher demand for loans from new and existing customers. The $3.1 billion (5.6 percent) increase in residential mortgages reflected origination activity. Average credit card balances increased $416 million (2.0 percent) due to customer growth. The $3.1 billion (5.9 percent) increase in average other retail loans was primarily due to higher auto, installment and retail leasing loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity loans and runoff of student loan balances. Average commercial real estate loans decreased $963 million (2.2 percent) in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily the result of disciplined underwriting of construction and development loans and customers paying down balances, while average covered loans decreased $776 million (18.4 percent), the result of portfolio run-off.  

Average investment securities in 2017 were $3.9 billion (3.6 percent) higher than 2016, primarily due to purchases of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities, in support of liquidity management.

    Net Interest Income  Changes Due to Rate and Volume(a)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

This table shows the components of the change in net interest income by volume and rate on a taxable-equivalent basis based on federal income tax rates of 21 percent for 2018 and 35 percent for 2017 and 2016. This table does not take into account the level of noninterest-bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate.  

Average total deposits for 2017 were $20.7 billion (6.6 percent) higher than 2016. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for 2017 were $757 million (0.9 percent) higher than 2016, reflecting increases in Wealth Management and Investment Services, and Consumer and Business Banking balances, offset by a decrease in Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. Average total savings deposits for 2017 were $19.2 billion (9.7 percent) higher than 2016, a result of growth across all business lines. Average time deposits, which are managed based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, increased $751 million (2.3 percent) in 2017, compared with 2016.  

Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses reflects changes in the size and credit quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses considered appropriate by management for probable and estimable incurred losses, based on factors discussed in the Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses section. 

In 2018, the provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, compared with $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $25 million, $60 million and $55 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during 2018 reflected loan portfolio growth and the continued maturity of vintages within the credit card portfolio, partially offset by improvements in the credit quality of the commercial loan and residential mortgage portfolios. Nonperforming assets decreased $211 million (17.6 percent) from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, primarily driven by improvements in residential mortgages, commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and other real estate owned (OREO), partially offset by increases in nonperforming other retail loans and other nonperforming assets. Net charge-offs increased $24 million (1.8 percent) in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher credit card loan net charge-offs, partially offset by lower commercial loan, commercial real estate loan and residential mortgage net charge-offs. 

26  

Table of Contents 

The increase in the allowance for credit losses during 2017 was driven by loan portfolio growth, the maturity of vintages within the credit card portfolio and exposures related to 2017 weather events, partially offset by improvements in the energy and residential mortgage portfolios. Nonperforming assets decreased $403 million (25.1 percent) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, primarily driven by improvements in commercial loans, residential mortgages and OREO balances, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming commercial real estate loans. Net charge-offs increased $61 million (4.8 percent) in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs, partially offset by lower net charge-offs related to residential mortgages and by commercial loan recoveries.  

Refer to Corporate Risk Profile for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.  

Noninterest Income Noninterest income in 2018 was $9.6 billion, compared with $9.3 billion in both 2017 and in 2016. The $285 million (3.1 percent) increase in 2018 over 2017 reflected strong growth in payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees, along with an increase in other 

 noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and commercial products revenue, which were impacted by industry trends in these categories. Payment services revenue was higher in 2018, compared with 2017, due to an 8.7 percent increase in credit and debit card revenue, a 12.0 percent increase in corporate payment products revenue and a 3.0 percent increase in merchant processing services revenue, all driven by higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees were 6.4 percent higher due primarily to business growth and favorable market conditions during most of 2018. Other noninterest income increased 17.6 percent primarily due to the net impact of a $340 million gain from the sale of the Companys ATM servicing business, partially offset by $264 million of charges for asset impairments related to the sale of a majority of the Companys covered loans and certain other assets, both recorded in 2018. In addition, the increase in other noninterest income reflected higher tax-advantaged project syndication revenue in 2018. Mortgage banking revenue decreased 13.7 percent in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to lower mortgage production and compression in gain on sale margins, while commercial products revenue decreased 6.2 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to lower corporate bond underwriting fees and trading revenue.

Table of Contents 

The $27 million (0.3 percent) increase in 2017 noninterest income over 2016 was primarily due to increases in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and treasury management fees, as well as higher gains on sales of investment securities, partially offset by decreases in mortgage banking revenue and other noninterest income. Payment services revenue was higher in 2017, compared with 2016, due to a 6.9 percent increase in credit and debit card revenue and a 6.3 percent increase in corporate payment products revenue, both driven by higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees were 6.7 percent higher due to favorable market conditions, and net asset and account growth, while treasury management fees increased 6.0 percent due to higher transaction volume. Mortgage banking revenue decreased 14.8 percent in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily due to lower origination and sales volumes from home refinancing activities which were higher in 2016, and lower margins on mortgage loan sales. Other revenue was 15.0 percent lower in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to lower equity investment income, which was higher in 2016 due to the sale of the Companys membership interest in Visa Europe Limited to Visa Inc. during that year.  

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in 2018 was $12.5 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in 2017 and $11.5 billion in 2016. The Companys efficiency ratio was 55.1 percent in 2018, compared with 58.5 percent in 2017 and 54.5 percent in 2016. The $326 million (2.5 percent) decrease in noninterest expense in 2018 from 2017 reflected decreases in marketing and business development expense and other noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in compensation, employee benefits and technology and communications expenses. Marketing and business development expense decreased 20.8 percent in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to a large contribution made by the Company to the U.S. Bank Foundation during 2017. Other noninterest expense 

 decreased 32.4 percent in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to the recognition of a $608 million accrual in 2017 for the settlement of a regulatory matter, as well as lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects, lower FDIC assessment costs driven by the elimination of an FDIC insurance surcharge in late 2018, and a reduction in mortgage servicing costs. Compensation expense increased 7.2 percent in 2018 over 2017, principally driven by the impact of hiring to support business growth technology initiatives and compliance programs, merit increases and higher variable compensation related to business production, partially offset by a special bonus awarded to eligible employees in 2017. Employee benefits expense increased 8.6 percent in 2018 primarily due to increased medical costs and staffing, while technology and communications expense increased 8.3 percent in support of business investment and core growth.  

The $1.3 billion (11.0 percent) increase in noninterest expense in 2017 over 2016 was primarily due to higher compensation expense, marketing and business development expense and other noninterest expense, partially offset by lower professional services expense. Compensation expense increased 10.2 percent in 2017 over 2016, principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, higher variable compensation related to business production and the 2017 special bonus awarded to eligible employees. Employee benefits expense was 12.5 percent higher primarily driven by increased medical costs. Marketing and business development expense was higher 24.6 percent, primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions to the U.S. Bank Foundation. In addition, other expense increased 25.5 percent in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily due to the impact of the accrual recorded in 2017 for the settlement of a regulatory matter and higher FDIC insurance expense. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in professional services expense of 16.5 percent, primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs neared maturity during 2017.

Pension Plans Because of the long-term nature of pension plans, the related accounting is complex and can be impacted by several factors, including investment funding policies, accounting methods and actuarial assumptions.  

The Companys pension accounting reflects the long-term nature of the benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets. Amounts recorded in the financial statements reflect actuarial assumptions about participant benefits and plan asset returns. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences in actual plan experience, compared with actuarial assumptions, are deferred and recognized in expense in future periods. Differences related to participant benefits are recognized in expense over the future service period of the employees. Differences related to the expected return on plan assets are included in expense over a period of approximately 15 years.  

Pension expense is expected to decrease by $43 million in 2019 primarily due to a higher discount rate. Because of the complexity of forecasting pension plan activities, the accounting methods utilized for pension plans, the Companys ability to respond to factors affecting the plans and the hypothetical nature of actuarial assumptions, the actual pension expense decrease may differ from the expected amount. The decrease in pension expense will result in a decrease in 2019 employee benefits expense of $16 million and a decrease in other noninterest expense of $27 million, compared with 2018.  

Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys pension plan funding practices, investment policies and asset allocation strategies, and accounting policies for pension plans.  

The following table shows an analysis of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and long-term rate of return (LTROR):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Income Tax Expense In late 2017, tax reform was enacted that, among other provisions, reduced the federal statutory rate for corporations from 35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017, resulting in an estimated net tax benefit of $910 million, which the Company recorded in 2017. The 2018 provision for income taxes was $1.6 billion (an effective rate of 17.9 percent) and reflected the reduced federal statutory rate and the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments related to tax reform estimates. The 2017 provision for income taxes was $1.3 billion (an effective rate of 16.8 percent) and reflected the impact of tax reform enacted during the period. The 2016 provision for income taxes was $2.2 billion (an effective rate of 26.7 percent). 

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Balance Sheet Analysis  

Average earning assets were $415.1 billion in 2018, compared with $406.4 billion in 2017. The increase in average earning assets of $8.6 billion (2.1 percent) was primarily due to increases in loans of $4.2 billion (1.5 percent), other earning assets of $2.7 billion (18.7 percent) and investment securities of $2.1 billion (1.9 percent).  

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on pages 142 and 143.  

Loans The Companys loan portfolio was $286.8 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $280.4 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.4 billion (2.3 percent). The increase was driven by increases in residential mortgages of $5.3 billion (8.8 percent), commercial loans of $4.9 billion (5.0 percent) and credit card loans of $1.2 billion (5.3 percent), partially offset by decreases in other commercial real estate loans of $924 million (2.3 percent), other retail loans of $894 million (1.6 percent) and the impact of the sale of the majority of the Companys covered loans. Table 6 provides a summary of the loan distribution by product type, while Table 12 provides a summary of the selected loan maturity distribution by loan category. Average total loans increased $4.2 billion (1.5 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was due to growth in most loan portfolio categories in 2018.  

Commercial Commercial loans, including lease financing, increased $4.9 billion (5.0 percent) at December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017. Average commercial loans increased $3.0 billion (3.1 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. The growth was primarily driven by higher demand from new and existing customers. Table 7 provides a summary of commercial loans by industry and geographical location.  

Commercial Real Estate The Companys portfolio of commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial mortgages and construction and development loans, decreased $924 million (2.3 percent) at December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017, primarily the result of customers paying down balances. Average commercial real estate loans decreased $2.1 billion (5.0 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Table 8 provides a summary of commercial real estate loans by property type and geographical location.  

The Company reclassifies construction loans to the commercial mortgage category if permanent financing criteria are met. In 2018, approximately $355 million of construction loans were reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $130 million and $161 million, respectively, of tax-exempt industrial development loans were secured by real estate. The Companys commercial mortgage and construction and development loans had unfunded commitments of $10.3 billion and $10.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company also finances the operations of real estate developers and other entities with operations related to real estate. These loans are not secured directly by real estate but have similar characteristics to commercial real estate loans. 

 These loans were included in the commercial loan category and totaled $9.8 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Residential Mortgages Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2018, increased $5.3 billion (8.8 percent) over December 31, 2017, as origination activity more than offset the effect of customers paying down balances during 2018. Average residential mortgages increased $3.1 billion (5.3 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Companys loan portfolio include well-secured jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality. 

Credit Card Total credit card loans increased $1.2 billion (5.3 percent) at December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017, reflecting new and existing customer growth during the year. Average credit card balances increased $766 million (3.7 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017.

Other Retail Total other retail loans, which include retail leasing, home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, decreased $894 million (1.6 percent) at December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017, reflecting the sale of the Companys federally guaranteed student loan portfolio during 2018, along with decreases in auto loans and home equity loans. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in installment and retail leasing loans. Average other retail loans increased $720 million (1.3 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher auto, installment and retail 

 leasing loans, partially offset by decreases in student loans and home equity loans. Of the total residential mortgages, credit card and other retail loans outstanding at December 31, 2018, approximately 72.8 percent were to customers located in the Companys primary banking region, essentially unchanged from December 31, 2017. Tables 9, 10 and 11 provide a geographic summary of residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans outstanding, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Companys intent may change over time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Companys intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale.  

Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were 

 $2.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $3.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in loans held for sale was principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan closings in late 2018, compared with the same period of 2017. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets; in particular in government agency transactions and to government sponsored enterprises (GSEs).

Investment Securities The Company uses its investment securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity (including the ability to meet regulatory requirements), generate interest and dividend income, and as collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding sources. While the Company intends to hold its investment securities indefinitely, it may sell available-for-sale securities in response to structural changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to meet liquidity requirements, among other factors.  

Investment securities totaled $112.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $112.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The $334 million (0.3 percent) decrease reflected a $686 million unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities, partially offset by $470 million of net investment securities purchases.  

Average investment securities were $113.9 billion in 2018, compared with $111.8 billion in 2017. The weighted-average yield of the available-for-sale portfolio was 2.57 percent at December 31, 2018, compared with 2.25 percent at December 31, 2017. The weighted-average maturity of the available-for-sale portfolio was 5.4 years at December 31, 2018, compared with 5.1 years at December 31, 2017. The weighted-average yield of the held-to-maturity portfolio was 2.46 percent at December 31, 2018, compared with 2.14 percent at December 31, 2017. The weighted-average maturity of the held-to-maturity portfolio was 5.2 years at December 31, 2018, compared with 4.7 years at December 31, 2017. Investment securities by type are shown in Table 13. 

The Companys available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) unless a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2018, the Companys net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities were $1.3 billion, compared with $580 million at December 31, 2017. The unfavorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of U.S. Treasury, mortgage-backed and state and political securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $888 million at December 31, 2017. The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment portfolio to determine whether any securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. When assessing unrealized losses for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company considers the nature of the investment, the financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of unrealized losses, expected cash flows of underlying assets and market conditions. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

The maturity of time deposits was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Deposits Total deposits were $345.5 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $347.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The $1.7 billion (0.5 percent) decrease in total deposits reflected decreases in total savings and noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in time deposits. Average total deposits in 2018 were essentially unchanged from 2017.  

Interest-bearing savings deposits decreased $7.2 billion (3.2 percent) at December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017. The decrease was related to lower money market and interest checking account balances, partially offset by higher savings account deposit balances. Money market deposit balances decreased $7.6 billion (7.0 percent), primarily due to lower Wealth Management and Investment Services, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances. The decline in Corporate and Commercial Banking balances reflected run-off related to the business merger of a large financial services customer. Interest checking balances decreased $526 million (0.7 percent) primarily due to lower Wealth Management and Investment Services balances, partially offset by higher Consumer and Business Banking and Corporate and Commercial Banking balances. Savings account balances increased $911 million (2.1 percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Average interest-bearing savings deposits in 2018 decreased $1.2 billion (0.6 percent), compared with 2017, reflecting lower Corporate and Commercial Banking and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances, partially offset by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. 

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2018, decreased $5.7 billion (6.6 percent) from December 31, 2017. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $3.7 billion (4.6 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. The decreases were primarily due to lower Corporate and Commercial Banking and Wealth Management and Investment Services balances.  

Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2018, increased $11.2 billion (33.6 percent), compared with December 31, 2017. Average time deposits increased $4.9 billion (14.5 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. The increases were primarily driven by increases in those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources such as wholesale borrowing, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, as well as consumer customers migration to certificates of deposits for higher yields.  

Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, were $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $16.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The $2.5 billion (15.1 percent) decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily due to a decrease in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and lower commercial paper balances, partially offset by higher repurchase agreement balances. 

37  

Table of Contents 

Long-term debt was $41.3 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $32.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The $9.1 billion (28.2 percent) increase was primarily due to issuances of $9.5 billion of bank notes and $2.1 billion of medium-term notes, partially offset by a $901 million decrease in FHLB advances and $1.5 billion of medium-term note maturities.  

Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and the Liquidity Risk Management section for discussion of liquidity management of the Company.  

Corporate Risk Profile  

Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Companys Board of Directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements.  

The Executive Risk Committee (ERC), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including strategic and reputational risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk.  

The Companys most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputational. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan, investment or derivative contract when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale securities, mortgage loans held for sale (MLHFS), mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation through failure to 

 comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Companys competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new customer relationships, offer new services or continue serving existing customer relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 144, for a detailed discussion of these factors.  

The Companys Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a three lines of defense model for establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officers organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Companys governance, risk management, and control processes.  

Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with management the Companys risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports by management assessing the Companys performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:  

    Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, and technology and cybersecurity;  

    Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;  

    Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (VaR); 

38  

Table of Contents 

    Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;  

    Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;  

    Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and  

    Strategic and reputational risk considerations, impacts and responses.  

Credit Risk Management The Companys strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Companys credit risk management process.  

In addition, credit quality ratings as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Companys rating scale for problem credits, as minimal risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans, those loans considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a modified or delinquent loan in a first lien position, encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows. The Company strives to identify potential problem loans early, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain appropriate allowance levels for probable incurred loan losses. Refer to Notes 1 and 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings.  

The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Companys two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending. Previously, the Company categorized covered loans, along with the FDICs related loss share coverage, in a separate covered loans segment. As of December 31, 2018, the majority of these loans were sold and the loss share coverage expired, with any 

 remaining balances reclassified to be included in the loan segment they would have otherwise been included in had the loss share coverage not been in place.  

The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the borrowers business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrowers debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged collateral, if any. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.  

The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases, home equity loans and lines, and student loans, a run-off portfolio. Home equity or second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10- or 15-year draw period during which a minimum payment is equivalent to the monthly interest, followed by a 20- or 10-year amortization period, respectively. At December 31, 2018, substantially all of the Companys home equity lines were in the draw period. Approximately $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, of the outstanding home equity line balances at December 31, 2018, will enter the amortization period within the next 36 months. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates and other economic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value (LTV) information reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. These risk characteristics, among others, are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment.  

The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 

39  

Table of Contents 

Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk, including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and interest rate contracts for customers, investments in securities and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing House transactions and the processing of credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes.  

Economic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product and consumer bankruptcy filings, as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from new tariffs or increases in existing tariffs.  

During 2018, domestic economic conditions continued to be favorable as evidenced by overall growth and a strong labor market with the lowest unemployment rate in decades. The domestic economy has experienced an increase in productivity growth over the past few years which has coincided with a rebound in business investment, including increases in capital spending in many sectors. Business investment is being supported by tax reform which lowers the cost of capital as well as by continued strong profitability of domestic companies. As a result, the Federal Reserve Bank continued to slowly increase short-term interest rates during 2018. However, global economic conditions that have exhibited strong growth over the past several years, reflecting higher consumer confidence, increased business investment and reduced political risks, have begun to moderate. In addition, uncertainty remains of the impact on the domestic economy resulting from tax reform, new tariffs, increases in existing tariffs, or future changes in interest rates or other domestic economic or trade policies. Current or anticipated changes to these policies that lessen their expansionary effect on the domestic economy could slow or further slow the expansion of the domestic and global economies.  

Credit Diversification The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers a broad array of traditional commercial lending products and specialized products such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending, small business lending, commercial real estate lending, health care lending and correspondent banking financing. The Company also offers an array of consumer lending products, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home 

 equity loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and loan production offices, mobile and on-line banking, and indirect distribution channels, such as auto dealers. The Company monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, customer and geography. Table 6 provides information with respect to the overall product diversification and changes in the mix during 2018.  

The commercial loan class is diversified among various industries with higher concentrations in manufacturing, finance and insurance, wholesale trade, retail trade, and real estate, rental and leasing. Additionally, the commercial loan class is diversified across the Companys geographical markets with 62.7 percent of total commercial loans within the Companys Consumer and Business Banking region. Credit relationships outside of the Companys Consumer and Business Banking region relate to the corporate banking, mortgage banking, auto dealer and leasing businesses, focusing on large national customers and specifically targeted industries, such as healthcare, utilities, energy and public administration. Loans to mortgage banking customers are primarily warehouse lines which are collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The Company regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position to manage its risk exposure. Table 7 provides a summary of significant industry groups and geographical locations of commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017.  

The commercial real estate loan class reflects the Companys focus on serving business owners within its geographic footprint as well as regional and national investment-based real estate owners and builders. Within the commercial real estate loan class, different property types have varying degrees of credit risk. Table 8 provides a summary of the significant property types and geographical locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018, approximately 24.7 percent of the commercial real estate loans represented business owner-occupied properties that tend to exhibit less credit risk than non owner-occupied properties. The investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified among various property types with somewhat higher concentrations in multi-family, office and retail properties. From a geographical perspective, the Companys commercial real estate loan class is generally well diversified. However, at December 31, 2018, 24.7 percent of the Companys commercial real estate loans were secured by collateral in California, which has historically experienced higher credit quality deterioration in recessionary periods due to excess inventory levels and declining valuations. Included in commercial real estate at year-end 2018 was approximately $416 million in loans related to land held for development and $471 million of loans related to residential and commercial acquisition and development properties. These loans are subject to quarterly monitoring for changes in local market conditions due to a higher credit risk profile. The commercial real estate loan class is diversified across the Companys geographical markets with 82.7 percent of total commercial real

 estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2018, within the Companys Consumer and Business Banking region.  

The Companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and on-line banking, indirect lending, correspondent banks and loan brokers. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.  

Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Companys branches, loan production offices, mobile and on-line services, and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages, credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.  

The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (CLTV) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have a LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans. 

The following tables provide summary information of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV and borrower type at December 31, 2018:

Home equity and second mortgages were $16.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $16.3 billion at December 31, 2017, and included $4.2 billion of home equity lines in a first lien position and $11.9 billion of home equity and second mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position. Loans and lines in a junior lien position at December 31, 2018, included approximately $4.9 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and approximately $7.0 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related first liens using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines, including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.  

The following table provides a summary of delinquency statistics and other credit quality indicators for the Companys junior lien positions at December 31, 2018:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See the Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses section for additional information on how the Company determines the allowance for credit losses for loans in a junior lien position.  

Credit card and other retail loans are diversified across customer segments and geographies. Diversification in the credit card portfolio is achieved with broad customer relationship distribution through the Companys and financial institution partners branches, retail and affinity partners, and digital channels.  

Tables 9, 10 and 11 provide a geographical summary of the residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan portfolios, respectively.  

Loan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Companys loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the billing statement. The Company measures delinquencies, both including and excluding nonperforming loans, to enable comparability with other companies. Delinquent loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded from delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a consumer lending customers account may be re-aged to remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have recently overcome temporary financial difficulties and have demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume regular payments. To qualify for re-aging, the account must have been open for at least nine months and cannot have been re-aged during the preceding 365 days. An account may not be re-aged more than two times in a five-year period. To qualify for re-aging, the customer must also have made three regular minimum monthly payments within

Delinquent loan ratios exclude $1.7 billion, $1.9 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.9 billion, and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, of loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Including these loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past due including all nonperforming loans was 3.21 percent, 4.16 percent, 5.73 percent, 7.15 percent, and 8.02 percent at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  

the last 90 days. In addition, the Company may re-age the consumer lending account of a customer who has experienced longer-term financial difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and conditions to the account. Such additional re-ages are limited to one in a five-year period and must meet the qualifications for re-aging described above. All re-aging strategies must be independently approved by the Companys risk management department. Commercial lending loans are generally not subject to re-aging policies.  

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $584 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $720 million at 

 December 31, 2017, and $764 million at December 31, 2016. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.20 percent at December 31, 2018, compared with 0.26 percent at December 31, 2017, and 0.28 percent at December 31, 2016.

Restructured Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.  

Troubled Debt Restructurings Concessionary modifications are classified as TDRs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received. TDRs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. At 

 December 31, 2018, performing TDRs were $3.9 billion, compared with $4.0 billion, $4.2 billion, $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Loans classified as TDRs are considered impaired loans for reporting and measurement purposes.  

The Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Companys TDRs are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Companys loan classes. Commercial lending segment TDRs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.  

The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in TDRs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions. These concessions may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time. The Company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as TDRs and continues to report them as TDRs after the trial period.  

Credit card and other retail loan TDRs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months.  

In accordance with regulatory guidance, the Company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be TDRs. If the loan amount exceeds the collateral value, the loan is charged down to collateral value and the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming.  

Acquired loans restructured after acquisition are not considered TDRs for purposes of the Companys accounting and disclosure if the loans evidenced credit deterioration as of the acquisition date and are accounted for in pools.

The following table provides a summary of TDRs by loan class, including the delinquency status for TDRs that continue to accrue interest and TDRs included in nonperforming assets:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months) and small business credit cards with a modified rate equal to 0 percent.  

 (b)  

Primarily represents loans less than six months from the modification date that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status (generally six months).  

 (c)  

Primarily represents loans with a modified rate equal to 0 percent.  

 (d)  

Includes $290 million of residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $37 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed.  

 (e)  

Includes $74 million of other retail loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $10 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed.  

 (f)  

Includes $192 million of Federal Housing Administration and United States Department of Veterans Affairs residential mortgage loans to borrowers that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy and $370 million in trial period arrangements or previously placed in trial period arrangements but not successfully completed.  

 (g)  

Approximately 6.1 percent and 45.8 percent of the total TDR loans purchased from GNMA mortgage pools are 30-89 days past due and 90 days or more past due, respectively, but are not classified as delinquent as their repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.  

Short-term Modifications The Company makes short-term modifications that it does not consider to be TDRs, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Consumer lending programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. Short-term modifications were not material at December 31, 2018.  

Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, restructured loans that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status, OREO and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded 

 as income. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible.  

At December 31, 2018, total nonperforming assets were $989 million, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The $211 million (17.9 percent) decrease in nonperforming assets, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, was driven by improvements in nonperforming residential mortgages, commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and OREO due to continued improving economic conditions, partially offset by increases in nonperforming other retail loans and other nonperforming assets. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.34 percent at December 31, 2018, compared with 0.43 percent at December 31, 2017, and 0.59 percent at December 31, 2016.  

OREO was $111 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $162 million at December 31, 2017 and $212 million at December 31, 2016, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were $1.4 billion in 2018, compared with $1.3 billion in both 2017 and 2016. The $24 million (1.8 percent) increase in total net charge-offs in 2018, compared with 2017, reflected higher credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs, partially offset by lower commercial, commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan net charge-offs. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.48 percent in 2018, compared with 0.48 percent in 2017 and 0.47 percent in 2016.  

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs for 2018 were $232 million (0.17 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $264 million (0.19 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2017 and $312 million (0.23 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2016. The decrease in net charge-offs in 2018, compared with 2017, reflected lower commercial and commercial real estate loan charge-offs, partially offset by lower commercial loan recoveries in 2018. The decrease in net charge-offs in 2017, compared with 2016, reflected higher commercial loan recoveries in 2017.  

Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2018 were $17 million (0.03 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $37 million (0.06 percent of average loans 

 outstanding) in 2017 and $60 million (0.11 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2016. Credit card loan net charge-offs in 2018 were $846 million (3.90 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $786 million (3.76 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2017 and $676 million (3.30 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2016. Other retail loan net charge-offs for 2018 were $259 million (0.46 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $243 million (0.44 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2017 and $221 million (0.42 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2016. The increase in total residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs in 2018, compared with 2017, reflected higher credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs due to portfolio growth and maturity of vintages within the credit card portfolio, partially offset by lower residential mortgage loan net charge-offs due to continuing improvement in economic conditions during 2018. The increase in total residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs in 2017, compared with 2016, also reflected higher credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs, partially offset by lower residential mortgage loan net charge-offs.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses reserves for probable and estimable losses incurred in the Companys loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for incurred losses on a quarterly basis. The evaluation of each element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors, including external factors such as regulatory guidance and economic conditions. Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.  

At December 31, 2018, the allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion (1.55 percent of period-end loans), compared with an allowance of $4.4 billion (1.58 percent of period-end loans) at December 31, 2017. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 544 percent at December 31, 2018, compared with 438 percent at December 31, 2017. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annual loan net charge-offs at December 31, 2018, was 328 percent, compared with 332 percent at December 31, 2017. Management determined the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2018.  

The allowance recorded for loans in the commercial lending segment is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and considers the migration analysis of commercial lending segment loans and actual loss experience. For each loan type, this historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, 

 underwriting standards, risk management practices or economic conditions. The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the selected loss experience is appropriate for each commercial loan type. The allowance recorded for impaired loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an individual loan analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans, rather than the migration analysis. The allowance recorded for all other commercial lending segment loans is determined on a homogenous pool basis and includes consideration of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, delinquency status, bankruptcy experience, portfolio growth and historical losses, adjusted for current trends. The allowance established for commercial lending segment loans was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, unchanged from December 31, 2017, reflecting overall portfolio growth, offset by improvement in credit quality.  

The allowance recorded for TDR loans and purchased impaired loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool, or the prior quarter effective rate, respectively. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The allowance recorded for all other consumer lending segment loans is determined on a homogenous pool basis and includes consideration of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experience, delinquency status, refreshed LTV ratios when possible, portfolio growth and historical losses, adjusted for current trends. Credit card and other retail loans 90 days or more past due are generally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the relatively short period of time to charge-off and, therefore, are excluded from nonperforming loans and measures that include nonperforming loans as part of the calculation.

 TABLE 19 

    Elements of the Allowance for Credit Losses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien. At December 31, 2018, the Company serviced the first lien on 41 percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position. The Company also considers information received from its primary regulator on the status of the first liens that are serviced by other large servicers in the industry and the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files. Regardless of whether or not the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $274 million or 1.7 percent of its total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2018, represented non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified.  

The Company uses historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position where the first lien is serviced by the Company, or can be identified in credit bureau data, to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the Company services that are current, but the first lien is delinquent or modified. Historically, the number of junior lien defaults has been a small percentage of the total portfolio (approximately 1 percent annually), while the long-term average loss rate on loans that default has been approximately 90 percent. In addition, the Company obtains updated credit scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter, and in some cases more frequently, and uses this information to qualitatively supplement its loss estimation methods. Credit score distributions for the portfolio are monitored monthly and any changes in the distribution are one of 

 the factors considered in assessing the Companys loss estimates. In its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses, the Company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment and with residential lines and loans that have a balloon payoff provision.  

The allowance established for consumer lending segment loans was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, unchanged from December 31, 2017, reflecting overall portfolio growth, along with the continued maturing of vintages within the credit card portfolio, offset by continued improvement in housing market conditions.  

In addition, the evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses on purchased non-impaired loans acquired after January 1, 2009, in the various loan segments considers credit discounts recorded as a part of the initial determination of the fair value of the loans. For these loans, no allowance for credit losses is recorded at the purchase date. Credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loans are a component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, the Company records a provision for credit losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining credit discounts.  

The evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for purchased impaired loans in the various loan segments considers the expected cash flows to be collected from the borrower. These loans are initially recorded at fair value and, therefore, no allowance for credit losses is recorded at the purchase date. 

50  

Table of Contents 

Subsequent to the purchase date, the expected cash flows of purchased loans are subject to evaluation. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized by recording an allowance for credit losses. If the expected cash flows on the purchased loans increase such that a previously recorded impairment allowance can be reversed, the Company records a reduction in the allowance. Increases in expected cash flows of purchased loans, when there are no reversals of previous impairment allowances, are recognized over the remaining life of the loans. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.  

The Companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses for both loan segments also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used. As a result, in addition to the amounts determined under the methodologies described above, management also considers the potential impact of other qualitative factors which include, but are not limited to, the following: economic factors; geographic and other concentration risks; delinquency and nonaccrual trends; current business conditions; changes in lending policy, underwriting standards and other relevant business practices; results of internal review; and the regulatory environment. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Companys allowance for credit losses for both loan segments. Table 19 shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class and underlying portfolio category.  

Although the Company determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the estimated amounts.  

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets through disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. Lease originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting standards referred to in the Credit Risk Management section, which includes an evaluation of the residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles.  

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately $6.6 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2018, compared with $5.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle type. As of December 31, 2018, vehicle lease residuals related to sport utility vehicles were 50.1 percent of the portfolio, while truck and auto classes represented approximately 21.7 percent and 15.4 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At year-end 2018, the individual vehicle model with the largest residual value outstanding represented 11.8 percent of the aggregate residual 

 value of all vehicles in the portfolio. This risk is generally mitigated by collateral, as well as residual value guarantees provided by the manufacturer in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2018, the weighted-average origination term of the portfolio was 40 months, unchanged from December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the commercial leasing portfolio had $495 million of residuals, compared with $510 million at December 31, 2017. At year-end 2018, lease residuals related to business and office equipment represented 32.8 percent of the total residual portfolio, while trucks and other transportation equipment represented 28.7 percent.  

Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems, or from external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the Companys objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities. The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data.  

Business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each business unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed, can support mission critical functions, including technology, networks and data centers supporting customer applications and business operations.  

While the Company believes it has designed effective processes to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute assurance that business disruption or operational losses would not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and business continuity and disaster recovery plans.  

In the past, the Company has experienced attack attempts on its computer systems, including various denial-of-service attacks on customer-facing websites. The Company has not experienced any material losses relating to these attempts, as a result of its controls, processes and systems to protect its networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. However, attack attempts on the Companys computer systems are increasing, and the Company continues to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect against these attempts.

Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation through failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and issues. In addition, the significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives over the past several years has increased the importance of the Companys compliance risk management activities. Refer to Supervision and Regulation in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, and the recent substantial changes to that regulation.  

Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings, market valuations and the safety and soundness of an entity. To manage the impact on net interest income and the market value of assets and liabilities, the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. The Company uses net interest income simulation analysis and market value of equity modeling for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk. The Company has established policy limits within which it manages the overall interest rate risk profile, and at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company was within those limits.  

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis One of the primary tools used to measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest 

 rate changes on net interest income is simulation analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates substantially all of the Companys assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the impact on net interest income of a 200 basis point (bps) upward or downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one-year period. The simulation also estimates the effect of immediate and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 bps as well as the effect of immediate and sustained flattening or steepening of the yield curve. This simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis, managements outlook and re-pricing strategies. These assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management strategies.  

The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies.  

Table 20 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding decisions. While the Company utilizes assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary significantly. For example, if deposit outflows are more limited (stable) than the assumptions the Company used in preparing Table 20, the projected impact to net interest income would increase to 1.58 percent in the Up 50 bps and 3.62 percent in the Up 200 bps scenarios.

Table of Contents 

Market Value of Equity Modeling The Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of the Companys assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates. The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain key assumptions about the nature of assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Management estimates the average life and rate characteristics of asset and liability accounts based upon historical analysis and managements expectation of rate behavior. Retail and wholesale loan prepayment assumptions are based on several key factors, including but not limited to, age, loan term, product type, seasonality and underlying contractual rates, as well as macroeconomic factors including unemployment rates, housing price indices, geography, interest rates and commercial real estate price indices. These factors are updated regularly based on historical experience and forward market expectations. The balance and pricing assumptions of deposits that have no stated maturity are based on historical performance, the competitive environment, customer behavior, and product mix. These assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation analysis is provided to the ALCO monthly and is used to guide asset/liability management strategies.  

Management measures the impact of changes in market interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of the yield curve. A 200 bps increase would have resulted in a 2.3 percent decrease in the market value of equity at December 31, 2018, compared with a 3.1 percent decrease at December 31, 2017. A 200 bps decrease would have resulted in a 7.3 percent decrease in the market value of equity at December 31, 2018, compared with an 8.0 percent decrease at December 31, 2017.  

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:  

    To convert fixed-rate debt from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;  

    To convert the cash flows associated with floating-rate debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments;  

    To mitigate changes in value of the Companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;  

    To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and  

    To mitigate the volatility of the Companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  

The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. In addition, the Company enters into interest 

 rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.  

The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities (TBAs), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. The estimated net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs and the related derivative instruments at December 31, 2018, to an immediate 25, 50 and 100 bps downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately $1 million, $8 million and $46 million, respectively. An immediate upward movement in interest rates at December 31, 2018, of 25, 50 and 100 bps would result in a decrease of approximately $2 million, $6 million and $26 million, in the fair value of the MSRs and related derivative instruments, respectively. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs.  

Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.3 billion of forward commitments to sell, hedging $1.2 billion of MLHFS and $1.5 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS.  

Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk.

Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which support customers strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, Covered Positions), employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Companys Market Risk Committee (MRC), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Companys Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Companys corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those inherent in the Companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related remeasurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the effectiveness of its risk programs by back-testing the performance of its VaR models, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and stress testing. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted.  

The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for the Companys Covered Positions were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during 2018 and 2017. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date.  

The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Companys Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008.  

The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the Companys Covered Positions were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These valuations are compared to third party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant variances are approved by senior management in the Companys corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third party prices, with significant variances approved by senior management in the Companys corporate functions.  

The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. The Company monitors the effectiveness of the models through back-testing, updating the data and regular validations. A three-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models.

Liquidity Risk Management The Companys liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Companys funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Companys profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong capital position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.  

The Companys Board of Directors approves the Companys liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Companys Board of Directors oversees the Companys liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Companys liquidity policy and limits, and regularly assesses the Companys ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.  

The Companys liquidity policy requires it to maintain diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, entity and market concentrations. The Company operates a Cayman Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term and medium-term notes. The Company also maintains a significant correspondent banking network and relationships. Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable certificates of deposit and commercial paper.  

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Companys access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Banks Discount Window. 

 Unencumbered liquid assets in the Companys available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment portfolios provide asset liquidity through the Companys ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of unencumbered available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities totaled $100.2 billion, compared with $100.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Refer to Table 13 and Balance Sheet Analysis for further information on investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Companys practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 2018, the Company could have borrowed an additional $98.8 billion from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank based on collateral available for additional borrowings.  

The Companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Companys reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were $345.5 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $347.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Refer to Table 14 and Balance Sheet Analysis for further information on the Companys deposits.  

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was $41.3 billion at December 31, 2018, and is an important funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the terms and maturities of the Companys long-term debt issuances and Balance Sheet Analysis for discussion on long-term debt trends. Short-term borrowings were $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018, and supplement the Companys other funding sources. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Balance Sheet Analysis for information on the terms and trends of the Companys short-term borrowings.  

The Companys ability to raise negotiated funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of the Companys credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Table 21 details the rating agencies most recent assessments.  

In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent companys liquidity. The parent companys routine funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital securities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The Company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt

 TABLE 21 

    Debt Ratings  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is currently well in excess of required liquidity minimums.  

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the parent company is classified as a well-known seasoned issuer, which allows it to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. Well-known seasoned issuers generally include those companies with outstanding common securities with a market value of at least $700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of non-convertible securities, other than common equity, in the last three years. However, the parent companys ability to issue debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by the Companys Board of Directors and/or the ALCO policy.  

At December 31, 2018, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $16.3 billion, compared with $15.8 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $2.1 billion of medium-term notes, partially offset by $1.5 billion of medium-term note maturities. As of December 31, 2018, there was $1.5 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in 2019. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash equivalents.  

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary bank are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the parent company from its banking subsidiary are limited by rules which compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined periods. 

 For further information, see Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement which requires banks to maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At December 31, 2018, the Company was compliant with this requirement.  

European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At December 31, 2018, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately $7.1 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England.  

In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries, transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the potential negative impact resulting from the United Kingdoms upcoming withdrawal from the European Union, is unlikely to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements include any contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has an obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or

market risk support. Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk support. The Company has not utilized private label asset securitizations as a source of funding.  

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Many of the Companys commitments to extend credit expire without being drawn and, therefore, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements or the Companys exposure to credit loss. Commitments to extend credit also include consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon notification to the consumer. Total contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2018 were $314.3 billion. The Company also issues and confirms various types of letters of credit, including standby and commercial. Total contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 2018 were $11.7 billion. For more information on the Companys commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, refer to Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Companys off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private investment funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt financing or support community-based investments in tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment returns, these arrangements in many cases assist the Company in complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. The entities in which the Company invests are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The Companys recorded net investment in these entities as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.0 billion. 

The Company also has non-controlling financial investments in private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The Companys recorded investment in these entities was approximately $27 million at December 31, 2018, and the Company had unfunded commitments to invest an additional $25 million. For more information on the Companys interests in unconsolidated VIEs, refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company to customers or other third parties requiring the Company to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a scheduled payment to be made under contract. The Companys primary guarantees include commitments from securities lending activities in which indemnifications are provided to customers; indemnification or buy-back provisions related to sales of loans and tax credit investments; and merchant charge-back guarantees through the Companys involvement in providing merchant processing services. For certain guarantees, the Company may have access to collateral to support the guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse provisions, be able to offset some or all of any payments made under these guarantees.  

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses arising from antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International. The indemnification by the Company and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no maximum amount. Refer to Note 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding guarantees, other commitments, and contingent liabilities, including maximum potential future payments and current carrying amounts.

Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company continually assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments.  

On September 18, 2018, the Company announced its Board of Directors had approved a 23 percent increase in the Companys dividend rate per common share, from $0.30 per quarter to $0.37 per quarter.  

The Company repurchased approximately 54 million shares of its common stock in 2018, compared with approximately 50 million shares in 2017. The average price paid for the shares repurchased in 2018 was $52.57 per share, compared with $52.89 per share in 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased by the Company under the current share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors was $1.4 billion. For a more complete analysis of activities impacting shareholders equity and capital management programs, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders equity was $51.0 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $49.0 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of corporate earnings and a preferred stock issuance, partially offset by common share repurchases, dividends and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other comprehensive income (loss).  

The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, which includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets: a general standardized approach and more risk-sensitive advanced approaches, with the Companys capital adequacy being evaluated against the methodology that is most restrictive. Currently, the standardized approach is most restrictive. Beginning January 1, 2018, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company reflect the full implementation of Basel III. Prior to 2018, the Companys capital ratios reflected certain transitional adjustments. Under Basel III, banking regulators 

 define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial services holding companies. These requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio and, for those banks calculating capital adequacy using advanced approaches, a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary leverage, ratio. The minimum required level for these ratios at December 31, 2018, was 6.375 percent, 7.875 percent, 9.875 percent, 4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding company level, to exceed the well-capitalized threshold for these ratios. At December 31, 2018, the minimum well-capitalized threshold for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio, and tier 1 total leverage exposure ratio was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 5.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The most recent notification from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency categorized the Companys bank subsidiary as well-capitalized under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions that are applicable to all banks. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the risk-based category of its covered subsidiary bank.  

As an approved mortgage seller and servicer, U.S. Bank National Association, through its mortgage banking division, is required to maintain various levels of shareholders equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. At December 31, 2018, U.S. Bank National Association met these requirements.  

Table 23 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017.  

The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Companys tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized approach, was 7.8 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2018, compared with 7.6 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2017.

Fourth Quarter Summary  

The Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, or $1.10 per diluted common share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $0.97 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.59 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 1.46 percent and 14.7 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The results for the fourth quarter of 2018 included the impact of the gain from the sale of the Companys ATM servicing business and the sale of a majority of its covered loans, charges related to severance, certain asset impairments, the accrual for legal matters, and the favorable impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform.  

Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018, was $231 million (4.1 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting a 4.0 percent increase in net interest income and a 5.4 percent increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest income from the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly a result of the impact of rising interest rates on assets, earning 

 assets growth, and higher yields on the reinvestment of securities, partially offset by higher rates on deposits and funding mix changes. The noninterest income increase was driven by strong growth in payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees, along with higher other noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in mortgage banking revenue and ATM processing services revenue.  

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $619 million (15.9 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting a decrease in marketing and business development expense due to lower charitable contributions to the Companys foundation and a decrease in other noninterest expense driven by lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects, lower FDIC insurance expense, and a reduction in mortgage servicing costs, as well as the impact of the settlement of a regulatory matter recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased compensation expense related to supporting business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, and variable compensation related to revenue growth, higher employee benefits expense, and higher technology and communications expense in support of business growth.

Table of Contents 

Fourth quarter 2018 net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $3.3 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The $103 million (3.2 percent) increase was principally driven by the impact of rising interest rates, earning assets growth, and higher yields on securities, partially offset by higher rates on deposits and changes in funding mix, as well as the impact of tax reform which reduced the taxable-equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets. Average earning assets were $7.0 billion (1.7 percent) higher in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting increases of $3.9 billion (1.4 percent) in average loans and $3.0 billion (18.0 percent) in average other earning assets. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 3.15 percent, compared with 3.11 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in deposit and funding mix, changes in loan mix, higher cash balances and the impact of tax reform.  

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $2.5 billion, representing an increase of $128 million (5.4 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase reflected strong growth in payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees, along with an increase in other noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and ATM processing services revenue. The increase in payment services revenue reflected higher credit and debit card revenue of $40 million (11.7 percent), corporate payment products revenue of $15 million (10.1 percent), and merchant processing services revenue of $15 million (4.0 percent), all driven by higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased $15 million (3.8 percent) principally due to business growth. Other noninterest income increased $105 million (51.2 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with the same period of the prior year, reflecting the net impact in the fourth quarter of 2018 of the $340 million gain from the sale of the Companys ATM servicing business and $264 million of charges for asset impairments related to the sale of a majority of the Companys covered loans and certain other assets, as well as higher equity investment income. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $31 million (15.3 percent) primarily due to lower mortgage production. Also, ATM processing services revenue decreased $26 million (32.5 percent) due to the sale of the Companys ATM servicing business.  

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.3 billion, compared with $3.9 billion in the same period of 2017, representing a decrease of $619 million (15.9 percent). The decrease was primarily due to lower marketing and business development expense and other noninterest expense, partially offset by higher personnel costs and technology and communications expense. Marketing and business development expense decreased $136 million (54.2 percent) primarily due to a large contribution made by the Company to the U.S. Bank Foundation in the prior year. Other noninterest expense decreased $611 million (54.3 percent) in the fourth quarter of 

 2018, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to the recording of the accrual in the fourth quarter of the prior year for the settlement of a regulatory matter, lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects, lower FDIC assessment costs and a reduction in mortgage servicing costs. These decreases were partially offset by severance charges and an accrual for a legal matter both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased $69 million (4.6 percent) over the same period of the prior year, principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, and higher variable compensation related to business production, partially offset by the special bonus awarded to certain eligible employees in the fourth quarter of 2017. Employee benefits expense increased $17 million (5.8 percent), primarily driven by increased medical costs, while technology and communications expense increased $18 million (7.6 percent) primarily due to technology investment initiatives in support of business growth.  

The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $368 million, an increase of $33 million (9.9 percent) from the same period of 2017. The provision for credit losses was $15 million higher than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $10 million higher than net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2018 reflected loan portfolio growth. Net charge-offs were $353 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The net charge-off ratio was 0.49 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 0.46 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

The provision for income taxes was $291 million (an effective rate of 13.5 percent) for the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments related to tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017. The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected the estimated $910 million net tax benefit of the Company initially revaluing its deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax reform, resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of 28.6 percent for the period.  

Line of Business Financial Review  

The Companys major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.  

Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the Companys business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. The allowance for credit losses and related provision expense are allocated to the lines of business based on the related loan balances managed. Goodwill and other intangible assets are

 assigned to the lines of business based on the mix of business of an entity acquired by the Company. Within the Company, capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to support evaluation of business performance. Business lines are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. Generally, the determination of the amount of capital allocated to each business line includes credit and operational capital allocations following a Basel III regulatory framework. Interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business line. Because funding and asset liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business line assets and liabilities, respectively, using a matched funding concept. Also, each business unit is allocated the taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. The residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management activities is included in Treasury and Corporate Support. Noninterest income and expenses directly managed by each business line, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segments financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the lines of business. Generally, operating losses are charged to the line of business when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business lines operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Certain activities that do not directly support the operations of the lines of business or for which the lines of business are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance are not charged to the lines of business. The income or expenses associated with these corporate activities is reported within the Treasury and Corporate Support line of business. Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.  

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Companys diverse customer base. During 2018, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, 2017 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.  

Corporate and Commercial Banking Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real 

 estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients. Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $1.6 billion of the Companys net income in 2018, or an increase of $154 million (10.6 percent), compared with 2017.  

Net revenue decreased $35 million (0.9 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $33 million (1.1 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to the impact of rising rates on the margin benefit from deposits, partially offset by lower rates on loans, reflecting a competitive marketplace, and lower deposit balances. The decrease in noninterest-bearing deposit balances reflected customers deploying balances to support business growth, while lower interest-bearing deposits reflected balance sheet run-off related to the business merger of a larger financial services customer. Noninterest income decreased $68 million (7.5 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to lower corporate bond underwriting fees and treasury management fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $26 million (1.7 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, reflecting higher net shared services expense driven by technology development and investment in infrastructure, partially offset by lower FDIC insurance expense and lower variable compensation expense related to capital markets activities. The provision for credit losses increased $79 million in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.  

Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking. Consumer and Business Banking contributed $2.2 billion of the Companys net income in 2018, or an increase of $465 million (26.2 percent), compared with 2017.  

Net revenue increased $248 million (3.0 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $332 million (5.7 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to the impact of rising rates on the margin benefit from deposits, along with growth in average loan and core deposit balances, partially offset by lower rates on loans. Noninterest income decreased $84 million (3.5 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, principally driven by lower mortgage banking revenue, in line with industry trends, primarily due to lower mortgage production, and a reduction in other noninterest income driven by lower end of term gains in retail leasing revenue due to lower vehicle sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher deposit service charges and ATM processing servicing revenue, reflecting higher transaction volumes.  

Noninterest expense increased $158 million (3.1 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher net shared services expense and higher personnel expense, reflecting the impact of investments supporting business growth and development as well as higher production related incentives. These increases were partially offset by lower mortgage banking costs. The provision for credit losses decreased $105 million

 (31.2 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, reflecting a favorable change in the reserve allocation as well as lower net charge-offs.  

Wealth Management and Investment Services Wealth Management and Investment Services provides private banking, financial advisory services, investment management, retail brokerage services, insurance, trust, custody and fund servicing through four businesses: Wealth Management, Global Corporate Trust & Custody, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management and Fund Services. Wealth Management and Investment Services contributed $806 million of the Companys net income in 2018, or an increase of $160 million (24.8 percent), compared with 2017.  

Net revenue increased $220 million (8.3 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $115 million (11.4 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to the impact of rising rates on the margin benefit from deposits. Noninterest income increased $105 million (6.4 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, principally due to favorable market conditions for the majority of 2018, business growth and net asset inflows.  

Noninterest expense increased $159 million (9.7 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to increased net shared service expense and higher personnel expense driven by investments to support business growth, higher production related incentives and increased staffing to support business development.  

Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services, consumer lines of credit and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $1.5 billion of the Companys net income in 2018, or an increase of $281 million (23.4 percent), compared with 2017.  

Net revenue increased $275 million (4.8 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $42 million (1.7 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher average loan volumes, partially offset by compression of loan rates in a rising rate environment. Noninterest income increased $233 million (6.9 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing services revenue, all driven by higher sales volumes.  

Noninterest expense increased $206 million (7.4 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, principally due to higher net shared services expense and personnel expense driven by implementation costs of capital investments, higher production related incentives and increased staffing to support business development. The provision for credit losses was essentially 

 unchanged in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, offset by a favorable change in the reserve allocation.  

Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Companys investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net income of $966 million in 2018, compared with $1.1 billion in 2017.  

Net revenue increased $27 million (1.9 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased $72 million (16.4 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to higher funding costs and changes in funding mix, partially offset by growth in the investment portfolio. Noninterest income increased $99 million (9.8 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, reflecting the impacts of 2018 gains on the sales of the Companys ATM servicing business and student loans, partially offset by certain 2018 asset impairments, including the FDIC covered loans sold during 2018, as well as a decrease in gains recognized on the sale of investment securities.  

Noninterest expense decreased $875 million (50.6 percent) in 2018, compared with 2017, principally due to the net impact of the accrual for the settlement of a regulatory matter, the charitable contribution made to the U.S. Bank Foundation and the special bonus awarded to eligible employees all recorded in 2017, partially offset by severance charges and the accrual for legal matters recorded in 2018. Noninterest expense further decreased in 2018, compared with 2017, due to a favorable change in net shared services expense allocated to manage the business and lower costs related to tax advantaged projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher personnel expense driven by increased staffing, higher variable compensation, and technology development related to business development efforts. The provision for credit losses was $17 million higher in 2018, compared with 2017, due to a higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a favorable change in the reserve allocation.  

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent starting in 2018 due to tax reform, compared with 36.4 percent in 2017. The residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included is in Treasury and Corporate Support. Income tax expense increased $1.1 billion in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to the net impact of tax reform on the Companys tax related assets and liabilities recorded in 2017 and 2018, partially offset by a lower corporate tax rate effective in 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:  

    Tangible common equity to tangible assets, and  

    Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets.  

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Companys capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in GAAP, or are not defined in banking regulations. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, certain capital measures related to prior periods are presented on the same basis as those capital 

 measures in the current period. The effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations for these periods were subject to certain transitional provisions. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Companys capital adequacy.  

The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.  

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Accounting Changes  

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses accounting standards recently issued but not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the Companys financial condition or results of operations, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of the Managements Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Companys financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding the Companys financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information (including third party sources or available prices), sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the Companys Audit Committee.  

Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are described below.  

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established to provide for probable and estimable losses incurred in the Companys credit portfolio. The methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are discussed in the Credit Risk Management section.  

Managements evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report. Although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect managements assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material 

 credit events, degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates. As discussed in the Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses section, management considers the effect of changes in economic conditions, risk management practices, and other factors that contribute to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses. If not considered, incurred losses in the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability of a banking institution.  

Given the many subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. The allowance for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures the incurred loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure, while nonperforming loans and net charge-offs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed. Therefore, the degree of change in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating aggregate allowance rates to reflect changes in economic uncertainty or business cycle conditions.  

Some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors require qualitative judgment. Management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of inherent losses, and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates, including economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment or bankruptcy rates, and concentration risks, such as risks associated with specific industries, collateral valuations, and loans to highly leveraged enterprises, in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses. The Companys determination of the allowance for commercial lending segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at December 31, 2018. If 10 percent of period ending loan balances (including unfunded commitments) within each risk category of this segment of the loan portfolio were to experience downgrades of two risk categories, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $252 million at December 31, 2018. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses appropriately considers the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates but actual losses may differ from those estimates. If inherent loss or estimated loss rates for commercial lending segment loans were to increase by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $179 million at December 31, 2018. The 

68  

Table of Contents 

 Companys determination of the allowance for consumer lending segment loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and estimated impairments on restructured loans. In the event that estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately $172 million at December 31, 2018. Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and inherent losses and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the Companys financial statements. Refer to the Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses section for further information.  

Fair Value Estimates A portion of the Companys assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These include all of the Companys available-for-sale investment securities, derivatives and other trading instruments, MSRs and MLHFS. The estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-fair value. The determination of fair value is important for certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other intangible assets, impaired loans, OREO and other repossessed assets.  

Fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently verified against observable market data where possible. Where observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on managements judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss).  

When available, trading and available-for-sale securities are valued based on quoted market prices. However, certain securities are traded less actively and, therefore, quoted market 

 prices may not be available. The determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash flows and prepayment, interest and default rates. For more information on investment securities, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the majority of the Companys derivative positions are valued using valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs. Certain derivatives, however, must be valued using techniques that include unobservable inputs. For these instruments, the significant assumptions must be estimated and, therefore, are subject to judgment. Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of the Companys derivative positions.  

Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair value.  

Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained, or may be purchased from others. The Company records MSRs at fair value. Because MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the assets future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, option adjusted spread, and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and independent third party valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings during the period in which they occur. Risks inherent in the valuation of MSRs include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company utilizes derivatives, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures, to mitigate the valuation risk. Refer to Notes 9 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs and an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments used to mitigate the valuation risk.  

Goodwill and Other Intangibles The Company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. In certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.  

The initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the 

69  

Table of Contents 

 acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the Company reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.  

In assessing the fair value of reporting units, the Company considers the stage of the current business cycle and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. Also, management often utilizes other information to validate the reasonableness of its valuations, including public market comparables, and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation multiples may be based on revenue, price-to-earnings and tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences, including size, operating leverage and other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined based on the amount of equity required for the reporting units activities, considering the specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The Company determines the amount of equity for each reporting unit on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements, capital markets activity in the Companys Corporate and Commercial Banking segment and includes deductions and limitations related to certain types of assets including MSRs and purchased credit card relationship intangibles. The Company does not assign corporate assets and liabilities to reporting units that do not relate to the operations of the reporting unit or are not considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. These assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Companys investment securities portfolio and other investments (including direct equity investments, bank-owned life insurance and tax-advantaged investments) and corporate debt and other funding liabilities. In the most recent goodwill impairment test, the portion of the Companys total equity allocated to the Treasury and Corporate Support operating segment included approximately $3 billion in excess of the economic and regulatory capital requirements of that segment.  

The Companys annual assessment of potential goodwill impairment was completed during the third quarter of 2018. Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill impairment was recognized. The Company continues to monitor goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment indicators throughout the year.  

Income Taxes The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and an insignificant amount to foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the 

 Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in managements judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of accrued taxes.  

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.  

Controls and Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change made in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  

The annual report of the Companys management on internal control over financial reporting is provided on page 71. The attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Companys independent accountants, regarding the Companys internal control over financial reporting is provided on page 73.

Report of Management  

Responsibility for the financial statements and other information presented throughout this Annual Report rests with the management of U.S. Bancorp. The Company believes the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and present the substance of transactions based on the circumstances and managements best estimates and judgment.  

In meeting its responsibilities for the reliability of the financial statements, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of publicly filed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  

To test compliance, the Company carries out an extensive audit program. This program includes a review for compliance with written policies and procedures and a comprehensive review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal control. Although control procedures are designed and tested, it must be recognized that there are limits inherent in all systems of internal control and, therefore, errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur. Also, estimates and judgments are required to assess and balance the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are independent of U.S. Bancorp. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants to consider audit results and to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters.  

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes the Company designed and maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.  

The Companys independent accountants, Ernst & Young LLP, have been engaged to render an independent professional opinion on the financial statements and issue an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Their opinion on the financial statements appearing on page 72 and their attestation on internal control over financial reporting appearing on page 73 are based on procedures conducted in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
