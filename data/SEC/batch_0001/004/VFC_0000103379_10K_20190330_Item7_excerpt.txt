ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the "Company”) is a global leader in the design, production, procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. VF’s diverse portfolio meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers — reshape our portfolio, transform our model, elevate direct-to-consumer and distort Asia.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, 

backpack, luggage, accessory and apparel categories. Our products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants, independently-operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners, and our own direct-to-consumer operations, which includes VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and brand e-commerce sites.

VF is organized by groupings of businesses represented by its reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. The four reportable segments are Outdoor, Active, Work and Jeans. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

VF changed to a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. VF previously used a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. All references to the years ended March 2019 ("2019"), December 2017 ("2017") and December 2016 ("2016") relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. All references to the three months ended March 2018 and March 2017 relate to the 13-week transition period ended March 31, 2018 and the comparable 13-week period ended April 1, 2017, respectively. All references to the twelve months ended March 2018 ("2018") relate to the 52-week period ended March 31, 2018. This period, when presented in comparison to our results for the year ended March 2019, is provided as we believe this comparison is more meaningful to our reader's understanding of our Fiscal 2019 results of operations than a comparison to the year ended December 2017. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the twelve months ended March 2018 and the three months ended March 2017 are presented at the end of the "Analysis of Results of Operations" section below for reference in the comparisons to the year ended March 2019 and the three months ended March 2018, respectively. The results for the twelve months ended March 2018 and the three months ended March 2017 are unaudited.

All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. All percentages shown in the tables below and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers. 

References to the year ended March 2019 foreign currency amounts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from the twelve months ended March 2018 and their impact on translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and on foreign currency-denominated transactions in countries with highly inflationary economies. References to the year ended December 2017 foreign currency amounts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from the year ended December 2016 and their impact on both translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and on transactions denominated in a foreign currency. References to the three months ended March 2018 foreign currency amounts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from the three months ended March 2017 and their impact on both translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and on transactions denominated in a foreign currency. VF’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in euro-based countries. Additionally, VF conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro, such as Argentina, which is a highly inflationary economy. 

In light of the recently completed portfolio management actions and organizational realignments, the Company realigned its 

22 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

internal reporting structure to reflect the organizational changes to better support and assess the operations of the business. The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on a global brand view with the new reportable segments: Outdoor, Active, Work and Jeans. In the tables below, the Company has recast historical financial information to reflect the new reportable segments. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated results of operations. Refer to additional discussion in the “Information by Reportable Segment” section below and Note 19 to VF's consolidated financial statements.

On October 2, 2017, VF acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. ("Williamson-Dickie") and the business results have been included in the Work segment. On April 3, 2018, VF acquired 100% of the stock of Icebreaker Holdings Limited ("Icebreaker"). On June 1, 2018, VF acquired 100% of the stock of Icon-Altra LLC, plus certain assets in Europe ("Altra"). The business results for Icebreaker and Altra have been included in the Outdoor segment. All references to contributions from acquisitions below represent the operating results of Williamson-Dickie through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition and the operating results of Icebreaker and Altra from their respective dates of acquisition. Refer to Note 3 to VF's consolidated financial statements for additional information on acquisitions.

On October 5, 2018, VF completed the sale of the Van Moer business, which was included in the Work segment. On October 26, 2018, VF completed the sale of the Reef® brand business, which was included in the Active segment. All references to dispositions 

below represent the impact of operating results of the Reef® brand and the Van Moer business, beginning in the period of disposition.

The Nautica® brand business, the Licensing Business (which comprised the Licensed Sports Group and JanSport® brand collegiate businesses), and the former Contemporary Brands segment have been reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and the related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, through their respective dates of disposal. Unless otherwise noted, amounts, percentages and discussion for all periods included below reflect the results of operations and financial condition from VF’s continuing operations. 

On August 13, 2018, VF announced its intention to spin-off its Jeans business, which includes the Wrangler®, Lee® and Rock & Republic® brands, as well as the VF Outlet™ business. The spin-off creates two independent, publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to VF and its shareholders and is effected through a pro-rata distribution of the new company’s stock to existing VF shareholders whereby each VF shareholder will receive one share of the new company's stock for every seven shares of VF stock held on the record date. The spin-off, which was completed after March 30, 2019 on May 22, 2019, is not reflected in our historical financial statements.

Refer to Note 4 to VF’s consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations and other divestitures.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Statements of Income

The following table presents a summary of the changes in net revenues for the year ended March 2019 compared to the twelve months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 compared to the year ended December 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Year Ended March 2019 Compared to Twelve Months Ended March 2018 (unaudited) 

VF reported a 12% increase in revenues in 2019. The 2019 results were driven by organic growth in the Active, Outdoor and Work segments, continued strength in our direct-to-consumer and international businesses and contributions from acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency, lower revenues due to dispositions and declines in the Jeans segment. International sales grew in every region in 2019. 

Year Ended December 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 2016 

VF reported a 7% increase in revenues in 2017. The 2017 results were driven by increases in the Active and Outdoor segments and continued strength in our direct-to-consumer and international businesses. The increase was also attributable to growth in the Work segment, which included a $247.2 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, which closed on October 2, 2017. These increases were offset by declines in the Jeans segment. International sales grew in every region in 2017.

Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Reportable Segment”.

The following table presents the percentage relationship to net revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Year Ended March 2019 Compared to Twelve Months Ended March 2018 (unaudited)

Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 50.7% in 2019 compared to 50.6% in 2018. Gross margin in 2019 was positively impacted by a mix-shift to higher margin businesses and increased pricing, partially offset by $45.9 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and separation of businesses, and costs related to the relocation of our global headquarters and certain brands to Denver, Colorado. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 40 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase is primarily due to $186.7 million of expenses related to the acquisition, integration and separation of businesses, and relocation of our global headquarters and certain brands to Denver, Colorado. The increase is also due to continued investments in our key strategic growth initiatives. These costs were partially offset by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues.

In 2019, operating margin decreased 30 basis points, to 12.1% from 12.4% in 2018, primarily due to the items described above.

Net interest expense decreased $1.4 million to $85.4 million in 2019. The decrease in net interest expense was due to higher 

international bank balances in high yielding currencies and the payoff of the $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017, which was partially offset by higher interest rates on increased levels of short-term borrowings.

Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $3.4 billion for both 2019 and 2018, with short-term borrowings representing 35.3% and 30.9% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt were 3.1% in 2019 and 2.9% in 2018.

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables, other components of net periodic pension cost (excluding the service cost component) and non-operating gains and losses. Other income (expense) netted to $(63.0) million and $(1.8) million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in other income (expense), net in 2019 is the loss on sale of the Reef® brand business of $14.4 million and loss on sale of $22.4 million related to the divestiture of the Van Moer business.

The effective income tax rate was 17.6% in 2019 compared to 46.6% in 2018. The effective income tax rate is substantially lower in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to discrete tax expense 

24 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

associated with the Tax Act. In December 2017, VF recognized a provisional charge of approximately $465.5 million to reflect the impacts resulting from the Tax Act, primarily comprised of approximately $512.4 million related to the transition tax and approximately $89.5 million of tax benefits related to revaluing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. Other provisional charges of $42.6 million were primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes as the Company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment on short-term liquid assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. All other foreign earnings, including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested.

The 2019 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of $18.9 million, which included $37.3 million net tax expense related to adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the Tax Act, $31.9 million of tax benefit related to stock compensation, $14.3 million of net tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest, $1.9 million of tax benefit related to adjustments of previously recorded amounts based on proposed regulations, and $1.2 million of tax expense related to adjustments to previously recognized state income tax credits. The $18.9 million net discrete tax expense in 2019 increased the effective income tax rate by 1.3% compared to an unfavorable 29.4% impact of discrete items for 2018. Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2019 decreased by approximately 0.9% primarily due to a lower US corporate income tax rate that was effective beginning January 1, 2018. The international effective tax rate was 11.6% for 2019.

As a result of the above, income from continuing operations in 2019 was $1.3 billion ($3.14 per diluted share), compared to $0.8 billion ($1.92 per diluted share) in 2018. 

Refer to additional discussion in the “Information by Reportable Segment” section below.

Year Ended December 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 2016

Gross margin improved 120 basis points to 50.5% in 2017 compared to 49.3% in 2016, reflecting a 180 basis point benefit from pricing, a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses and lower restructuring costs, which was partially offset by an unfavorable 60 basis point impact from foreign currency. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 230 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase is primarily due to investments in our key growth priorities, which include direct-to-consumer, product innovation, demand creation and technology initiatives. The increases were partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2017. 

In 2017, operating margin decreased 40 basis points, to 12.8% from 13.2% in 2016. In addition to the items described above, the operating margin decrease was partially offset by a 70 basis point increase from goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2016 that did not recur in 2017.

Net interest expense increased $0.3 million to $85.9 million in 2017. The increase in net interest expense was due to higher interest rates on short-term borrowings and higher interest on long-term debt balances due to a full year of interest on the €850 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes issued in September 2016, which were partially offset by the payoff of the $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017 and an increase in international short-term investment rates.

Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $3.2 billion for 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for 2016, with short-term borrowings representing 27% and 37% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt were 3.1% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2016, as the impact of the issuance of €850 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes in September of 2016 was offset by higher short-term debt rates.

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables, other components of net periodic pension cost (excluding the service cost component) and non-operating gains and losses. Other income (expense) netted to $(10.7) million and $(85.2) million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. A pension settlement charge of $50.9 million was included in 2016, which did not recur in 2017.

The effective income tax rate was 49.1% in 2017 compared to 16.0% in 2016. The effective income tax rate is substantially higher in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to discrete tax expense associated with the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduces the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21% is also required. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of $465.5 million, or $1.15 per share, during the three months ended December 2017. This amount, which is included in the income taxes line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, is primarily comprised of approximately $512.4 million related to the transition tax and approximately $89.5 million tax benefit related to revaluing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. Other provisional charges of $42.6 million were primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes as the Company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment on short-term liquid assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. All other foreign earnings, including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested.

The 2017 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of $438.9 million, which included the provisional net charge of $465.5 million related to the Tax Act, $25.2 million of tax benefits related to stock compensation, $2.9 million of net tax benefit related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest, and $1.9 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes, exclusive of the Tax Act. The $438.9 million net discrete tax expense in 2017 increased the effective income tax rate by 31.0% compared to a favorable 3.4% impact of discrete items in 2016. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2017 decreased by approximately 1.3% primarily due to the negative tax impact related to the 2016 goodwill impairment. The international effective tax rate was 13.1% and 10.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

As a result of the above, income from continuing operations in 2017 was $0.7 billion ($1.79 per diluted share), compared to $1.1 billion ($2.56 per diluted share) in 2016.

Transition Period Three Months Ended March 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 2017 (unaudited)

The following table presents a summary of the changes in net revenues from the comparable period in 2017: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

VF reported a 22% increase in revenues for the three months ended March 2018 compared to the 2017 period. The revenue increase was attributable to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, organic growth in the Active segment and continued strength in our direct-to-consumer and international businesses. These increases were partially offset by declines in the Jeans segment. Excluding the 

impacts from foreign currency, international sales grew in every region in the three months ended March 2018. 

Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Reportable Segment”.

The following table presents the percentage relationship to net revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross margin increased 20 basis points in the three months ended March 2018 compared to the 2017 period. Gross margin was favorably impacted by increases in pricing, a mix-shift to higher margin businesses in the Outdoor and Active segments, and foreign currency changes, offset by lower margins attributable to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition and certain increases in product costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 190 basis points during the three months ended March 2018 compared to the 2017 period. The increase was due to expenses related to the acquisition and integration of businesses and higher investments in our key growth priorities, which include demand creation, customer fulfillment, direct-to-consumer and product innovation. Higher compensation costs also impacted the three months ended March 2018.

Net interest expense increased $1.0 million during the three months ended March 2018 compared to the 2017 period. This increase was due to higher levels of short-term borrowings at higher interest rates compared to 2017, which was partially offset by lower interest on long-term debt due to the payoff of the $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017. Total outstanding debt averaged $3.2 billion in the three months ended March 2018 and $2.6 billion in the same period in 2017, with weighted average interest rates of 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively.

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 2018 was 11.2% compared to 20.8% in the three months ended 

March 2017. The three months ended March 2018 included a net discrete tax benefit of $16.1 million, which included a $12.1 million tax benefit related to stock compensation, a $7.3 million net tax benefit related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest, an $8.8 million tax expense related to the change of a prior estimate of taxes payable, and a $5.1 million net tax benefit related to adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the Tax Act. The $16.1 million net discrete tax benefit in the three months ended March 2018 reduced the effective income tax rate by 5.5% compared to a favorable 0.4% impact of discrete items in the three months ended March 2017. Without discrete items, the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 2018 decreased by 4.5% compared with the estimated annual effective tax rate applied to the three months ended March 2017 primarily due to a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the Tax Act.

As a result of the above, net income in the three months ended March 2018 was $261.2 million ($0.65 per share) compared to $213.3 million ($0.51 per share) in the 2017 period.

Information by Reportable Segment

As discussed above, VF realigned its internal reporting structure in Fiscal 2019 to reflect organizational changes to better support and assess the operations of the business. The new reportable segments are: Outdoor, Active, Work and Jeans. We have included an other category in the tables below for purposes of reconciliation of revenues and profit, but it is not considered a reportable segment. The Company has recast historical financial information to reflect the new reportable segments. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated results of operations.

The primary financial measures used by management to evaluate the financial results of VF's reportable segments are segment revenues and segment profit. Segment profit comprises the operating income and other income (expense), net line items of each segment.

Refer to Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of results of operations by segment, along with a reconciliation of segment profit to income before income taxes.

Outdoor

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Outdoor segment includes the following brands: The North Face®, Timberland® (excluding Timberland PRO®), Icebreaker®, Smartwool® and Altra®.

Year Ended March 2019 Compared to Twelve Months Ended March 2018 (unaudited)

Global revenues for Outdoor increased 9% in 2019, driven by growth in the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, including a 1% unfavorable impact due to foreign currency. Revenues in the Americas region increased 8% in 2019, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Europe region increased 9%, including a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region increased 12% in 2019, with a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Included in these results are revenues from the Icebreaker acquisition of $174.2 million and revenues from the Altra acquisition of $50.2 million. Excluding revenues from Icebreaker and Altra, Outdoor revenues increased 4% in 2019, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency.

Global revenues for The North Face® brand increased 9% in 2019, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The increase was due to strong operational growth across all channels and regions, including strong performance in the wholesale channel and growth in the direct-to-consumer channel driven by an expanding e-commerce business, comparable store growth and new store openings.

Global revenues for the Timberland® brand (excluding Timberland PRO®) decreased 1% in 2019, as slight increases in the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels were more than offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Increases in the direct-to-consumer channel were driven by growth in the Americas region and China, as well as e-commerce growth across all regions, partially offset by declines across the Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding China) regions.

Global direct-to-consumer revenues for Outdoor increased 7% in 2019, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding revenues from acquisitions, global direct-to-consumer revenues increased 3%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The increase was primarily due to a growing e-commerce business across all regions and new store openings. Global wholesale revenues for Outdoor increased 11%, driven by global growth in The North Face® brand and acquisitions, and included a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding revenues from acquisitions, wholesale revenues increased 4%, including a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The increase was driven by growth across all regions.

Operating margin decreased 20 basis points in 2019 driven by costs related to the relocation of certain brands to Denver, Colorado, partially offset by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues. 

Year Ended December 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 2016

Global revenues for Outdoor increased 2% in 2017, driven by growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency.

Revenues in the Europe region increased 15%, including a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1% in 2017 due to foreign currency.

Global revenues for The North Face® brand increased 4% in 2017, as growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, driven by comparable store and e-commerce growth, and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, were partially offset by relatively flat wholesale revenues. Global wholesale revenues for The North Face® brand were tempered by U.S. retailer bankruptcies, lower year-over-year off-price shipments and efforts to manage inventory levels in certain markets.

Global revenues for the Timberland® brand (excluding Timberland PRO®) increased 1% in 2017, as growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, driven by comparable store and e-commerce growth, and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency, were partially offset by declines in the wholesale channel.

Global direct-to-consumer revenues for Outdoor grew 9% in 2017, driven by an expanding e-commerce business, comparable store growth and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency. Global wholesale revenues for Outdoor decreased 2% in 2017, driven by the above-mentioned U.S. retailer bankruptcies, lower year-over-year off-price shipments and efforts to manage inventory levels in certain markets. 

Operating margin decreased 160 basis points in 2017, reflecting increased investments in direct-to-consumer, product and innovation, demand creation and technology, partially offset by gross margin expansion driven by a mix-shift to higher margin businesses, lower product costs and pricing.

Global revenues for the Timberland® brand (excluding Timberland PRO®) increased 5% in the three months ended March 2018 due 

to growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, driven by the Europe region, and a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency. The growth in the direct-to-consumer channel was due to comparable store and e-commerce growth, and was more than offset by declines in the wholesale channel. 

Global direct-to-consumer revenues for Outdoor grew 18% in the three months ended March 2018 compared to the 2017 period.

Revenues in the Americas region decreased 3% in 2019, driven primarily by declines in the wholesale channel and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The wholesale channel revenues were negatively impacted by a U.S. customer bankruptcy. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 1% in 2019 as increases in the wholesale channel were more than offset by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency.

Year Ended December 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 2016

Global Jeans revenues decreased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, as growth in the direct-to-consumer channel was more than offset by U.S. wholesale declines in the mass, mid-tier and department store channels. Specifically, our U.S. wholesale business has been impacted by a key customer's inventory destocking decision and continued channel consolidation, which was partially mitigated by strong growth with our digital wholesale partners. Revenues in the Americas region decreased 5% in 2017, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, driven by softness in the wholesale channel. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 3% in 2017 due to declines in the wholesale channel in Asia and India, partially offset by growth in the direct-to-consumer channel in Asia. European revenues increased 4% in 2017 due to growth in our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency.

Global revenues for the Wrangler® brand (excluding Wrangler® RIGGS) decreased 2% in 2017, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, driven by declines in the U.S. mass and western specialty businesses.

Reconciliation of Segment Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes

There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total segment profit to consolidated income before income taxes. These costs are (i) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which is excluded from segment profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses, (ii) interest expense, net, which is excluded from segment profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not 

under the control of segment management, and (iii) corporate and other expenses, discussed below, which are excluded from segment profit to the extent they are not allocated to the segments. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “Consolidated Statements of Income” section, and corporate and other expenses are discussed below.

Following is a summary of VF’s corporate and other expenses:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Information Systems and Shared Services

These costs include management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain, human resources, direct-to-consumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the segments based on utilization of those services. Costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the segments. Included in information systems and shared services costs in the year ended March 2019 and the year ended December 2017 are costs associated with software system implementations and upgrades and other strategic projects.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees, and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the segments. Included in corporate headquarters’ costs in the year ended March 2019 are certain expenses related to the acquisition, integration and separation of businesses, strategic project costs, cash and stock-based compensation expense and charitable contributions. The increase in corporate 

headquarters’ costs in the year ended December 2017 compared to the year ended December 2016 was primarily driven by higher strategic project costs, an increase in cash and stock-based compensation expense and charitable contributions.

Other

This category includes (i) costs of corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the segments, (ii) costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, and (iii) miscellaneous consolidated costs, the most significant of which is related to the expense of VF’s centrally-managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Included in other expense in the year ended March 2019 is the loss on sale of the Reef® brand business of $14.4 million and loss on sale of $22.4 million related to the divestiture of the Van Moer business. The decrease in other expense in the year ended December 2017 compared to the year ended December 2016 was largely driven by a $50.9 million settlement charge in 2016 related to our U.S. pension obligation, resulting from offering former employees a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their deferred vested benefits.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate and other expenses are those that have not been allocated to the segments for internal management reporting, including (i) information systems and shared service costs, (ii) corporate headquarters costs, and (iii) certain other income and expenses. The increases in corporate and other expenses in the three months ended March 2018 compared to the 2017 period resulted primarily from higher compensation costs and 

investments in our key strategic growth initiatives, including expenses related to the acquisition and integration of businesses. Certain corporate overhead costs previously allocated in 2017 to the former Sportswear segment, the former Outdoor and Action Sports segment and the former Imagewear segment for segment reporting purposes have been reallocated to continuing operations as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Balance Sheets

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at March 2019 compared to March 2018:

•Increase in accounts receivable — primarily due to the reclassification of certain allowances to accrued liabilities due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), higher wholesale shipments and the timing of cash collections.

•Increase in other current assets — primarily due to the reclassification of the right of return asset from inventories due to the adoption of ASC 606 and an increase in derivative assets.

•Increase in other assets — primarily due to an increase in net pension assets for certain defined benefit plans. 

•Decrease in short-term borrowings — due to net repayment of commercial paper borrowings.

•Increase in accounts payable — driven by the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors. 

•Increase in accrued liabilities — primarily due to the reclassification of certain allowances from accounts receivable due to the adoption of ASC 606 and higher accrued compensation, partially offset by a decrease in derivative liabilities.

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at March 2018 compared to December 2017:

•Increase in inventories — due to the seasonality of the business.

•Increase in other current assets — primarily due to higher levels of prepaid expenses.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Decrease in accounts payable — driven by the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors. 

•Decrease in accrued liabilities — primarily due to lower accrued compensation, accrued income taxes and the timing of payments for other accruals.

Liquidity and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in the current ratio at March 2019 compared to March 2018 was primarily due to a net decrease in current liabilities driven by lower short-term borrowings and a net increase in current assets driven by higher accounts receivable balances, as discussed in the "Balance Sheets" section above. The decrease in the current ratio at March 2018 compared to December 2017 was primarily driven by the increase in short-term borrowings.

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity. The decrease in the debt to total capital ratio at March 2019 compared to March 2018 was attributed to the increase in stockholders' equity which was driven by net income and stock-based compensation activity, partially offset by payments of dividends and purchases of treasury stock. The 

decrease in the debt to total capital ratio at March 2019 compared to March 2018 was also due to the decrease in short-term borrowings, as discussed in the "Balance Sheets" section above. The increase in the debt to total capital ratio at March 2018 compared to December 2017 was due to the increase in short-term borrowings, as discussed in the "Balance Sheets" section above. 

VF’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow from operating activities. Cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 41

In summary, our cash flows were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The cash flows related to discontinued operations and held-for-sale assets and liabilities have not been segregated, and remain included in the major classes of assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Accordingly, the information in the table above and cash flow discussion below include the results of continuing and discontinued operations.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income, adjustments to net income and changes in working capital. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended March 2019 compared to the twelve months ended March 2018 is primarily due to higher net income in the year ended March 2019, partially offset by an increase in net cash usage for working capital.

Cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat in the year ended December 2017 compared to the year ended December 2016 as lower net income was offset by working capital changes primarily related to an increase in accrued income tax payable resulting from the Tax Act. 

Cash Used by Investing Activities

The decrease in cash used by investing activities in the year ended March 2019 related primarily to $320.4 million of net cash paid for acquisitions in the year ended March 2019 compared with $740.5 million of net cash paid for acquisitions during the twelve months ended March 2018. Investing activities also included $430.3 million of proceeds received from the sale of businesses in the year ended March 2019, which is $215.3 million higher than the proceeds received from the sales of businesses during the twelve months ended March 2018. Capital expenditures increased $67.6 million compared to the twelve months ended March 2018.

VF’s investing activities in the year ended December 2017 related primarily to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition of $740.5 million, net of cash received. Additionally, the activities included $215.0 million of proceeds from the sale of LSG, which is $99.0 million higher than the proceeds received from the sale of the former Contemporary Brands segment in the year ended December 2016. Capital expenditures of $169.6 million and software purchases of $65.2 million offset the proceeds received. Capital expenditures decreased $6.3 million compared to the year ended December 2016. Software purchases increased $21.0 million in the year ended December 2017 primarily due to system implementations and investments in our digital platform.

Cash Used by Financing Activities

The increase in cash used by financing activities in the year ended March 2019 compared to the twelve months ended March 2018 was primarily due to a $2.1 billion net decrease in cash generated by short-term borrowings driven by lower net borrowings during the year ended March 2019 compared to the twelve months ended March 2018, partially offset by a $861.7 million decrease in treasury stock purchases and a $248.6 million decrease in payments on long-term debt.

The increase in cash used by financing activities in the year ended December 2017 compared to the year ended December 2016 was driven by (i) no long-term debt borrowings in 2017 compared to $951.8 million in proceeds during 2016, (ii) the $250.0 million repayment of long-term debt, and (iii) a $199.9 million increase in purchases of treasury stock. These increases were partially offset by the $1.1 billion increase in net cash generated by short-term borrowings.

During the years ended March 2019, December 2017 and December 2016, VF purchased 1.9 million, 22.2 million and 15.9 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorized by VF's Board of Directors. The cost was $150.7 million, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion with an average price per share of $80.62 , $54.04 and $62.80 in the years ended March 2019, December 2017 and December 2016, respectively.

As of the end of Fiscal 2019, the Company had $3.8 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase program. VF will continue to evaluate its use of capital, giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

VF relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. In December 2018, VF entered into a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) that expires in December 2023. The Global Credit Facility replaced VF's $2.25 billion revolving facility which was scheduled to expire in April 2020. VF may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed five years, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and acquisitions. Outstanding short-term balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 81.0 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 6.5 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.

VF has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $2.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. Commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of March 2019 were $650.0 

42 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

million and $15.3 million, respectively, leaving approximately $1.6 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at March 2019.

VF has $179.5 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $15.1 million, $25.1 million and $24.4 million at March 2019, March 2018 and December 2017, respectively. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 24.6%, 12.0% and 9.9% at March 2019, March 2018 and December 2017, respectively, excluding accepted letters of credit which are non-interest bearing to VF. The interest-bearing borrowings include short-term borrowings in Argentina.

VF repaid $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017, using a combination of operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings.

VF’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates. At the end of March 2019, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘A’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘A-1’ and ‘Prime-2’, respectively.

None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2021, 2023 and 2037 notes were rated 

below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Cash dividends totaled $1.94 per share in the year ended March 2019 as compared to $1.72 and $1.53 in the years ended December 2017 and 2016, respectively. The dividend payout ratio was 61.7% of diluted earnings per share in the year ended March 2019, as compared to 96.2% and 59.9% in the years ended December 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has declared a dividend of $0.51 per share that is payable in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020. The Company intends to reduce its quarterly dividend following the spin-off of the Jeans business in a manner that results in VF paying an annual dividend with a long-term targeted payout ratio of 50% to 55%.

On May 22, 2019, VF completed the spin-off of its Jeans business with the new company now operating as an independent, publicly traded company under the name Kontoor Brands, Inc. ("Kontoor Brands"). The spin-off is effected through a distribution to VF shareholders of one share of Kontoor Brands common stock for every seven shares of VF common stock held on the record date of May 10, 2019. In connection with the spin-off, Kontoor Brands transferred net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion to VF and its subsidiaries from its new debt issuance, which VF intends to use to pay off its short term borrowings. In addition, VF expects an increase of approximately $150 million in capital expenditures during Fiscal 2020 driven by infrastructure investments. 

Transition Period Three Months Ended March 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 2017 (unaudited)

In summary, our cash flows were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated, and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Accordingly, the information in the table above and cash flow discussion below include the results of continuing and discontinued operations.

Cash Used by Operating Activities

Cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income, adjustments to net income and changes in working capital. The increase in cash used by operating activities in the three months ended March 2018 is primarily due to an increase in net cash usage from working capital driven by the timing of payments and cash collections, partially offset by higher net income in the three months ended March 2018.

Cash Used by Investing Activities

The decrease in cash used by investing activities in the three months ended March 2018 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $20.8 million, which was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $13.5 million compared to the 2017 period.

Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities

The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 2018 was driven by a $533.8 million increase in net cash generated by short-term borrowings and a $188.0 million decline in treasury stock purchases. 

During the three months ended March 2018, VF purchased 3.4 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a total cost of $250.3 million (average price per share of $74.46) under the share repurchase program authorized by VF’s Board of Directors in 2017. During the three months ended March 2017, VF purchased 8.2 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a total cost of $438.3 million (average price per share of $53.32). As of the end of March 2018, the Company had $4.0 billion remaining for future repurchases under its current share repurchase program.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 43

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of March 2019 that will require the use of funds:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Long-term debt consists of required principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.

(2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for long-term liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation and other employee-related benefits, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. Amounts exclude liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits and deferred income taxes. Obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan are not included in the table above. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $17.7 million to our pension plans during Fiscal 2020. Future contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes to the plan, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

(3) Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt and the interest portion of payments on capital leases. Amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.

(4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments during the noncancelable lease term. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance, which are not included above.

(5) Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum advertising commitments. Actual payments could exceed minimum royalty obligations.

(6) Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at March 2019 related to inventory purchases.

(7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of Fiscal 2019 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:

•$116.2 million of surety bonds, custom bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the above table because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.

•Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments.

Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as its Global Credit Facility, additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

44 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

Risk Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers, or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:

Insured risks

VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability exposures. VF purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers to cover other risks, including directors and officers, property and umbrella, and to establish stop-loss limits on self-insurance arrangements.

Cash and equivalents risks

VF had $543.0 million of cash and equivalents at the end of Fiscal 2019. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.

Defined benefit pension plan risks

At the end of Fiscal 2019, VF’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of $67.8 million. The underfunded status includes a $118.4 million liability related to our unfunded U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan, $62.9 million of net liabilities related to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a $113.5 million asset related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan. VF has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans. VF will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years.

VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense, which has ranged in recent years from $34.8 million in the year ended December 2017 to $113.0 million in the year ended December 2016, including the $50.9 million settlement charge discussed below. These fluctuations are primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense. The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants.

In Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan, effective December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 2016, VF took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a one-time option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits, pursuant to which the plan paid $197.1 million in lump-sum distributions to settle $224.7 million of projected benefit obligations. The Company recorded $50.9 million in settlement charges during the year ended December 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). No additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were 

paid out of existing plan assets, and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged as a result of this offer. However, assuming other key assumptions remain unchanged, pension expense will decrease in future years due to lower amortization of net deferred actuarial losses. Refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.

VF has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. In 2005, VF’s U.S. defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. In more recent years, the investment strategy of the U.S. qualified plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance. Additionally, VF completed the one-time lump-sum offering noted above during the year ended December 2016 which reduced the number of plan participants in the U.S. qualified plan by 23%. Also, in Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan, effective December 31, 2018. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.

Interest rate risks

VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since all of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged approximately $1.2 billion during Fiscal 2019). However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during Fiscal 2019, the effect of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately $8.8 million.

Foreign currency exchange rate risks

VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 41% of VF’s revenues in the year ended March 2019 were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there is a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. As discussed later in this section, management hedges VF’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.

The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign businesses that are considered to be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances is deferred as a component of accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity. The U.S. dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. On September 20, 2016, VF issued €850 

VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 45

million of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes which it has designated as a net investment hedge of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales, operating costs and intercompany royalty payments). VF’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future. This use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.

For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of Fiscal 2019, if there were a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of Fiscal 2019, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $245 million. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.

Counterparty risks

VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.

Commodity price risks

VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.

Deferred compensation and related investment security risks

VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds. VF invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections. The increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date 

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known.

VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Inventories

VF’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. VF performs a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of 

individual styles or individual style-size-color stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of 

46 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

forecasting future demand, market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories.

Existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been material.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill

VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques - the replacement cost, market and income methods - and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective.

Fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible assets (collectively referred to herein as “trademarks”) represent individually acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Definite-lived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition. Definite-lived license intangible assets relate to VF's licensing contracts with customers. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and is assigned at the reporting unit level.

VF’s depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value, if any. VF’s amortization policies for definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license-related intangible assets, management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods.

Testing of Definite-Lived Assets

VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. VF tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, a fair value analysis must be performed, and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

When testing property, plant and equipment for potential impairment, VF uses the income-based discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or 

asset group. The estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the after-tax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value.

When testing definite-lived trademarks for potential impairment, management uses the income-based relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership), and the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the trademark (representing forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark) are compared to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of the trademark exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows of the trademark are less than its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the trademark is calculated in a manner consistent with indefinite-lived intangible assets discussed below, and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the trademark and its carrying value.

When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method, to value customer relationship assets. Under this method, VF calculates the present value of the after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges.

Rock & Republic® Impairment Analysis

The Rock & Republic® brand has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with Kohl's Corporation that covers all branded apparel, accessories and other merchandise. As of June 30, 2018, VF performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the Rock & Republic® amortizing trademark intangible asset to determine if the carrying value was recoverable. We determined this testing was necessary based on the expectation that certain customer contract terms would be modified. Management used the income-based relief-from-royalty method and the contractual 4% royalty rate to calculate the pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows. Based on the analysis performed, management concluded that the trademark intangible asset did not require further testing 

VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 47

as the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of $49.0 million.

It is possible that VF's conclusion regarding the recoverability of the intangible asset could change in future periods as there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis as of June 30, 2018 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. 

Testing of Indefinite-Lived Assets and Goodwill

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. As part of its annual impairment testing, VF may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark is based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership), and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s WACC that considers market participant assumptions, plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of (i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if applicable, (ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry, and (iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.

Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by segment management.

For goodwill impairment testing, VF estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC as discussed above. For the market-based approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual 

transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit.

Based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and market-based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, VF calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value.

The income-based fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:

•Annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10-year forecast period.

•A terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.

•A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.

Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of VF’s reporting units.

Timberland Reporting Unit Impairment Analysis

The historical Timberland reporting unit included the Timberland PRO® brand and was included in the former Outdoor & Action Sports segment. In connection with the segment reporting changes in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, Timberland PRO was identified as a new reporting unit. Accordingly, VF was required to evaluate whether there was any impairment at the historical Timberland reporting unit, and allocate to Timberland PRO a portion of the historical Timberland reporting unit goodwill of $844.6 million at the April 1, 2018 assessment date.

Management performed a quantitative impairment analysis and concluded that the estimated fair value of the historical Timberland reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by a substantial amount, and thus the goodwill was not impaired.

48 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

Management allocated $51.5 million of the historical Timberland reporting unit goodwill balance to Timberland PRO, based on estimated relative fair values. The goodwill for the Timberland PRO reporting unit is included in the Work reportable segment. The remaining goodwill from the historical Timberland reporting unit is included in the Outdoor reportable segment.

Management considered whether there were any triggering events that would require impairment testing for the new reporting units and determined that there were none.

Jeanswear North America Reporting Unit Impairment Analysis

The historical Jeanswear North America reporting unit included the Wrangler® RIGGS brand and was included in the former Jeanswear segment. In connection with the segment reporting changes in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, Wrangler RIGGS was identified as a new reporting unit. Accordingly, VF was required to evaluate whether there was any impairment at the historical Jeanswear North America reporting unit, and allocate to Wrangler RIGGS a portion of the historical Jeanswear North America reporting unit goodwill of $142.1 million at the April 1, 2018 assessment date.

Management performed a quantitative impairment analysis and concluded that the estimated fair value of the historical Jeanswear North America reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by a substantial amount, and thus the goodwill was not impaired.

Management allocated $7.4 million of the historical Jeanswear North America reporting unit goodwill balance to Wrangler RIGGS, based on estimated relative fair values. The goodwill for the Wrangler RIGGS reporting unit is included in the Work reportable segment. The remaining goodwill from the historical Jeanswear North America reporting unit is included in the Jeans reportable segment.

Management considered whether there were any triggering events that would require impairment testing for the new reporting units and determined that there were none.

Reef® Impairment Analysis

In May 2018, management commenced a strategic assessment of the Reef® brand, which was considered a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the Reef® reporting unit. Based on the analyses, management concluded that the goodwill and trademark were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 16%. The estimated fair value of the trademark exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. 

The Reef® brand, acquired in 2005, sold surf-inspired products including sandals, shoes, swimwear, casual apparel and accessories for men, women and children. Products were sold globally through specialty stores, sporting goods chains, department stores, independent distributors and online. As part of the 2009 annual impairment analyses, VF recorded impairment charges of $31.1 million and $5.6 million related to the goodwill and trademark, respectively. The remaining carrying values of the goodwill and trademark at the May 26, 2018 testing date were $48.3 million and $74.4 million, respectively. Until its sale in October 2018, the Reef® brand was included in the Active reportable segment. 

Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Reef® reporting unit and intangible asset valuations considered historical Reef® performance, strategic initiatives for the Reef® reporting unit and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.

Key assumptions developed by VF management and used in the quantitative analyses of the Reef® reporting unit and trademark include:

•Modest growth in the wholesale channel driven by new product offerings and door expansion with existing and new customers;

•Modest growth in the e-commerce business;

•Gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses trending consistent with historical Reef® performance;

•Royalty rates based on active license agreements of the brand; and,

•Market-based discount rates.

Management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment, using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business. VF completed the sale of the Reef® brand business on October 26, 2018.

Fiscal 2019 Annual Impairment Testing

Management performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019. Management performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and trademark intangible assets, as discussed below in the “Qualitative impairment analysis” section.

Qualitative Impairment Analysis

For all reporting units, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired. In this qualitative assessment, VF considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, (ii) financial performance versus management’s annual and five-year strategic plans, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. If applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, VF concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.

Management’s Use of Estimates and Assumptions

Management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment, using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business. It is possible that VF’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the 

VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 49

businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in Fiscal 2020 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly 

traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.

A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on VF’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Stock Options

VF uses a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. VF believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders, and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. Management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of groups of option participants. The lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, VF estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected 

option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise, and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and death.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. Management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility is based on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. VF measures historical volatility over a ten-year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices. Management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten-year option term.

Pension Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan ("U.S. pension plans") that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations. In Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan, effective December 31, 2018. VF also sponsors certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid.

Annually, management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of the valuation date. VF also periodically reviews and revises, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. VF believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

The below discussion of discount rate, return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the U.S. pension plans, as they comprise approximately 91% of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 88% of VF’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined U.S. and international plans.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate, which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan. It is the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. The discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates. VF selects a discount rate for each of the U.S. pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan. VF uses the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. VF excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 1,046 such bonds. The bonds must be noncallable/nonputable unless make-whole provisions exist. Each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value. A single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics. VF believes that those ‘Aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the Fiscal 2019 discount rates of 3.98% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 3.99% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the long-term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the U.S. pension plans. These higher discount rates, compared with the rates of 3.66% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 3.70% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of December 2017, reflect the general increase in yields 

50 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K

of U.S. government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during Fiscal 2019. 

VF utilizes the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs. Under the spot rate approach, the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation, service cost, and interest cost for a more precise calculation. 

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return on investments. VF’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the long-term return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, regulatory and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of cash equivalents, U.S. and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed-income securities, insurance contracts, and alternative assets. VF develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors, including historical and expected returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed-income securities. The weighted average projected long-term rates of return of the various assets held by the U.S. qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long-term rate of return actuarial assumption. VF’s rate of return assumption was 5.70% in the year ended March 2019, 5.85% in the three months ended March 2018 and 6.00% in the years ended December 2017 and 2016. In recent years, VF has altered the investment mix by (i) increasing the allocation to fixed-income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments, and (ii) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments. The changes in asset allocation are anticipated, over time, to reduce the year-to-year variability of the U.S. qualified plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense. Management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year. Based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, VF will be using a rate of return assumption of 5.70% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for Fiscal 2020.

We consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans, and update these assumptions as appropriate. The Company performed a demographic assumptions study in 2017 and updated the assumptions, as necessary, in the year ended March 2019 valuations.

In 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued new mortality tables (RP-2014) and mortality improvement scales (MP-2014) which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables. In 2017, the SOA issued updated scales (MP-2017), which were adjusted for characteristics of our plan-specific populations and other data where appropriate, in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the U.S. pension plans. Management assessed the mortality assumption and concluded no change was needed for the year ended March 2019.

Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that year’s pension expense, but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the end of Fiscal 2019 for all pension plans, there were $399.1 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses, plus $0.6 million of pretax deferred prior service costs, resulting in an after-tax amount of $243.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the March 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet. These deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense.

Pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was $39.7 million in the year ended March 2019, $4.6 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $34.8 million and $113.0 million in the years ended December 2017 and 2016, respectively. Pension expense for the year ended December 2016 was higher as it included a $50.9 million settlement charge resulting from 9,400 participants accepting a one-time option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits (refer to Note 15). The cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees (commonly called “service cost”) was $22.4 million in the year ended March 2019, $5.9 million in the three months ended March 2018, $24.9 million in the year ended December 2017 and $25.8 million in the year ended December 2016. Pension expense was higher in the year ended March 2019 compared to the year ended December 2017 due to settlement and curtailment charges in the year ended March 2019 (discussed in Note 15) and higher interest costs resulting from higher interest rates for the U.S. pension plans, partially offset by lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses. Looking forward, VF expects pension income for the next 12 months of approximately $3.3 million as a result of lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and lower services costs.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on Fiscal 2019 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan at the end of Fiscal 2019, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As discussed in the “Risk Management” section above, VF has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. On a longer-term basis, VF believes the year-to-year variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease.

Income Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 U.S. and foreign jurisdictions each year. As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. VF makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which VF operates.

In February 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) opened a state aid investigation into Belgium’s rulings. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF. On March 22, 2016, the Belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the EU decision. Additionally, on June 21, 2016, VF Europe BVBA filed its own application for annulment of the EU decision. On December 22, 2016, Belgium adopted a law which entitled the Belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime. On January 10, 2017, VF Europe BVBA received an assessment for €31.9 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years. VF Europe BVBA remitted €31.9 million ($33.9 million) on January 13, 2017, which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment. An additional assessment of €3.1 million ($3.8 million) was received and paid in January 2018. On February 14, 2019 the General Court annulled the EU decision and on April 26, 2019 the EU appealed the General Court’s annulment. Both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved. If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF.

The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established, or to the extent VF is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.

VF has $249.4 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and $178.3 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of 

deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, VF records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of multi-national companies. Generally, accounting for the impacts of newly enacted tax legislation is required to be completed in the period of enactment; however, in response to the complexities and ambiguity surrounding the Tax Act, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to provide companies with relief around the initial accounting for the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, the SEC provided a one-year measurement period for companies to analyze and finalize accounting for the Tax Act. During the one-year measurement period, SAB 118 allowed companies to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates could be made for the impacts resulting from the Tax Act.

VF finalized its accounting for the Tax Act during the one-year measurement period under SAB 118, and recognized additional net charges of $18.2 million, primarily comprised of $14.3 million tax expense related to the transition tax, additional tax benefits of $0.3 million related to revaluing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, and $4.2 million tax expense related to establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, resulting in a cumulative net charge of $483.7 million. The measurement period adjustments include $5.1 million of net tax benefit recognized in the three months ended March 2018 and $23.3 million of net tax expense recognized during Fiscal 2019.

On January 15, 2019 final regulations under Section 965 related to the transition tax were released. After analyzing these regulations, the Company recorded an additional net charge of $13.9 million, primarily comprised of $20.7 million tax expense related to transition tax and a net tax benefit of $6.8 million related to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the final regulations.

The income tax payable attributable to the transition tax is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. At March 30, 2019, a noncurrent income tax payable of approximately $416.1 million attributable to the transition tax is reflected in "other liabilities" of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Tax Act created a new tax on certain global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) from foreign operations. Under GAAP, companies may make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes resulting from GILTI as a current-period expense when they are incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. The Company completed its analysis of the effects of the GILTI provisions and determined it will treat the taxes resulting from GILTI as a current-period expense, which is consistent with the treatment prior to the accounting policy election.
