Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. At December 31, 2018, we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $415.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 1.125% to 1.625%depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018, a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $4.2 million based on our current borrowing levels. 

Foreign Currency Risk

Our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of our revenue is denominated in British pounds and other foreign currencies. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against British pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars would decline. With regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in British pounds and other foreign currencies. If British pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in U.S. dollars will increase. Movements in the U.S. dollar to British pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. A hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.
