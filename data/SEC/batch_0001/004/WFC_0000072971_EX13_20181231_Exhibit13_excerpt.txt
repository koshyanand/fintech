Founded in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through 7,800 locations, more than 13,000 ATMs, digital (online, mobile and social), and contact centers (phone, email and correspondence), and we have offices in 37 countries and territories to support customers who conduct business in the global economy. With approximately 259,000 active, full-time equivalent team members, we serve one in three households in the United States and ranked No. 26 on Fortune’s 2018 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at December 31, 2018. 

We use our Vision, Values & Goals to guide us toward growth and success. Our vision is to satisfy our customers’ financial needs and help them succeed financially. We aspire to create deep and enduring relationships with our customers by providing them with an exceptional experience and by understanding their needs and delivering the most relevant products, services, advice, and guidance.

We have five primary values, which are based on our vision and guide the actions we take. First, we place customers at the center of everything we do. We want to exceed customer expectations and build relationships that last a lifetime. Second, we value and support our people as a competitive advantage and strive to attract, develop, motivate, and retain the best team members. Third, we strive for the highest ethical standards of integrity, transparency, and principled performance. Fourth, we value and promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of business and at all levels. Fifth, we look to each of our team members to be a leader in establishing, sharing, and communicating our vision for our customers, communities, team members, and shareholders. In addition to our five primary values, one of our key day-to-day priorities is to make risk management a competitive advantage by working hard to ensure that appropriate controls are in place to reduce risks to our customers, maintain and increase our competitive market position, and protect Wells Fargo’s long-term safety, soundness, and reputation.

1 Financial information for periods prior to 2018 has been revised to reflect presentation changes made in connection with our adoption in first quarter 2018 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report for more information.

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management

On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Board submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The consent order requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete third-party reviews of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until these third-party reviews are complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap will be measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. The Company continues to have constructive dialogue with the FRB on an ongoing basis to clarify expectations, receive feedback, and assess progress under the consent order. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback into the Company’s plans in a 

42Wells Fargo & Company 

thoughtful manner, adopt and implement the final plans as accepted by the FRB, and complete the required third-party reviews, the Company is planning to operate under the asset cap through the end of 2019. As of the end of fourth quarter 2018, our total consolidated assets, as calculated pursuant to the requirements of the consent order, were below our level of total assets as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, after removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions

On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company.

Retail Sales Practices Matters

As we have previously reported, in September 2016 we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains our top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, team members, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future.

Our priority of rebuilding trust has included numerous actions focused on identifying potential financial harm and customer remediation. The Board and management are conducting company-wide reviews of sales practices issues. These reviews are ongoing. In August 2017, a third-party consulting firm completed an expanded data-driven review of retail banking accounts opened from January 2009 to September 2016 to identify financial harm stemming from potentially unauthorized accounts. We have completed financial remediation for the customers identified through the expanded account analysis. Additionally, customer outreach under the $142 million class action lawsuit settlement concerning improper retail sales practices (Jabbari v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.), into which the Company entered to provide further remediation to customers, concluded in June 2018 and the period for customers to submit claims closed on July 7, 2018. The settlement administrator will pay claims following the 

calculation of compensatory damages and favorable resolution of pending appeals in the case.

For additional information regarding sales practices matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 16 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Additional Efforts to Rebuild Trust

Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to identify other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort, and we have accrued for the reasonably estimable remediation costs related to these matters, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As part of this effort, we are focused on the following key areas:

•Automobile Lending Business The Company is reviewing practices concerning the origination, servicing, and/or collection of consumer automobile loans, including matters related to certain insurance products, and is providing remediation to the extent it identifies affected customers. For example:

◦In July 2017, the Company announced it would remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf (based on an understanding that the borrowers did not have physical damage insurance coverage on their automobiles as required during the term of their automobile loans). The practice of placing CPI had been previously discontinued by the Company. The Company is in the process of providing remediation to affected customers and/or letters to affected customers through which they may claim or otherwise receive remediation compensation for policies placed between October 15, 2005, and September 30, 2016.

◦The Company has identified certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender, which will result in remediation to customers in certain states. The Company is in the process of providing remediation to affected customers.

•Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions In October 2017, the Company announced plans to reach out to all home lending customers who paid fees for mortgage rate lock extensions requested from September 16, 2013, through February 28, 2017, and to provide refunds, with interest, to customers who believe they should not have paid those fees. The plan to issue refunds follows an internal review that determined a rate lock extension policy implemented in September 2013 was, at times, not consistently applied, resulting in some borrowers being charged fees in cases where the Company was primarily responsible for the delays that made the extensions necessary. Effective March 1, 2017, the Company changed how it manages the mortgage rate lock extension process by establishing a centralized review team that reviews all rate lock extension requests for consistent application of the policy. Although the Company believes a substantial number of the rate lock extension fees during the period in question were appropriately charged under its policy, due to 

 Wells Fargo & Company43

Overview (continued)

our customer-oriented remediation approach, we have issued refunds and interest to substantially all of our customers who paid rate lock extension fees during the period in question. We have substantially completed the remediation process.

•Add-on Products The Company is reviewing practices related to certain consumer “add-on” products, including identity theft and debt protection products that were subject to an OCC consent order entered into in June 2015, as well as home and automobile warranty products, and memberships in discount programs. The products were sold to customers through a number of distribution channels and, in some cases, were acquired by the Company in connection with the purchase of loans. Sales of certain of these products have been discontinued over the past few years primarily due to decisions made by the Company in the normal course of business, and by mid-2017, the Company had ceased selling any of these products to consumers. We are in the process of providing remediation where we identify affected customers, and are also providing refunds to customers who purchased certain products. The review of the Company’s historical practices with respect to these products is ongoing, focusing on, among other topics, sales practices, adequacy of disclosures, customer servicing, and volume and type of customer complaints.

•Consumer Deposit Account Freezing/Closing The Company is reviewing procedures regarding the freezing (and, in many cases, closing) of consumer deposit accounts after the Company detected suspected fraudulent activity (by third-parties or account holders) that affected those accounts. This review is ongoing.

•Review of Certain Activities Within Wealth and Investment Management A review of certain activities within Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) being conducted by the Board, in response to inquiries from federal government agencies, is assessing whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments, or referrals of brokerage customers to the Company’s investment and fiduciary services business. The Board’s review is substantially completed and has not, to date, uncovered evidence of systemic or widespread issues in these businesses. Federal government agencies continue to review this matter. 

•Fiduciary and Custody Account Fee Calculations The Company is reviewing fee calculations within certain fiduciary and custody accounts in its investment and fiduciary services business, which is part of the wealth management business in WIM. The Company has determined that there have been instances of incorrect fees being applied to certain assets and accounts, resulting in both overcharges and undercharges to customers. These issues include the incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets. Systems, operations, and account-level reviews are underway to determine the extent of any assets and accounts affected, and root cause analyses are being performed with the assistance of third parties. These reviews are ongoing and, as a result of its reviews to date, the Company has suspended the charging of fees on some assets and accounts, has notified the affected customers, and is continuing its analysis of those assets and accounts. The review of 

customer accounts is ongoing to determine the extent of any additional necessary remediation, including with respect to additional accounts not yet reviewed, which may lead to additional accruals and fee suspensions.

•Foreign Exchange Business The Company has completed an assessment, with the assistance of a third party, of its policies, practices, and procedures in its foreign exchange (FX) business. The FX business continues to revise and implement new policies, practices, and procedures, including those related to pricing. The Company has begun providing remediation to customers that may have received pricing inconsistent with commitments made to those customers, and rebates to customers where historic pricing, while consistent with contracts entered into with those customers, does not conform to the Company’s recently implemented standards and pricing. The Company’s review of affected customers is ongoing.

•Mortgage Loan Modifications An internal review of the Company’s use of a mortgage loan modification underwriting tool identified a calculation error regarding foreclosure attorneys’ fees affecting certain accounts that were in the foreclosure process between April 13, 2010, and October 2, 2015, when the error was corrected. A subsequent expanded review identified related errors regarding the maximum allowable foreclosure attorneys’ fees permitted for certain accounts that were in the foreclosure process between March 15, 2010, and April 30, 2018, when new controls were implemented. Similar to the initial calculation error, these errors caused an overstatement of the attorneys’ fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan pursuant to the requirements of government-sponsored enterprises (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Customers were not actually charged the incorrect attorneys’ fees. As previously disclosed, the Company has identified customers who, as a result of these errors, were incorrectly denied a loan modification or were not offered a loan modification or repayment plan in cases where they otherwise would have qualified, as well as instances where a foreclosure was completed after the loan modification was denied or the customer was deemed ineligible to be offered a loan modification or repayment plan. The number of previously disclosed customers affected by these errors may change as a result of ongoing validation, but is not expected to have changed materially upon completion of this validation. The Company has contacted substantially all of the identified customers affected by these errors and has provided remediation as well as the option to pursue no-cost mediation with an independent mediator. The Company’s review of its mortgage loan modification practices is ongoing, and we are providing remediation to the extent we identify additional affected customers as a result of this review.

To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. This effort to identify other instances in which customers may have experienced harm is ongoing, and it is possible that we may identify other areas of potential concern.

Financial Performance

In 2018, we generated $22.4 billion of net income and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.28, compared with $22.2 billion of net income and EPS of $4.10 for 2017. We grew average commercial and industrial, and average real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans compared with 2017, maintained strong capital and liquidity levels, and rewarded our shareholders by increasing our dividend and continuing to repurchase shares of our common stock. Our achievements during 2018 continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model and our ability to generate consistent financial performance. We remain focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers. Noteworthy financial performance items for 2018 (compared with 2017) included: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•average loans of $945.2 billion, down 1%;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•return on assets (ROA) of 1.19% and return on equity (ROE) of 11.53%, up from 1.15% and 11.35%, respectively, a year ago;

•our credit results improved with a net charge-off rate of 0.29%, compared with 0.31% a year ago;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•$25.8 billion in capital returned to our shareholders through increased common stock dividends and additional net share repurchases, up 78% from a year ago.

Table 1 presents a six-year summary of selected financial data and Table 2 presents selected ratios and per common share data. 

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

Our balance sheet remained strong during 2018 with strong credit quality and solid levels of liquidity and capital. Our total assets were $1.90 trillion at December 31, 2018. Cash and other short-term investments decreased $42.5 billion from December 31, 2017, reflecting lower deposit balances. Debt securities grew $11.3 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2017. Our loan portfolio declined $3.7 billion from December 31, 2017. Growth in commercial and industrial loans and real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans was more than offset by declines in commercial real estate mortgage, real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage and automobile loans.

Deposits at December 31, 2018, were down $49.8 billion, or 4%, from 2017. The decline was driven by a decrease in commercial deposits from financial institutions, which includes actions the Company took in the first half of 2018 in response to the asset cap, and a decline in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost increased 21 basis points from a year ago driven by an increase in Wholesale Banking and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates.

Credit Quality

Credit quality remained solid in 2018, driven by continued strong performance in the commercial and consumer real estate portfolios. Performance in several of our commercial and consumer loan portfolios remained near historically low loss levels and reflected our long-term risk focus. Net charge-offs were $2.7 billion, or 0.29% of average loans, in 2018, compared with $2.9 billion, or 0.31%, in 2017. 

Net losses in our commercial portfolio were $429 million, or 9 basis points of average commercial loans, in 2018, compared with $446 million, or 9 basis points, in 2017, driven by decreased losses in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Net consumer losses decreased to 52 basis points of average consumer loans in 2018, compared with 55 basis points in 2017. Losses in our consumer real estate portfolios declined $93 million in 2018 to a net recovery position. The consumer loss levels reflected decreased losses in our automobile and other revolving and installment loan portfolios, lower losses in our residential real estate portfolios due to the benefit of the improving housing market, and our continued focus on originating high quality loans.

The allowance for credit losses of $10.7 billion at December 31, 2018, declined $1.3 billion from the prior year. Our provision for credit losses in 2018 was $1.7 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in 2017, reflecting a release of $1.0 billion in the allowance for credit losses, compared with a release of $400 million in 2017. The release in 2018 and 2017 was due to strong underlying credit performance.

Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at the end of 2018 were $6.9 billion, down 16% from the end of 2017. Nonaccrual loans declined $1.2 billion from the prior year end while foreclosed assets were down $191 million from 2017. 

Capital

Our financial performance in 2018 allowed us to maintain a solid capital position with total equity of $197.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $208.1 billion at December 31, 2017. We returned $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018 ($14.5 billion in 2017) through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, and our net payout ratio (which is the ratio of (i) common stock dividends and share repurchases less issuances and stock compensation-related items, divided by (ii) net income applicable to common stock) was 125%. During 2018 we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.39 to $0.43 per share. Our common shares outstanding declined by 310.4 million shares, or 6%, as we continued to reduce our common share count through the repurchase of 375.5 million common shares during the year. We expect our share count to continue to decline in 2019 as a result of anticipated net share repurchases.

We believe an important measure of our capital strength is the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis, which was 11.74% as of December 31, 2018, down from 11.98% a year ago, but still well above our internal target of 10%. Likewise, our other regulatory capital ratios remained strong. See the “Capital Management” section in this Report for more information regarding our capital, including the calculation of our regulatory capital amounts.

(1)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities, but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report.

Earnings Performance (continued)

Earnings Performance

Wells Fargo net income for 2018 was $22.4 billion ($4.28 diluted earnings per common share), compared with $22.2 billion ($4.10 diluted per share) for 2017 and $21.9 billion ($3.99 diluted per share) for 2016. Our financial performance in 2018 benefited from a $438 million increase in net interest income, a $784 million decrease in our provision for credit losses, and a $2.4 billion decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $2.4 billion decrease in noninterest income, and a $745 million increase in income tax expense.

Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, was $86.4 billion in 2018, compared with $88.4 billion in 2017 and $88.3 billion in 2016. The decrease in revenue for 2018 compared with 2017 was predominantly due to a decrease in noninterest income, reflecting decreases in mortgage banking income, insurance income, service charges on deposit accounts, and net gains (losses) from debt and equity securities, partially offset by an increase in all other noninterest income. Our diversified sources of revenue generated by our businesses continued to be balanced between net interest income and noninterest income. In 2018, net interest income of $50.0 billion represented 58% of revenue, compared with $49.6 billion (56%) in 2017 and $47.8 billion (54%) in 2016. Table 3 presents the components of revenue and noninterest expense as a percentage of revenue for year-over-year results.

See later in this section for discussions of net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense.

Earnings Performance (continued)

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest margin is the average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest income and the net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in Table 5 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% and 35% federal statutory tax rate for the periods ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, some variable sources of interest income, such as resolutions from purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can vary from period to period. 

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $50.7 billion in 2018, compared with $50.9 billion in 2017, and $49.0 billion in 2016. The decrease in net interest income in 2018, compared with 2017, was driven by:

•lower loan swap income due to unwinding the receive-fixed loan swap portfolio; 

•lower tax-equivalent net interest income from updated tax-equivalent factors reflecting new tax law; 

•a smaller balance sheet and unfavorable mix;

•higher premium amortization; and

•unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results;

partially offset by:

•the net repricing benefit of higher interest rates; and 

•higher variable income.

The increase in net interest income for 2017, compared with 2016, was driven by growth in earning assets and the benefit of higher interest rates, partially offset by growth and repricing of long-term debt. Deposit interest expense also increased in 2017, largely due to an increase in wholesale and Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) deposit pricing resulting from higher interest rates. 

Net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis

was 2.91% in 2018, compared with 2.87% in 2017 and 2.86% in 2016. The increase in net interest margin in 2018, compared with 2017, was driven by:

•the net repricing benefit of higher interest rates;

•runoff of lower yielding assets and other favorable mix; and

•higher variable income;

partially offset by:

•lower loan swap income due to unwinding the receive-fixed loan swap portfolio;

•lower tax-equivalent net interest income from updated tax-equivalent factors reflecting new tax law;

•higher premium amortization; and 

•unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results.

The slight increase in net interest margin in 2017, compared with 2016, was due to the repricing benefits of earning assets from higher interest rates exceeding the repricing costs of deposits and market based funding sources.

Table 4 presents the components of earning assets and funding sources as a percentage of earning assets to provide a more meaningful analysis of year-over-year changes that influenced net interest income.

Average earning assets decreased $38.1 billion in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease was driven by:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

partially offset by:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. Deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, market rate and other savings, savings certificates, other time deposits, and deposits in foreign offices. Average deposits decreased to $1.28 trillion in 2018, compared with $1.30 trillion in 2017, and represented 135% of average loans in 2018, compared with 136% in 2017. Average deposits were 73% of average earning assets in both 2018 and 2017.

Table 5 presents the individual components of net interest income and the net interest margin. The effect on interest income and costs of earning asset and funding mix changes described above, combined with rate changes during 2018, are analyzed in Table 6.

Table 6 allocates the changes in net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate. For 

this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based on the absolute value of the change due to average volume and average rate.

Noninterest income of $36.4 billion represented 42% of revenue for 2018, compared with $38.8 billion, or 44%, for 2017 and $40.5 billion, or 46%, for 2016. The decline in noninterest income in 2018 compared with 2017 was predominantly due to lower mortgage banking income, lower insurance income due to the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services in fourth quarter 2017, lower service charges on deposit accounts, lower gains on debt securities, and lower deferred compensation plan investment results (offset in employee benefits expense). These decreases were partially offset by higher gains from equity securities and higher all other income. The decline in noninterest income in 2017 compared with 2016 was predominantly driven by lower mortgage banking, impairments on low income housing credits and tax-advantaged renewable energy investments as a result of the Tax Act, and lower service charges on deposit accounts. These decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by growth in trust and investment fees, deferred compensation plan investment results (offset in employee benefits expense), and the net impact of our insurance services business divestiture in November 2017 and gains from the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans. For more information on our performance obligations and the nature of services performed for certain of our revenues discussed below, see Note 21 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Service charges on deposit accounts were $4.7 billion in 2018, down from $5.1 billion in 2017 due to lower overdraft and monthly service fees driven by customer-friendly initiatives that help customers minimize monthly service charges and overdraft fees, and the impact of a higher earnings credit rate applied to 

commercial accounts due to increased interest rates. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $261 million in 2017 from 2016 due to lower consumer and business checking account service charges, lower overdraft fees driven by customer-friendly initiatives including the Overdraft Rewind launched in November 2017, and a higher earnings credit rate applied to commercial accounts due to increased interest rates. 

Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees increased to $9.44 billion in 2018, from $9.36 billion in 2017, which increased $142 million from 2016. The increase in these fees in both 2018 and 2017 was due to higher asset-based fees, partially offset by lower transactional commission revenue. Retail brokerage client assets totaled $1.49 trillion at December 31, 2018, compared with $1.65 trillion and $1.49 trillion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. All retail brokerage services are provided by our WIM operating segment. For additional information on retail brokerage client assets, see the discussion and Tables 9d and 9e in the “Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment Management – Retail Brokerage Client Assets” section in this Report.

Trust and investment management fee income is largely from client assets under management (AUM), for which fees are based on a tiered scale relative to market value of the assets, and client assets under administration (AUA), for which fees are generally based on the extent of services to administer the assets.

Trust and investment management fees of $3.3 billion in 2018 declined slightly from 2017 as a decrease in corporate trust fees due to the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services in first quarter 2018 was only partially offset by growth in management fees for investment advice on mutual funds. Trust and investment management fees of $3.4 billion in 2017 were relatively stable compared with 2016. Our AUM totaled $638.3 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $690.3 billion and $652.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with substantially all of our AUM managed by our WIM operating segment. Additional information regarding our WIM operating segment AUM is provided in Table 9f and the related discussion in the “Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment Management – Trust and Investment Client Assets Under Management” section in this Report. Our AUA totaled $1.7 trillion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017, compared with $1.6 trillion at December 31, 2016. 

Investment banking fees of $1.8 billion in 2018 were relatively stable compared with 2017. Investment banking fees in 2017 increased $74 million compared with 2016 due to higher equity and debt originations, partially offset by lower advisory fees. 

Card fees were $3.9 billion in 2018, compared with $4.0 billion in 2017 and $3.9 billion in 2016. The decrease in 2018 reflected the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which reduced noninterest expense and lowered card fees in 2018 by an equal amount due to the netting of card payment network charges against related interchange and network revenues in card fees. This decrease in card fees in 2018 was partially offset by higher interchange fees. Card fees increased in 2017, compared with 2016, predominantly due to increased purchase activity.

Other fees were $3.4 billion in 2018, compared with $3.6 billion in 2017 and $3.7 billion in 2016. Other fees declined in both 2018 and 2017 predominantly due to lower all other fees. All other fees were $432 million in 2018, compared with $573 million in 2017 and $733 million in 2016. The decrease in 2018 compared with 2017 was driven by lost fees from discontinued products. The decrease in all other fees in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by lower fees from discontinued

products and the impact of the sale of our global fund services business in fourth quarter 2016. 

Mortgage banking income, consisting of net servicing income and net gains on loan origination/sales activities, totaled $3.0 billion in 2018, compared with $4.4 billion in 2017 and $6.1 billion in 2016. As further discussed below, the decrease in mortgage banking income in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily driven by overall reductions in the size of the residential mortgage market as well as declines in production margins. 

In addition to servicing fees, net servicing income includes amortization of commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), changes in the fair value of residential MSRs during the period, as well as changes in the value of derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge the residential MSRs during the period. Net servicing income of $1.4 billion for 2018 included a $112 million net MSR valuation loss ($960 million increase in the fair value of the MSRs and a $1.1 billion hedge loss). Net servicing income of $1.4 billion for 2017 included a $287 million net MSR valuation gain ($126 million decrease in the fair value of the MSRs and a $413 million hedge gain), and net servicing income of $1.8 billion for 2016 included a $826 million net MSR valuation gain ($565 million increase in the fair value of MSRs and a $261 million hedge gain). The decline in net MSR valuation results in 2018, compared with 2017, was predominantly due to negative MSR valuation adjustments in fourth quarter 2018 for servicing and foreclosure costs, discount rates and prepayment estimates recognized as a result of recent market observations related to an acceleration of prepayments, including for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans. The decrease in net MSR valuation gains in 2017, compared with 2016, was largely due to lower hedge gains in 2017 and MSR valuation adjustments in first quarter 2016 that reflected a reduction in forecasted prepayments due to updated economic, customer data attributes and mortgage market rate inputs. Net servicing income in 2018 was also favorably impacted by lower unreimbursed servicing and foreclosure costs as we continued to reduce our inventory of aged FHA loans in foreclosure.

Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.71 trillion at December 31, 2018, $1.70 trillion at December 31, 2017, and $1.68 trillion at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2018, the ratio of combined residential and commercial MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 0.94%, compared with 0.88% at December 31, 2017, and 0.85% at December 31, 2016. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for additional information regarding our MSRs risks and hedging approach.

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities was $1.6 billion in 2018, compared with $2.9 billion in 2017 and $4.3 billion in 2016. The decrease in both 2018 and 2017 was driven by decreased origination volumes and margins. 

 Mortgage loan originations were $177 billion in 2018, compared with $212 billion in 2017 and $249 billion in 2016. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations, which represents net gains on residential mortgage loan origination/sales activities divided by total residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations, provides a measure of the profitability of our residential mortgage origination activity. Table 7a presents the information used in determining the production margin.

Table 7a: Selected Mortgage Production Data 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Predominantly includes the results of Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loss mitigation activities, interest rate management activities and changes in estimate to the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses.

The production margin was 0.89% for 2018, compared with 1.34% for 2017 and 1.71% for 2016. The decline in the production margin in 2018 was due to lower margins in both retail and correspondent production channels and a shift to more correspondent origination volume, which has a lower production margin. The decrease in the production margin in 2017 was due to a shift in origination channel mix from retail to correspondent. 

 Mortgage applications were $230 billion in 2018, compared with $278 billion in 2017 and $347 billion in 2016. The 1-4 family first mortgage unclosed pipeline was $18 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $23 billion at December 31, 2017, and $30 billion at December 31, 2016. For additional information about our mortgage banking activities and results, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section and Note 10 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 18 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities include adjustments to the mortgage repurchase liability. Mortgage loans are repurchased from third parties based on standard representations and warranties, and early payment default clauses in mortgage sale contracts.

Insurance income was $429 million in 2018 compared with $1.0 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016. The decrease in both 2018 and 2017 was driven by the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services in fourth quarter 2017. The decrease in 2017 was also driven by the divestiture of our crop insurance business in first quarter 2016. 

Net gains from trading activities, which reflect unrealized changes in fair value of our trading positions and realized gains and losses, were $602 million in 2018, compared with $542 million in 2017 and $610 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 was due to growth in equity trading driven by market volatility, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income. The decrease in 2017, compared with 2016, was driven by lower customer accommodation trading activity. Net gains from trading activities do not include interest and dividend income and expense on trading securities. Those amounts are reported within interest income from trading assets and other interest expense from trading liabilities. For additional information about trading activities, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section and Note 4 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Net gains on debt and equity securities totaled $1.6 billion for 2018 and $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, after other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) write-downs of $380 million, $606 million and $642 million, respectively, for the same periods. The decrease in 2018 was predominantly driven by lower deferred compensation gains (offset in employee benefits expense) and lower net gains on debt securities, partially offset by higher net gains from nonmarketable equity securities and $313 million of unrealized gains from the impact of the new accounting standard for financial instruments which requires any gain or loss associated with the fair value measurement of equity securities to be reflected in earnings. The decrease in OTTI in 2018 was predominantly driven by lower write-downs in municipal debt securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities. The decrease in net gains on debt and equity securities in 2017, compared with 2016, was driven by lower net gains on debt securities, partially offset by higher net gains from nonmarketable equity securities. 

Lease income was $1.8 billion in 2018, compared with $1.9 billion in 2017, driven by lower rail and equipment lease income. Lease income in 2017 was stable compared with 2016. 

All other income was $1.8 billion in 2018, compared with $1.0 billion in 2017 and $702 million in 2016. All other income includes losses on low income housing tax credit investments, foreign currency adjustments, income from investments accounted for under the equity method, hedge accounting results related to hedges of foreign currency risk, and the results of certain economic hedges, any of which can cause decreases and net losses in other income. The increase in other income in 2018, compared with 2017, was predominantly driven by $2.0 billion higher pre-tax gains from the sales of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) Pick-a-Pay loans, a pre-tax gain from the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, and gains from the previously announced sale of 52 retail branches. The increase was partially offset by a gain from the sale of our insurance services business in 2017, a realized loss related to the previously announced sale of certain assets and liabilities of Reliable Financial Services, Inc. (a subsidiary of Wells Fargo’s automobile financing business), and a lower benefit from hedge ineffectiveness accounting. The increase in other income in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by a $848 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our insurance services business in fourth quarter 2017 and a $309 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a PCI Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio in second quarter 2017, as well as the impact of our adoption in fourth quarter 2017 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, partially offset by a gain from the sale of our crop insurance business in first quarter 2016 and a gain from the sale of our health benefit services business in second quarter 2016. All other income in 2017 also included $284 million of impairments on low income housing investments and $130 million of impairments on tax-advantaged renewable energy investments in each case due to the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (Tax Act).

Noninterest Expense

Table 8: Noninterest Expense 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The periods prior to 2018 have been revised to conform with the current period presentation whereby temporary help is included in contract services rather than in all other noninterest expense.

Noninterest expense was $56.1 billion in 2018, down 4% from $58.5 billion in 2017, which was up 12% from $52.4 billion in 2016. The decrease in 2018, compared with 2017, was driven by lower operating losses, personnel expenses, outside data processing, and FDIC expense, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion, equipment, and other expense. The increase in 2017, compared with 2016, was predominantly driven by higher operating losses, personnel expenses, and outside professional and contract services, partially offset by lower insurance and postage, stationery and supplies.

Personnel expenses, which include salaries, commissions, incentive compensation and employee benefits, were down $347 million, or 1% in 2018, compared with 2017, due to lower deferred compensation costs (offset in net gains from equity securities), and lower commission and incentive compensation, partially offset by salary and minimum pay increases, and higher company health plan and retirement plan expenses. Personnel expenses were up $1.5 billion, or 5% in 2017, compared with 2016, due to annual salary increases, higher deferred compensation costs (offset in net gains from equity securities), and higher employee benefits.

Equipment expense was up 9% in 2018, compared with 2017, due to increased computer purchases and equipment expense related to the Company’s migration to Windows 10, higher software license and maintenance expense, as well as higher depreciation expense. Equipment expense was up 4% in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily due to higher depreciation expense.

FDIC and other deposit assessments were down 14% in 2018, compared with 2017, due to the completion of the FDIC temporary surcharge which ended September 30, 2018. FDIC and other deposit assessments were up 10% in 2017, compared 

with 2016, due to an increase in deposit assessments as a result of the FDIC temporary surcharge which became effective on July 1, 2016. See the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information.

Operating losses were down $2.4 billion in 2018, compared with 2017, due to lower litigation accruals, partially offset by higher remediation accruals for previously disclosed matters. Operating losses were up $3.9 billion in 2017, compared with 2016, predominantly due to higher litigation accruals for a variety of matters, including mortgage-related regulatory investigations, sales practices, and other consumer-related matters. Litigation accruals in 2017 included $3.7 billion that were non tax-deductible.

Outside professional and contract services expense was up 1% in 2018, compared with 2017, driven by higher project and technology spending on regulatory and compliance related initiatives. Outside professional and contract services expense was up 18% in 2017, compared with 2016, driven by higher project and technology spending on regulatory and compliance related initiatives, as well as higher legal expense related to sales practice matters.

Outside data processing expense was down 26% in 2018, compared with 2017, reflecting lower data processing expense related to the GE Capital business acquisitions and the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which reduced noninterest expense and lowered card fees by an equal amount due to the netting of card payment network charges against related interchange and network revenues in card fees. Outside data processing expense was relatively stable in 2017, compared with 2016.

Advertising and promotion expense was up 40% in 2018, compared with 2017, due to higher advertising expense, including expense for the “Re-Established” advertising campaign launched in second quarter 2018. Advertising and promotion expense was up 3% in 2017, compared with 2016, due to higher advertising expense, including higher media and production expense, partially offset by lower sales promotion expense.

Foreclosed assets expense was down 25% in 2018, compared with 2017, predominantly due to lower operating expenses. Foreclosed assets expense was up 24% in 2017, compared with 2016, due to lower gains on sales of foreclosed properties, partially offset by lower operating expenses. 

Insurance expense was relatively stable in 2018, compared with 2017, and was down 44% in 2017, compared with 2016, predominantly driven by the sale of our crop insurance business in first quarter 2016.

All other noninterest expense was up 27% in 2018, compared with 2017, predominantly due to higher charitable donations expense, higher insurance premium payments, a pension plan settlement expense, and lower gains on the sale of corporate properties. All other noninterest expense was down 6% in 2017, compared with 2016, due to lower insurance premium payments and higher gains on the sale of a corporate property, partially offset by higher charitable donations expense. All other noninterest expense in 2018 included a $305 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation, compared with a $199 million contribution in 2017 and a $107 million contribution in 2016. 

Our full year 2018 efficiency ratio was 65.0%, compared with 66.2% in 2017 and 59.3% in 2016.

Income Tax Expense

The 2018 annual effective income tax rate was 20.2%, compared with 18.1% in 2017 and 31.5% in 2016. The 2018 effective income tax rate reflected the reduction to the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. It also included income tax expense related to non-deductible litigation accruals and the reconsideration of reserves for state income taxes following the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. In addition, we recognized $164 million of income tax expense associated with the final re-measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes and SEC Accounting Bulletin 118. The 2017 effective income tax rate included an estimated impact of the Tax Act including a benefit of $3.89 billion resulting from the re-measurement of the Company’s estimated net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, partially offset by $173 million of income tax expense for the estimated deemed repatriation of the Company’s previously undistributed foreign earnings. The 2017 effective income tax rate also included income tax expense of $1.3 billion related to the effect of discrete non tax-deductible items, predominantly consisting of litigation accruals. The effective income tax rate for 2016 included net reductions in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from settlements with tax authorities, partially offset by a net increase in tax benefits related to tax credit investments. See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our income taxes.

Operating Segment Results 

We are organized for management reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management (WIM). These segments are defined by product type and customer segment and their results are based on our management accounting process, for which there is no comprehensive, authoritative financial accounting guidance equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Effective first quarter 2018, we adopted a new funds transfer pricing methodology to allow for better comparability of performance across the Company. Under the new methodology, assets and liabilities now receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on a more granular level. This methodology change affects results across all three of our reportable operating segments and operating segment results for periods prior to 2018 have been revised to reflect this methodology change. Our previously reported consolidated financial results were not impacted by the methodology change; however, in connection with our adoption of ASU 2016-01 in first quarter 2018, certain reclassifications have occurred within noninterest income. Table 9 and the following discussion present our results by operating segment. For additional description of our operating segments, including additional financial information and the underlying management accounting process, see Note 26 (Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Community Banking reported net income of $10.4 billion in 2018, down $544 million, or 5%, from $10.9 billion in 2017, which was up $120 million, or 1%, from 2016. Revenue was $46.9 billion in 2018, down $105 million from $47.0 billion in 2017, which was up $505 million, or 1%, compared with 2016. The decrease in revenue in 2018 was due to lower mortgage banking revenue driven by lower mortgage loan originations and a decrease in servicing income, lower gains on debt securities, lower service charges on deposit accounts, and lower other fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher other income, including gains from the sales of PCI mortgage loans and the sale of 52 branches, and higher net interest income. The increase in revenue in 2017 was due to higher net interest income, higher gains on equity securities, higher deferred compensation plan investment results (offset in employee benefits expense), and higher other income (including higher net hedge ineffectiveness income and a gain on the sale of PCI mortgage loans), partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue, lower gains on debt securities, and lower service charges on deposit accounts.

 Average deposits increased $27.6 billion in 2018, or 4%, from 2017, which increased $26.0 billion, or 4%, from 2016. 

Noninterest expense of $30.5 billion decreased $2.1 billion in 2018, or 7%, from 2017, which increased $5.0 billion, or 18%, from 2016. The decrease in 2018 was predominantly driven by lower operating losses due to lower litigation accruals, partially offset by higher outside professional and contract services expense driven by project and technology spending on regulatory and compliance-related initiatives. The increase in 2017 was substantially due to higher operating losses driven by higher litigation accruals, higher personnel expense, and higher outside professional services, partially offset by lower foreclosed assets expense driven by improvement in the residential real estate portfolio, lower telephone and supplies expenses, and lower other expense. 

The provision for credit losses in 2018 decreased $772 million from 2017 due to credit improvement in the consumer real estate and automobile portfolios. The provision for credit losses in 2017 decreased $136 million from 2016 due to credit improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio.

Income tax expense was $3.8 billion in 2018, up $3.2 billion from $634 million in 2017, which was down $4.6 billion from 2016. Income tax expense in 2018 included the adverse impact of non-deductible litigation accruals, the reconsideration of reserves for state income taxes following the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., and the expense associated with the final re-measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. Income tax expense in 2017 included the estimated net benefit from the impact of the 2017 Tax Act to the Company, partially offset by the impact of discrete non tax-deductible items, predominantly litigation accruals.

Wholesale Banking reported net income of $11.0 billion in 2018, up $1.1 billion from 2017, which was down $28 million from 2016. The increase in 2018 was due to the reduced U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as well as lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower revenue. The decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income and lower loan loss provision. Revenue in 2018 of $28.7 billion decreased $1.3 billion, or 4%, from 2017, which decreased $1.0 billion, or 3%, from 2016. Net interest income of $18.7 billion in 2018 decreased $120 million, or 1%, from 2017, which increased $111 million, or 1%, from 2016. The decrease in net interest income in 2018 was due to lower income on trading assets, debt securities, and loans, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates and the increased income on leveraged leases related to the basis adjustment in 2017 associated with the Tax Act. The increase in net interest income in 2017 was due to strong deposit growth and the impact of rising interest rates, partially offset by lower income on debt securities and trading assets as well as the 2017 leveraged lease adjustment.

Average loans of $465.7 billion in 2018 were relatively flat compared with 2017, which increased $14.6 billion, or 3%, from 2016. Loan growth in 2018 from commercial and industrial loans was substantially offset by declines in commercial real estate loans. Loan growth in 2017 was broad based across many Wholesale Banking businesses and included the impact of the GE Capital business acquisitions in 2016. Average deposits of $423.7 billion in 2018 decreased $40.5 billion, or 9%, which increased $28 billion, or 6%, from 2016. The decline in 2018 was driven by actions taken in the first half of 2018 in response to the asset cap included in the FRB consent order on February 2, 2018, and declines across many businesses as commercial customers allocated more cash to higher-rate alternatives. 

Noninterest income of $10.0 billion in 2018 decreased $1.2 billion, or 10%, from 2017, which decreased $1.2 billion, or 9%, from 2016. The decrease in 2018 was driven by the impact of the 2017 sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA (WFIS), as well as lower trading, operating lease income, service charges on deposits and mortgage banking fees, partially offset by losses taken in fourth quarter 2017 from adjustments to tax advantaged businesses due to the Tax Act as well as the gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services in 2018. The decrease in 2017, compared with 2016, was driven by the gains on the sale of our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses in 2016, impairments to low income housing and renewable energy investments as a result of the Tax Act, lower insurance income driven by the 2016 sale of our crop insurance business, and lower gains on debt and equity securities. These declines were partially offset by a gain on the sale of our insurance services business in 2017.

Noninterest expense of $16.2 billion in 2018 decreased $467 million, or 3%, compared with 2017, which increased $723 million, or 5%, compared with 2016. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to lower personnel expense related to the sale of WFIS and lower variable compensation, lower project related spending, and lower FDIC expense, partially offset by higher operating losses and increased regulatory, risk, cyber and technology expenses. The increase in 2017 was predominantly due to increased project and technology spending on compliance and regulatory requirements. The provision for credit losses in 2018 decreased $39 million from 2017, from lower losses. The provision for credit losses in 2017 decreased from $1.1 billion in 2016, predominantly due to lower losses in the oil and gas portfolio.

WIM reported net income of $2.6 billion in 2018, down $190 million, or 7%, from 2017, which was up $133 million, or 5%, from 2016. Revenue of $16.4 billion in 2018 decreased $696 million from 2017, which was up $794 million from 2016. The decrease in revenue in 2018 was due to lower noninterest income and net interest income. The increase in revenue in 2017 was due to growth in net interest income and asset-based fees. Net interest income decreased 4% in 2018 primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Net interest income increased 9% in 2017 predominantly due to higher interest rates. Average loan balances of $74.6 billion in 2018 increased $2.7 billion from $71.9 billion in 2017, which was up 7% from 2016. Average deposits of $165.0 billion in 2018 decreased 13% from $189.0 billion in 2017, which was relatively flat compared with 2016. Noninterest income in 2018 decreased 4% from 2017 due to net losses from equity securities on lower deferred compensation plan investment results (offset in employee benefits expense), the impairment on the sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek, and lower transaction revenue, partially offset by higher asset-based fees.

Noninterest income in 2017 increased 3% from 2016 due to higher asset-based fees and gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in employee benefits expense), partially offset by lower transaction revenue. Noninterest expense of $12.9 billion in 2018 increased 2% from $12.6 billion in 2017 due to higher project and technology spending on compliance and regulatory requirements, higher broker commissions, higher operating losses and higher other personnel expense, partially offset by lower employee benefits from deferred compensation plan expense (offset in deferred compensation plan investments). Noninterest expense of $12.6 billion in 2017 increased 5% from $12.1 billion in 2016 due to higher project and technology spending on compliance and regulatory requirements, higher broker commissions, and higher employee benefits from deferred compensation plan expense (offset in deferred compensation plan investments). The provision for credit losses was flat in both 2018 and 2017.

The following discussions provide additional information for client assets we oversee in our retail brokerage advisory and trust and investment management business lines.

Retail Brokerage Client Assets Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees are received for providing full-service and discount brokerage services predominantly to retail brokerage clients. Offering advisory account relationships to our brokerage clients is an important component of our broader strategy of meeting their financial needs. Although a majority of our retail brokerage client assets are in accounts that earn brokerage commissions, the fees from those accounts generally 

represent transactional commissions based on the number and size of transactions executed at the client’s direction. Fees earned from advisory accounts are asset-based, are priced at the beginning of the quarter, and depend on changes in the value of the client’s assets as well as the level of assets resulting from inflows and outflows. A majority of our brokerage advisory, commissions and other fee income is earned from advisory accounts. Table 9d shows advisory account client assets as a percentage of total retail brokerage client assets at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Table 9d: Retail Brokerage Client Assets

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Retail Brokerage advisory accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. These advisory accounts generate fees as a percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the distinct 

services provided, and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the average fee rate by account type ranged from 80 to 120 basis points.

Balance Sheet Analysis

At December 31, 2018, our assets totaled $1.9 trillion, down $55.9 billion from December 31, 2017. Asset decline was predominantly due to interest-earning deposits with banks, which declined $42.8 billion. 

The following discussion provides additional information about the major components of our balance sheet. Information 

regarding our capital and changes in our asset mix is included in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” and “Capital Management” sections and Note 28 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities

Table 10: Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost.

Table 10 presents a summary of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, which decreased $1.0 billion in balance sheet carrying value from December 31, 2017, largely due to higher net unrealized losses, partially offset by purchases outpacing paydowns and maturities.

The total net unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018, down from net unrealized gains of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher interest rates and wider credit spreads.

The size and composition of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities is largely dependent upon the Company’s liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. Our business generates assets and liabilities, such as loans, deposits and long-term debt, which have different maturities, yields, re-pricing, prepayment characteristics and other provisions that expose us to interest rate and liquidity risk. 

The available-for-sale debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of liquid, high quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), privately-issued residential and commercial MBS, securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, and highly rated collateralized loan obligations. Due to its highly liquid nature, the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall economic or market conditions, which could influence loan origination demand, prepayment speeds, or deposit balances and mix. In response, the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio can be rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives, the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio may provide yield enhancement over other short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report for more information on liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio consists of high quality U.S. Treasury debt, securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions, agency MBS, asset-backed securities (ABS) primarily collateralized by automobile loans and leases and cash, and collateralized loan obligations where our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the contractual cash flows. The held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio may also provide yield enhancement over short-term assets.

We analyze debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) quarterly or more often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. In 2018, we recognized $28 million of OTTI write-downs on debt securities. For a discussion of our OTTI accounting policies and underlying considerations and analysis, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

At December 31, 2018, debt securities included $55.6 billion of municipal bonds, of which 93.4% were rated “A-” or better based predominantly on external and, in some cases, internal ratings. Additionally, some of the debt securities in our total municipal bond portfolio are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. These guaranteed bonds are predominantly investment grade and were generally underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards prior to the determination to purchase, without relying on the bond insurer’s guarantee in making the investment decision. The credit quality of our municipal bond holdings are monitored as part of our ongoing impairment analysis.

The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities available-for-sale was 6.2 years at December 31, 2018. The expected remaining maturity is shorter than the remaining contractual maturity for the 59.4% of this portfolio that is MBS because borrowers generally have the right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature. The estimated effects of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on the fair value and the expected remaining maturity of the MBS available-for-sale portfolio are shown in Table 11.

Loan Portfolios

Table 12 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by portfolio segment. Total loans decreased $3.7 billion from December 31, 2017, driven by a decline in consumer loans, partially offset by an increase in commercial loans. Commercial loan growth reflected growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial real estate loans reflecting continued credit discipline. The decrease in consumer loans reflected paydowns, sales of 1-4 family first mortgage PCI Pick-a-Pay loans, a continued decline in junior lien mortgage loans, the sale of Reliable Financial Services, Inc., and an expected decline in automobile loans as originations were more than offset by paydowns.

Deposits

Deposits were $1.3 trillion at December 31, 2018, down $49.8 billion from December 31, 2017, due to a decrease in commercial deposits from financial institutions and a decline in consumer and small business banking deposits. The decline in commercial deposits from financial institutions was due to actions taken in the first half of 2018 in response to the asset cap included in the consent order issued by the FRB on February 2, 2018, and declines across many businesses as 

commercial customers allocated more cash to higher-rate alternative investments. The decline in consumer and small business banking deposits was due to higher balance customers moving a portion of those balances to other cash alternatives offering higher rates. Table 14 provides additional information regarding deposits. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided in “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” and Table 5 earlier in this Report.

Table 14: Deposits

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Equity

Total equity was $197.1 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $208.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was driven by a $17.3 billion increase in treasury stock, a $4.2 billion decline in cumulative other comprehensive income predominantly due to fair value adjustments to available-for-sale 

securities caused by an increase in long-term interest rates, and a $2.1 billion decline in preferred stock, partially offset by a $12.9 billion increase in retained earnings from earnings net of dividends paid. The increase in treasury stock was the result of the repurchase of 375.5 million shares of common stock in 2018, an increase of 91% from 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources.

Commitments to Lend and Purchase Debt and Equity Securities

We enter into commitments to lend funds to customers, which are usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific purposes and time periods. When we make commitments, we are exposed to credit risk. However, the maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because a significant portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being used by the customer. For more information on lending commitments, see Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. We also enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. For more information on commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements, see Note 15 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. We also may enter into commitments to purchase debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ funding, liquidity or 

other future needs. For more information, see the “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements – Contractual Cash Obligations” section in this report and Note 15 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities

In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For more information on securitizations, including sales proceeds and cash flows from securitizations, see Note 9 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Guarantees and Certain Contingent Arrangements

Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities lending and other indemnifications, written put options, recourse obligations and other types of arrangements. For more information on guarantees and certain contingent arrangements, see Note 15 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 Wells Fargo & Company69

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (continued)

Derivatives

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. For more information on derivatives, see Note 17 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Other Commitments

We also have other off-balance sheet transactions, including obligations to make rental payments under noncancelable operating leases. Our operating lease obligations are discussed in Note 7 (Premises, Equipment, Lease Commitments and Other Assets) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Contractual Cash Obligations

In addition to the contractual commitments and arrangements previously described, which, depending on the nature of the obligation, may or may not require use of our resources, we enter into other contractual obligations that may require future cash payments in the ordinary course of business, including debt issuances for the funding of operations and leases for premises and equipment.

Table 15 summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, excluding the projected cash payments for obligations for short-term borrowing arrangements and pension and postretirement benefit plans. More information on those obligations is in Note 13 (Short-Term Borrowings) and Note 22 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

These interest obligations assume no early debt redemption. We estimated variable interest rate payments using December 31, 2018, rates, which we held constant until maturity. We have excluded interest related to structured notes where our payment obligation is contingent on the performance of certain benchmarks.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(5)Represents agreements related to unrecognized obligations to purchase goods or services.

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities, and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have various unrecognized tax obligations related to these operations that may require future cash tax payments to various taxing authorities. Because of their uncertain nature, the expected timing and amounts of these payments generally are not reasonably estimable or determinable. We attempt to estimate the amount payable in the next 12 months based on the status of our tax examinations and settlement discussions. See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for more information.

Transactions with Related Parties

The Related Party Disclosures topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 850 requires disclosure of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. Based on ASC 850, we had no transactions required to be reported for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company has included within its disclosures information on its equity securities, relationships with variable interest entities, and employee benefit plan arrangements. See Note 8 (Equity Securities), Note 9 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) and Note 22 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

70Wells Fargo & Company 

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, stockholders, regulators and other stakeholders. We operate under a Board approved risk management framework which outlines our company-wide approach to risk management and oversight and describes the structures and practices employed to manage current and emerging risks inherent to Wells Fargo. We believe that enhancements made during 2018 to our risk management framework transform and clarify our risk management approach by emphasizing the role of risk management when setting corporate strategy and by further rationalizing and integrating certain risk management organizational, governance and reporting practices.

Risk Management Framework

Our risk management framework defines how we manage risk in a comprehensive, integrated and consistent manner and lays out our vision for the risk management of the organization. It reinforces each team member’s personal accountability for risk management and is built on a foundation that begins with a deep understanding of the Company’s processes, risks and controls. Our risk management framework also supports members of senior management in achieving the Company’s strategic objectives and priorities, and it supports the Board as it carries out its risk oversight responsibilities.

The risk management framework consists of three lines of defense: (1) the front line which consists of Wells Fargo’s risk-generating activities, including all activities of its four primary business groups (Consumer Banking; Wholesale Banking; Wealth and Investment Management; and Payments, Virtual Solutions & Innovation) and certain activities of its enterprise functions (Human Resources, Enterprise Finance, Technology, Legal Department, Corporate Risk, Stakeholder Relations, and Wells Fargo Audit Services); (2) independent risk management, which consists of our Corporate Risk function and is led by our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who reports to the Board’s Risk Committee; and (3) internal audit, which is Wells Fargo Audit Services and is led by our Chief Auditor who reports to the Board’s Audit & Examination Committee. In addition to the three lines of defense, our risk management framework includes enterprise control activities, which are certain specialized activities performed within centralized enterprise functions (such as Human Resources and the Legal Department) with a focus on controlling specific risks. Key elements of our risk management framework include:

•A strong culture that emphasizes each team member’s ownership and understanding of risk. We want to cultivate an environment that expects and promotes robust communication and cooperation among the three lines of defense and supports identifying, escalating and addressing current and emerging risk issues. 

•A company-wide statement of risk appetite that guides business and risk leaders as they manage risk on a daily basis. The company-wide statement of risk appetite describes the nature and magnitude of risk that the Company is willing to assume in pursuit of its business and strategic objectives, consistent with capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.

•A risk management governance structure, including escalation requirements and a committee structure that helps provide comprehensive oversight of the risks we face. 

•A company-wide risk inventory that promotes a standardized and systematic process to identify and quantify risks at the business group and enterprise level to guide strategic business decisions and capital planning efforts.

•Policies, procedures, and controls which form an integrated risk management program that promotes active, prompt, and consistent identification, measurement, assessment, control, mitigation, reporting, and monitoring of current and emerging risk exposures across Wells Fargo and are integrated with clear enterprise risk roles and responsibilities for the three lines of defense.

•Three lines of defense that are closely integrated, each with specific roles and responsibilities for risk management and a clear engagement model that promotes challenge and appropriate escalation of issues and information. 

Board and Management-level Committee Structures

Wells Fargo’s Board committee and management-level governance committee structures are designed to ensure that key risks are identified and escalated and, if necessary, decided upon at the appropriate level of the Company. Accordingly, the structure is built upon defined escalation and reporting paths from the front line to independent risk management and management-level governance committees and, ultimately, to the Board as appropriate. Each management-level governance committee has defined escalation processes, authorities and responsibilities as outlined in its charter. Our Board committee and management-level governance committee structures, and the primary risk oversight responsibilities of each of those committees, is presented in Table 16.

 Wells Fargo & Company71

Table 16: Board and Management-level Governance Committee Structure 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The Audit & Examination Committee additionally oversees the internal audit function, external auditor independence, activities, and performance, and the disclosure framework for financial, regulatory and risk reports prepared for the Board, management, and bank regulatory agencies, and assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

(2)The Risk Committee has a compliance subcommittee and a technology subcommittee to assist it in providing oversight of those risks as discussed herein.

(3)Pursuant to their charters, many of the management-level governance committees have formed one or more sub-committees to address specific risk matters.

(4)Certain committees report to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee and have dual escalation and informational reporting paths to Board committees.

Board Oversight of Risk

The business and affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board, whose responsibilities include overseeing management’s implementation of the Company’s risk management framework and ongoing oversight and governance of the Company’s risk management activities. The Board carries out its risk oversight responsibilities directly and through the work of its seven standing committees, which all report to the full Board. Each Board committee works closely with management to understand and oversee the Company’s key risk exposures.

The Risk Committee oversees company-wide risks. The Board’s other standing committees also have primary oversight responsibility for certain specific risk matters, as highlighted in Table 16. 

The Risk Committee additionally oversees the Company’s Corporate Risk function and plays an active role in approving and overseeing the Company’s risk management framework. The Risk Committee and the full Board review and approve the enterprise statement of risk appetite annually, and the Risk Committee also actively monitors the Company’s risk profile relative to the approved risk appetite. 

The full Board receives reports at each of its regular meetings from the Board committee chairs about committee activities, including risk oversight matters, and the Risk Committee receives periodic reports from management regarding current or emerging risk matters.

72Wells Fargo & Company 

Management Oversight of Risk

The Company’s management-level governance committees are designed to enable understanding, consideration and decision-making of significant risk and control matters at the appropriate level of the Company and by the appropriate mix of executives. Each committee has a defined set of authorities and responsibilities as set forth in its charter, and each committee has defined escalation paths and risk reporting responsibilities, including to the Board or Board committees, as appropriate.

The Enterprise Risk & Control Committee is the

management-level governance committee that governs the management of financial risks, non-financial risks and enterprise and other risk programs. The Enterprise Risk & Control Committee is co-chaired by the Company’s CEO and CRO and has an escalation path to the Board’s Risk Committee. It considers and decides risk and control matters, addresses escalated issues, actively oversees risk mitigation, and provides regular updates to the Board’s Risk Committee regarding emerging risks and senior management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. It may escalate certain risk and control matters to other Board committees as appropriate based on their primary risk oversight responsibilities. 

Each business group and enterprise function has a Risk &

Control Committee that reports to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee and has a mandate that mirrors the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee but is limited to the relevant business group or enterprise function. These committees focus on the risks that each group or function generates and is responsible for managing, and on the controls that are expected to be in place. Additionally, there are standalone specific risk type- or program-specific risk governance committees reporting to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee to help provide complete and comprehensive governance for certain risk areas. 

While the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee and the committees that report to it serve as the focal point for the management of company-wide risk matters, the management of certain specific risk types is supported by additional management-level governance committees, which all report to at least one of the Board’s standing committees.

The Corporate Risk function, which is the Company’s independent risk management organization, is headed by the Company’s CRO who, among other things, is responsible for setting the strategic direction and driving the execution of Wells Fargo’s risk management activities. The Corporate Risk function provides senior management and the Board with an independent perspective of the level of risk to which the Company is exposed.

Corporate Risk develops the Company’s enterprise statement of risk appetite in the context of our risk management framework described above. As part of Wells Fargo’s risk appetite, we maintain metrics along with associated objectives to measure and monitor the amount of risk that the Company is prepared to take. Actual results of these metrics are reported to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee on a quarterly basis and to the Board’s Risk Committee. Our business groups also have business-specific risk appetite statements based on the enterprise statement of risk appetite. The metrics included in the business group statements are harmonized with the enterprise level metrics to ensure consistency where appropriate. Business lines also maintain metrics and qualitative statements that are unique to their line of business. This allows for monitoring of risk and definition of risk appetite deeper within the organization.

The Company’s senior management, including the CRO and Chief Auditor, work closely with the Board’s committees and 

provide ongoing reports and updates on risk matters during and outside of regular committee meetings, as appropriate.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is the risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal controls, processes, people and systems, or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in all Wells Fargo activities.

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including significant policies and programs regarding the Company’s business continuity, data management, information security, privacy, technology, and third-party risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee approves the operational risk statement of risk appetite including inner and outer boundary thresholds, reviews and approves significant operational risk policies, and oversees the Company’s ongoing operational risk management program.

At the management level, the Operational Risk function, which is part of Corporate Risk, has primary oversight responsibility for operational risk. The Operational Risk function reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to operational risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. Within the Operational Risk function, Information Security Risk Management has oversight responsibility for information security risk, and Technology Risk Management Oversight has oversight responsibility for technology risk. Oversight of data management risk, an operational risk, is an enterprise control activity performed within the Data Management & Insight function, and oversight of human capital risk, an operational risk, is an enterprise control activity performed within the Human Resources function. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports operational risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee.

Information security is a significant operational risk for financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, and includes the risk resulting from cyber attacks and other information security events relating to Wells Fargo technology, systems, networks, and data that would disrupt Wells Fargo’s businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential data which could damage Wells Fargo’s reputation, cause losses or increase costs. Wells Fargo’s Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the Company’s information security risk management and cyber defense programs. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for information security risk and approves the Company’s information security program, which includes the information security policy and the cyber defense program. The Risk Committee formed a Technology Subcommittee to assist it in providing oversight of technology, information security, and cyber risks as well as data management risk. The Technology Subcommittee reviews and recommends to the Risk Committee for approval any significant supporting information security (including cybersecurity) risk, technology risk, and data management risk programs and/or policies, including the Company’s data management strategy. The Technology Subcommittee reports to the Risk Committee and both provide updates to the full Board.

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware and denial-of-service, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, potentially test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services,

such as online banking, as well as cloud-based services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. Wells Fargo has not experienced any material losses relating to these or other types of cyber attacks. Cybersecurity risk is a priority for Wells Fargo, and we continue to develop and enhance our controls, processes and systems in order to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Wells Fargo is also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional information regarding the risks associated with a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks.

Compliance Risk Management

Compliance risk is the risk resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules, and other regulatory requirements, and the failure to appropriately address and limit violations of law and any associated impact to customers. Compliance risk encompasses other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking industry as well as nonconformance with applicable internal policies and procedures.

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee approves the compliance risk and financial crimes risk statement of risk appetites including inner and outer boundary thresholds, reviews and approves significant compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs, and oversees the Company’s ongoing compliance risk management and financial crimes risk management programs. The Compliance Subcommittee of the Risk Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of the Company’s compliance program and compliance risk management. The Compliance Subcommittee reports to the Risk Committee and both provide updates to the full Board.

At the management level, Wells Fargo Compliance, which is part of Corporate Risk, monitors the implementation of the Company’s compliance program. Financial Crimes Risk Management, which is part of Wells Fargo Compliance, oversees and monitors financial crimes risk. Wells Fargo Compliance reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee and Compliance Subcommittee. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports compliance risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee. We continue to enhance our oversight of operational and compliance risk management, including as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, consent orders.

Conduct Risk Management

Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk resulting from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of team members or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, caused by deliberate actions or business practices.

The Board has enhanced its oversight of conduct risk to oversee the alignment of team member conduct to the Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually) and culture as reflected in our Vision, Values & Goals and Code 

of Ethics and Business Conduct. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for company-wide conduct risk and risk management components of the Company’s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board’s Human Resources Committee include oversight of the Company’s company-wide culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, conflicts of interest program, human capital management (including talent management and succession planning), performance management program, and incentive compensation risk management program.

At the management level, the Conduct Management Office has primary oversight responsibility for key elements of conduct risk, including internal investigations, sales practices oversight, complaints oversight, and ethics oversight. The Conduct Management Office reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to conduct risk to the relevant Board committees. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports conduct risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee.

The Company’s incentive compensation risk management program is overseen by the management-level Incentive Compensation Committee, which is chaired by the Head of Human Resources and provides periodic reporting related to incentive compensation risk to the Board’s Human Resources Committee. The Human Resources function, which reports to the CEO, also oversees the Company’s culture program, which promotes compliance with laws, consideration of risks when making decisions, and facilitates open dialogue and transparency among the lines of defense.

Strategic Risk Management

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, and/or liquidity

arising from adverse or poorly executed business decisions or ill-timed or inadequate responses to changes in the internal and

external operating environment. 

The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic planning and oversees management’s development and implementation of and approves the Company’s strategic plan, and considers whether it is aligned with the Company’s risk appetite. Management develops, executes and recommends strategic corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management’s proposals, including their impact on the Company’s risk profile and financial position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the adequacy of the Company’s

strategic risk management program, including associated risk

management practices, processes and controls. The Board’s

Risk Committee also reviews and approves significant strategic

risk governance documents, and receives periodic reporting from management regarding risks related to new products, and changes to products, as appropriate.

At the management level, the Strategic Risk function, which

is part of Corporate Risk, has primary oversight responsibility for strategic risk. The Strategic Risk function reports into the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to strategic risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. In addition, the Risk & Control

Committee for each business group and enterprise function

reports strategic risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control

Committee.

Model Risk Management

Model risk is the risk arising from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs or reports.

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight 

74Wells Fargo & Company 

responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the Company’s model risk management policy, model validation activities, model performance, model issue remediation status, and adherence to model risk appetite metrics.

At the management level, the Corporate Model Risk function, which is part of Corporate Risk, has primary oversight responsibility for model risk and is responsible for ongoing governance, validation and monitoring of model risk across the Company. The Corporate Model Risk function reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to model risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports model risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee.

Reputation Risk Management

Reputation risk is the risk arising from negative perceptions by

stakeholders, whether real or not, resulting in potential loss of

trust in the Company’s competence or integrity. Key external stakeholders include customers, potential and non-customers, shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and the media.

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight

responsibility for company-wide reputation risk, while each

Board committee has reputation risk oversight responsibilities

related to their primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its

oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives reports from management that help it monitor how effectively the Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee also receives reports from management relating to the Company’s brand and stakeholder perception of the Company.

At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight

function, which is part of Corporate Risk, has primary oversight responsibility for reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight

function reports into the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to reputation risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports reputation risk

matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee.

Credit Risk Management

We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Credit Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, the Corporate Credit function, which is part of Corporate Risk, has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Corporate Credit function reports to the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to credit risk to the Board’s Credit Committee. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports credit risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee.

The following discussion focuses on our loan portfolios, which represent the largest component of assets on our balance sheet for which we have credit risk. Table 17 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

Table 17: Total Loans Outstanding by Portfolio Segment and Class of Financing Receivable

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate including: 

•Loan concentrations and related credit quality

•Counterparty credit risk

•Economic and market conditions

•Legislative or regulatory mandates

•Changes in interest rates

•Merger and acquisition activities

•Reputation risk

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed centrally, but provides for decentralized management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process.

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

 Wells Fargo & Company75

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued)

Credit Quality Overview  Solid credit quality continued in 2018, as our net charge-off rate remained low at 0.29% of average total loans. We continued to benefit from improvements in the performance of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios. In particular:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit quality trends follows.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS  Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are PCI loans. Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired in the Wachovia acquisition on December 31, 2008. PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the historical allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over. The carrying value of PCI loans at December 31, 2018, totaled $5.0 billion, compared with $12.8 billion at December 31, 2017, and $58.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease from December 31, 2017, was due to the sales of $6.2 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans during 2018, as well as portfolio runoff. PCI loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield amount, which represents the cash expected to be collected in excess of their carrying value, and not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments. The accretable yield at December 31, 2018, was $3.0 billion.

A nonaccretable difference is established for PCI loans to absorb losses expected on the contractual amounts of those loans in excess of the fair value recorded at the date of acquisition. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2018, $480 million in nonaccretable difference remained to absorb losses on PCI loans. 

For additional information on PCI loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Real Estate 1-4 Family First and Junior Lien Mortgage Loans – Pick-a-Pay Portfolio” section in this Report, Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ) and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each of the following portfolios.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized divided among special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories.

The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio totaled $369.9 billion, or 39% of total loans, at December 31, 2018. The net charge-off rate for this portfolio was 0.13% in 2018, compared with 0.15% in 2017. At December 31, 2018, 0.43% of this portfolio was nonaccruing, compared with 0.56% at December 31, 2017, reflecting a decrease of $399 million in nonaccrual loans, predominantly due to credit improvement in the oil and gas portfolio. Also, $15.8 billion of the commercial and industrial loan and lease financing portfolio was internally classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2018, compared with $17.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in criticized loans, which also includes the decrease in nonaccrual loans, was mostly due to improvement in the oil and gas portfolio.

Most of our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a secondary source of repayment.

Table 18 provides a breakout of commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry, and includes $63.7 billion of foreign loans at December 31, 2018. Foreign loans totaled $21.8 billion within the investors category, $19.1 billion within the financial institutions category and $1.2 billion within the oil and gas category.

The investors category includes loans to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) formed by sponsoring entities to invest in financial assets backed predominantly by commercial and residential real estate or corporate cash flow, and are repaid from the asset cash flows or the sale of assets by the SPV. We limit loan amounts to a percentage of the value of the underlying assets, as determined by us, based on analysis of underlying 

76Wells Fargo & Company 

credit risk and other factors such as asset duration and ongoing performance.

We provide financial institutions with a variety of relationship focused products and services, including loans supporting short-term trade finance and working capital needs. The $19.1 billion of foreign loans in the financial institutions category were predominantly originated by our Corporate and Investment Banking business.

The oil and gas loan portfolio totaled $12.2 billion, or 1% of total outstanding loans at December 31, 2018, compared with $12.5 billion, or 1% of total outstanding loans at December 31, 2017. Oil and gas nonaccrual loans decreased to $416 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, due to continued credit improvement in the portfolio.

Table 18: Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing by Industry (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Industry categories are based on the North American Industry Classification System and the amounts reported include foreign loans. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for a breakout of commercial foreign loans.

(2)Includes $4 million PCI loans, which are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments.

(3)No other single industry had total loans in excess of $6.0 billion.

Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and our assessment of the borrower’s ability to perform under the agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of 

collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside repayment guarantee in providing the extension.

Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the most current financial information available and is focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us based on our analysis as well as other lenders’ experience with the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance methodology.

In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate the collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included $7.7 billion of foreign CRE loans, totaled $143.5 billion, or 15% of total loans, at December 31, 2018, and consisted of $121.0 billion of mortgage loans and $22.5 billion of construction loans. 

Table 19 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type with the related nonaccrual totals. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida and Texas, which combined represented 50% of the total CRE portfolio. By property type, the largest concentrations are office buildings at 27% and apartments at 16% of the portfolio. CRE nonaccrual loans totaled 0.4% of the CRE outstanding balance at December 31, 2018, compared with 0.4% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, we had $4.5 billion of criticized CRE mortgage loans, compared with $4.3 billion at December 31, 2017, and $289 million of criticized CRE construction loans, compared with $298 million at December 31, 2017.

(2)Mixed use properties are primarily owner occupied real estate, including data centers, flexible space leased to multiple tenants, light manufacturing and other specialized uses.

FOREIGN LOANS AND COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE We classify loans for financial statement and certain regulatory purposes as foreign primarily based on whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United States. At December 31, 2018, foreign loans totaled $71.9 billion, representing approximately 8% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $70.4 billion, or approximately 7% of total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2017. Foreign loans were approximately 4% of our consolidated total assets at both December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

Our country risk monitoring process incorporates frequent dialogue with our financial institution customers, counterparties and regulatory agencies, enhanced by centralized monitoring of macroeconomic and capital markets conditions in the respective countries. We establish exposure limits for each country through a centralized oversight process based on customer needs, and in consideration of relevant economic, political, social, legal, and transfer risks. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing conditions.

We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk such as guarantees and collateral and may be different from the reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. Our largest single foreign country exposure based on our assessment of risk at December 31, 2018, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 

$27.2 billion, or approximately 1% of our total assets, and included $3.1 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom sovereign claims arise predominantly from deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. The United Kingdom officially announced its intention to leave the European Union (Brexit) on March 29, 2017, starting the two-year negotiation process leading to its departure. We continue to implement plans for Brexit. Our primary goal is to continue to serve our existing clients in the United Kingdom and the European Union as well as to continue to meet the needs of our domestic clients as they do business in the United Kingdom and the European Union. We have an existing authorized bank in Ireland and an asset management entity in Luxembourg. We are also in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to establish a broker dealer in France. We continue to explore options to leverage these entities in order to continue to serve clients in the European Union. In addition, the impact of Brexit on our supplier contracts, staffing and business operations in the European Union is subject to an ongoing review, and we are implementing mitigating actions where possible. For additional information on risks associated with Brexit, see the “Risk Factors” section in this Report.

Table 20 provides information regarding our top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) and our Eurozone exposure, based on our assessment of risk, which gives 

78Wells Fargo & Company 

consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying collateral.

Table 20: Select Country Exposures

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Lending exposure includes funded loans and unfunded commitments, leveraged leases, and money market placements presented on a gross basis prior to the deduction of impairment allowance and collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements. For the countries listed above, there are $478 million in defeased leases secured significantly by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities.

(2)Represents exposure on debt and equity securities of foreign issuers. Long and short positions are netted and net short positions are reflected as negative exposure.

(3)Represents counterparty exposure on foreign exchange and derivative contracts, and securities resale and lending agreements. This exposure is presented net of counterparty netting adjustments and reduced by the amount of cash collateral. It includes credit default swaps (CDS) predominantly used for market making activities in the U.S. and London based trading businesses, which sometimes results in selling and purchasing protection on the identical reference entities. Generally, we do not use market instruments such as CDS to hedge the credit risk of our investment or loan positions, although we do use them to manage risk in our trading businesses. At December 31, 2018, the gross notional amount of our CDS sold that reference assets in the Top 20 or Eurozone countries was $332 million, which was offset by the notional amount of CDS purchased of $484 million. We did not have any CDS purchased or sold that reference pools of assets that contain sovereign debt or where the reference asset was solely the sovereign debt of a foreign country.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY FIRST AND JUNIOR LIEN MORTGAGE LOANS  Our real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans, as presented in Table 21, include loans we have made to customers and retained as part of our asset/liability management strategy, the Pick-a-Pay portfolio acquired 

from Wachovia which is discussed later in this Report and other purchased loans, and loans included on our balance sheet as a result of consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).

Table 21: Real Estate 1-4 Family First and Junior Lien Mortgage Loans

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were approximately 4% of total loans at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. We believe we have manageable adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our owned mortgage loan portfolios. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. The option ARMs we do have are included in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio which was acquired from Wachovia. For more information, see the “Pick-a-Pay Portfolio” section in this Report.

We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Loans are generally underwritten at the time of the modification in accordance with underwriting guidelines established for our loan modification programs. Under these programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after successful completion and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is permanently modified. Loans included under these programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the start of a trial period or at the time of permanent modification, if no trial period is used. See the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this Report for discussion on how we determine the allowance attributable to our modified residential real estate portfolios.

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio. These credit risk indicators, which exclude government insured/guaranteed loans, continued to improve in 2018 on the non-PCI mortgage portfolio. Loans 30 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2018, totaled $4.0 billion, or 1% of total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $5.3 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2017. Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 totaled $9.7 billion, or 3% of total non-PCI mortgages at December 31, 2018, compared with $11.7 billion, or 4%, at December 31, 2017. Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018, or 1% of total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $6.1 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2017. Information regarding credit quality indicators, including PCI credit quality indicators, can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans by state are presented in Table 22. Our real estate 1-4 family non-PCI mortgage loans to borrowers in California represented 12% of total loans at December 31, 2018, located predominantly within the larger metropolitan areas, with no single California metropolitan area consisting of more than 5% of total loans. We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage portfolios as part of our credit risk management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of loans and lines secured by residential real estate collateral includes appraisals or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of large numbers of properties in a short period of time using market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of an individual property may vary significantly from the average for the market area. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used. AVMs are not allowed in real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage origination underwriting. Broker evaluations and enhanced desktop appraisal reports are allowed in junior lien originations and some first lien line of credit originations up to $250,000. An appraisal is required for all real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage commitments greater than $250,000. Additional information about AVMs and our policy for their use can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

(2)Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

First Lien Mortgage Portfolio  Our total real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage portfolio increased $1.0 billion in 2018, as growth in held for investment nonconforming mortgage loans was partially offset by payoffs and Pick-a-Pay PCI loan sales of $6.2 billion. In addition, $1.3 billion of nonconforming mortgage loan originations that would have otherwise been included in this portfolio, were designated as held for sale in 2018 in anticipation of the future issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities. We retained $42.0 billion in nonconforming originations, consisting of loans that exceed conventional conforming loan amount limits established by federal government-sponsored entities (GSEs) in 2018.

The credit performance associated with our real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage portfolio continued to improve in 2018, as measured through net charge-offs and nonaccrual loans. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage loans improved to a net recovery of 0.03% in 2018, compared with a net recovery of 0.02% in 2017. Nonaccrual loans were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $3.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2017, was driven by nonaccrual loan sales and an improving housing environment.

Pick-a-Pay Portfolio  The Pick-a-Pay portfolio was one of the consumer residential first lien mortgage portfolios we acquired from Wachovia and a majority of the portfolio was identified as PCI loans.

The Pick-a-Pay portfolio is included in the consumer real estate 1-4 family first mortgage class of loans throughout this Report. Table 24 provides balances by types of loans as of December 31, 2018. As a result of our loan modification and loss mitigation efforts as well as borrower payoffs, Pick-a-Pay option payment loans have been reduced to $8.8 billion at December 31, 2018, from $99.9 billion at acquisition. Total 

adjusted unpaid principal balance of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans was $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $61.0 billion at acquisition. Due to loan modification and loss mitigation efforts as well as borrower payoffs, the adjusted unpaid principal balance of option payment PCI loans has declined to 19% of the total Pick-a-Pay portfolio at December 31, 2018, compared with 51% at acquisition. As favorable sale opportunities arise, we may sell portions of this portfolio. We expect to close on the sale of approximately $2.4 billion unpaid principal balance of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans in first quarter 2019.

Table 24: Pick-a-Pay Portfolio – Comparison to Acquisition Date

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.

Pick-a-Pay option payment loans may have fixed or adjustable rates with payment options that include a minimum payment, an interest-only payment or fully amortizing payment (both 15- and 30-year options).

Since December 31, 2008, we have completed over 138,000 proprietary and Home Affordability Modification Program (HAMP) Pick-a-Pay loan modifications, which have resulted in over $6.1 billion of principal forgiveness. We have also provided interest rate reductions and loan term extensions to enable sustainable homeownership for our Pick-a-Pay customers. 

The predominant portion of our PCI loans is included in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Our cash flows expected to be collected have been favorably affected over time by lower expected defaults and losses as a result of observed and forecasted economic strengthening, particularly in housing prices, and our loan modification efforts. Since acquisition, we have reclassified $9.3 billion from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield. Fluctuations in the accretable yield are driven by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, prepayment assumptions, and expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life of the portfolio, which will be affected by the pace and degree of improvements in the U.S. economy and housing markets and projected lifetime performance resulting from loan modification activity. Changes in the projected timing of cash flow events, including loan liquidations, prepayments, modifications and short sales, can also affect the accretable yield and the estimated weighted-average life of the portfolio.

During 2018, we sold $6.2 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans that resulted in a gain of $2.4 billion. The accretable yield balance related to our Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio declined $5.9 billion during 2018, driven by realized accretion of $1.0 billion, $2.4 billion from the gain on the loan sales, a $2.1 billion reduction in expected interest cash flows resulting from the loan sales, and a $752 million reduction in cash flows resulting from higher prepayments, partially offset by a $372 million reclassification from nonaccretable difference. An increase in expected prepayments and passage of time lowered our estimated weighted-average life to approximately 5.5 years at December 31, 2018, from 6.8 years at December 31, 2017. The accretable yield percentage for Pick-a-Pay PCI loans for fourth quarter 2018 was 11.47%, up from 9.83% in fourth quarter 2017, due to an increase in the amount of accretable yield relative to the shortened weighted-average life. Based on loan sales in fourth quarter 2018, we expect the accretable yield percentage to increase to approximately 11.49% for first quarter 2019.

Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio The junior lien mortgage portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It is not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, interest only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are mostly amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years. 

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of loss. We have observed that the severity of loss for junior lien mortgages is high and generally not affected by whether we or a third party own or service the related first lien mortgage, but the frequency of delinquency is typically lower when we own or service the first lien mortgage. In general, we have limited information available on the delinquency status of the third party owned or serviced first lien where we also hold a junior lien. To capture this inherent loss content, our allowance process for junior lien mortgages considers the relative difference in loss experience for junior lien mortgages behind first lien mortgage loans we own or service, compared with those behind first lien mortgage loans owned or serviced by third parties. In addition, our allowance process for junior lien mortgages that are current, but are in 

their revolving period, considers the inherent loss where the borrower is delinquent on the corresponding first lien mortgage loans.

Table 25 shows certain delinquency and loss information for the junior lien mortgage portfolio and lists the top five states by outstanding balance. The decrease in outstanding balances since December 31, 2017, predominantly reflects loan paydowns. As of December 31, 2018, 6% of the outstanding balance of the junior lien mortgage portfolio was associated with loans that had a combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. Of those junior lien mortgages with a CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 2.93% were 30 days or more past due. CLTV means the ratio of the total loan balance of first lien mortgages and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. The unsecured portion (the outstanding amount that was in excess of the most recent property collateral value) of the outstanding balances of these loans totaled 2% of the junior lien mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2018. For additional information on consumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 6.12 in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued)

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit portfolios generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options during the draw period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. During the draw period, the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance.

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics of borrowers in our first and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In December 2018, approximately 44% of these borrowers paid only the minimum amount due and approximately 50% paid more than the minimum amount due. The rest were either delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. For the borrowers with an interest only payment feature, approximately 

30% paid only the minimum amount due and approximately 63% paid more than the minimum amount due.

The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this increased inherent risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate.

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy.

Table 26 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of junior lien mortgages, including lines and loans, and first lien lines segregated into scheduled end of draw or end of term periods and products that are currently amortizing, or in balloon repayment status. It excludes real estate 1-4 family first lien line reverse mortgages, which total $109 million, because they are predominantly insured by the FHA, and it excludes PCI loans, which total $34 million, because their losses were generally reflected in our nonaccretable difference established at the date of acquisition.

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $39.0 billion at December 31, 2018, which represented 4% of our total outstanding loans. The net charge-off rate for our credit card portfolio was 3.51% for 2018, compared with 3.49% for 2017.

AUTOMOBILE  Our automobile portfolio, predominantly composed of indirect loans, totaled $45.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The net charge-off rate for our automobile portfolio was 1.21% for 2018, compared with 1.18% for 2017. 

OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other revolving credit and installment loans totaled $36.1 billion at December 31, 2018, and primarily included student and securities-based loans. Our private student loan portfolio totaled $11.2 billion at December 31, 2018. The net charge-off rate for other revolving credit and installment loans was 1.53% for 2018, compared with 1.52% for 2017.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS) Table 27 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for each of the last five years. We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when:

•the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances;

•they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest or principal, unless both well-secured and in the process of collection;

•part of the principal balance has been charged off; or

•for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 

process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien delinquency status.

Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due.

Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Loans) to Financial Statements in this Report describes our accounting policy for nonaccrual and impaired loans.

Nonaccrual loans were $6.5 billion at December 31, 2018, down $1.2 billion from a year ago, due to a $413 million decrease in commercial and industrial nonaccruals reflecting continued credit improvement in the portfolio, as well as a decrease of $690 million in consumer real estate nonaccruals.

Table 27: Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2)Excludes PCI loans because they continue to earn interest income from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms.

(3)Real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed.

(4)See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for further information on impaired loans.

(5)Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. However, both principal and interest related to these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Foreclosure of certain government guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans that meet criteria specified by Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-14, Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure, effective as of January 1, 2014, are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For more information on the classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Table 29 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual loans.

Table 29: Analysis of Changes in Nonaccrual Loans 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities. Also, reductions can come from borrower repayments even if the loan remains on nonaccrual.

While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we believe exposure to loss is significantly mitigated by the following factors at December 31, 2018:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•82% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest, but were on nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of interest or principal had become uncertain.

•72% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on both principal and interest, but will remain on nonaccrual status until the full and timely collection of principal and interest becomes certain.

•the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been considered and we believe is adequately covered by the allowance for loan losses. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We continue to work with our customers experiencing financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under our proprietary modification programs, customers may be required to provide updated documentation, and some programs require completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate sustained performance before the loan can be removed from nonaccrual status. 

If interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that were, but are no longer on nonaccrual at year end) had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $446 million of interest would have been recorded as income on these loans, compared with $426 million actually recorded as interest income in 2018, versus $500 million and $395 million, respectively, in 2017.

(1)Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. The net change in government insured/guaranteed foreclosed assets is generally made up of inflows from mortgages held for investment and MLHFS, and outflows when we are reimbursed by FHA/VA. 

(2)Includes loans moved into foreclosure from nonaccrual status, PCI loans transitioned directly to foreclosed assets and repossessed automobiles.

Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2018, included $317 million of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 28% is predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to have minimal or no loss content. The remaining foreclosed assets balance of $134 million has been written down to estimated net realizable value. Of the $451 million in foreclosed assets at December 31, 2018, 65% have been in the foreclosed assets portfolio one year or less.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)

Table 31: Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table 32: TDRs Balance by Quarter During 2018

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table 31 and Table 32 provide information regarding the recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information regarding TDRs. In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such 

forgiveness is immediately charged off to the extent not done so prior to the modification. When we delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible.

Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan types when a restructuring is involved. We typically

 Wells Fargo & Company89

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued)

re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other factors. Loans lacking sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to accruing status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or 

equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual, and a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the modified agreement will not be collectible.

Table 33 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan. 

Table 33: Analysis of Changes in TDRs

(1)Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving commercial TDRs that modified in a prior period.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal are still accruing if they are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days past due. PCI loans are not included in past due and still accruing loans even when they are 90 days or more contractually past due. These PCI loans are considered to be accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their contractual terms.

Excluding insured/guaranteed loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2018, were down $78 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2017, due to payoffs, modifications and other loss mitigation activities and credit stabilization. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA for mortgages were $7.7 billion at December 31, 2018, down from $10.5 billion at December 31, 2017, due to an improvement in delinquencies, loan modification activity, as well as runoff. All remaining student loans guaranteed by agencies on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education under the FFELP were sold as of March 31, 2017.

Table 34 reflects non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed. For additional information on delinquencies by loan class, see Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

NET CHARGE-OFFS

Table 35: Net Charge-offs 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Quarterly net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized.

Table 35 presents net charge-offs for the four quarters and full year of 2018 and 2017. Net charge-offs in 2018 were $2.7 billion (0.29% of average total loans outstanding), compared with $2.9 billion (0.31%) in 2017. 

The decrease in commercial and industrial net charge-offs in 2018 reflected continued improvement in our oil and gas portfolio. Our commercial real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position every quarter in 2018 and 2017. Total net charge-offs decreased from the prior year across all consumer portfolios, except for the credit card portfolio, which had a slight increase.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The allowance for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried at fair value. The detail of the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This 

process takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use several analytical tools. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength, and the severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of any underlying collateral. Probability of default and severity at the time of default are statistically derived through historical observations of defaults and losses after default within each credit risk rating. Our estimation approach for the consumer portfolio uses forecasted losses that represent our best estimate of inherent loss based on historical experience, quantitative and other mathematical techniques. For additional information on our allowance for credit losses, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Table 36 presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan segment and class for the last five years.

Table 36: Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018, has been revised to exclude MLHFS, LHFS and loans held at fair value from nonaccrual loans.

In addition to the allowance for credit losses, there was $480 million at December 31, 2018, and $474 million at December 31, 2017, of nonaccretable difference to absorb losses for PCI loans, which totaled $5.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses is lower than otherwise would have been required without PCI loan accounting. As a result of PCI loans, certain ratios of the Company may not be directly comparable with credit-related metrics for other financial institutions. Additionally, loans purchased at fair value, including loans from the GE Capital business acquisitions in 2016, generally reflect a lifetime credit loss adjustment and therefore do not initially require additions to the allowance as is typically associated with loan growth. For additional information on PCI loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans” section, Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the 

portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and marketability of collateral. 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2018, due to continued improvement in the credit quality of our residential real estate portfolios and a decrease in allowance for our automobile portfolio reflecting an improvement in our outlook for hurricane-related losses in Puerto Rico, partially offset by an increase in allowance for the credit card portfolio. Total provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion in 2018, $2.5 billion in 2017, and $3.8 billion in 2016. The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion less than net charge-offs in 2018, reflecting the same changes mentioned above for the allowance for credit losses, compared with $400 million less than net charge-offs in 2017. The 2016 provision was $250 million more than net charge-offs.

We believe the allowance for credit losses of $10.7 billion at December 31, 2018, was appropriate to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is subject to change and reflects 

 Wells Fargo & Company93

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued)

existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Future allowance levels will be based on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  

We sell residential mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. 

In connection with our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Our mortgage repurchase liability estimation process also incorporates a forecast of repurchase demands associated with mortgage insurance rescission activity.

The overall level of unresolved repurchase demands and mortgage insurance rescissions outstanding at December 31, 2018, was $49 million, representing 230 loans, down from $108 million, or 482 loans, a year ago both in number of outstanding loans and in total dollar balances. The decrease was predominantly due to private investor demands resolved in third quarter 2018.

Customary with industry practice, we have the right of recourse against correspondent lenders from whom we have purchased loans with respect to representations and warranties. Historical recovery rates as well as projected lender performance are incorporated in the establishment of our mortgage repurchase liability.

We do not typically receive repurchase requests from GNMA, FHA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or VA. As an originator of an FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed loan, we are responsible for obtaining the insurance with the FHA or the guarantee with the VA. To the extent we are not able to obtain the insurance or the guarantee we must request permission to repurchase the loan from the GNMA pool. Such repurchases from GNMA pools typically represent a self-initiated process upon discovery of the uninsurable loan (usually within 180 days from funding of the 

loan). Alternatively, in lieu of repurchasing loans from GNMA pools, we may be asked by FHA/HUD or the VA to indemnify them (as applicable) for defects found in the Post Endorsement Technical Review process or audits performed by FHA/HUD or the VA. The Post Endorsement Technical Review is a process whereby HUD performs underwriting audits of closed/insured FHA loans for potential deficiencies. Our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses incorporates probable losses associated with such indemnification.

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. The following discussion summarizes the primary duties and requirements of servicing and related industry developments.

The loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and (6) for loans sold into private label securitizations, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, (2) consult with each servicer and use reasonable efforts to cause the servicer to observe its servicing obligations, (3) prepare monthly distribution statements to security holders and, if required by the securitization documents, certain periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC, (4) if required by the securitization documents, calculate distributions and loss allocations on the mortgage-backed securities, (5) prepare tax and information returns of the securitization trust, and (6) advance amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations.

Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities we incur when acting in compliance with the specified standard. For example, private label securitization agreements under which we act as servicer or master servicer typically provide that the servicer and the master servicer are entitled to indemnification by the securitization trust for taking action or refraining from taking action in good faith or for errors in judgment. However, we are not indemnified, but rather are required to indemnify the securitization trustee, against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or against any of our acts or omissions that involve willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, our duties. In addition, if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice, which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders. Whole loan sale contracts under which we act as servicer generally include similar provisions 

94Wells Fargo & Company 

with respect to our actions as servicer. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, as well as can impose certain monetary penalties on us.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors (Board), which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. At the management level we utilize a Corporate Asset/Liability Management Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of senior financial, risk, and business executives, to oversee these risks and report on them periodically to the Board’s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk, which potentially can have a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk because:

•assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times (for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase);

•assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts (for example, when the general level of interest rates is rising, we may increase rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general rise in market interest rates);

•short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently);

•the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income); or

•interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments, the value of the pension liability and other items affecting earnings.

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies.

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest income will benefit modestly from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities. 

Our most recent simulations estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower and higher interest rates. Measured impacts from standardized ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (instantaneous changes) are summarized in Table 37, indicating net interest income sensitivity relative to the Company’s base net interest income plan. Ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one, and the full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the base scenario in year two. The following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 37:

•Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth across assets and liabilities.

•Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant.

•Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates.

•Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding products could reduce expected net interest income.

•We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios.

The sensitivity results above do not capture interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense is predominantly driven by mortgage activity, and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. Typically, in response to higher interest rates, mortgage activity, primarily refinancing activity, generally declines. And in response to lower interest rates, mortgage activity generally increases. Mortgage results are also impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for more information.

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Furthermore, for the trading portfolio, interest rate changes may result in net interest income compression (generally as interest rates rise) or expansion (generally as interest rates fall) that does not reflect the offsetting effects of certain economic hedges. Instead, as a result of GAAP requirements, the effects of such economic hedges are recorded in noninterest income.

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposures. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in this Report for more information on the use of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. The notional or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, are presented in Note 17 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways:

•to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and

•to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, forwards and options.

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a majority of the long-term fixed-rate mortgage and ARM loans we originate. On the other hand, we may hold originated ARMs and fixed-rate mortgage loans in our loan portfolio as an investment for our deposits. We determine whether the loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment. We may subsequently change our intent to hold loans for investment and sell some or all of our ARMs or fixed-rate mortgages as part of our corporate asset/liability management. We may also acquire and add to our securities available for sale a portion of the securities issued at the time we securitize MLHFS.

Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates may potentially reduce total origination and servicing fees, the value of our residential MSRs measured at fair value, the value of MLHFS and the associated income and loss reflected in mortgage banking noninterest income, the income and expense associated with instruments (economic hedges) used to hedge changes in the fair value of MSRs and MLHFS, and the value of derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants.

Interest rates affect the amount and timing of origination and servicing fees because consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity are sensitive to changes in mortgage interest rates. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and may also lead to an increase in servicing fee income, depending on the level of new loans added to the servicing portfolio and prepayments. Given the time it takes for consumer behavior to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will affect origination and servicing fees with a lag. The amount and timing of the impact on origination and servicing fees will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the change in interest rates.

We measure originations of MLHFS at fair value where an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support fair value pricing models used for these loans. Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We also measure at fair value certain of our other interests held related to residential loan sales and securitizations. We believe fair value measurement for MLHFS and other interests held, which we hedge with free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) along with our MSRs measured at fair value, reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. During 2016, 2017, and 2018, in response to continued secondary market illiquidity, as well as our desire to retain high quality loans on our balance sheet, we continued to originate certain prime non-agency loans to be substantially held for investment. We did however designate a small portion of our non-agency originations in 2018 to MLHFS in support of future issuances of private label residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). We issued $441 million of RMBS in fourth quarter 2018.

We initially measure all of our MSRs at fair value and carry substantially all of them at fair value depending on our strategy for managing interest rate risk. Under this method, the MSRs are recorded at fair value at the time we sell or securitize the 

96Wells Fargo & Company 

related mortgage loans. The carrying value of MSRs carried at fair value reflects changes in fair value at the end of each quarter and changes are included in net servicing income, a component of mortgage banking noninterest income. If the fair value of the MSRs increases, income is recognized; if the fair value of the MSRs decreases, a loss is recognized. We use a dynamic and sophisticated model to estimate the fair value of our MSRs and periodically benchmark our estimates to independent appraisals. The valuation of MSRs can be highly subjective and involve complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional information. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of MSRs, including prepayment speeds, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements.

An increase in interest rates generally reduces the propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand and, therefore, reduce origination income. A decline in interest rates generally increases the propensity for refinancing, reduces the expected duration of the servicing portfolio and therefore reduces the estimated fair value of MSRs. This reduction in fair value causes a charge to income for MSRs carried at fair value, net of any gains on free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge MSRs. We may choose not to fully hedge the entire potential decline in the value of our MSRs resulting from a decline in interest rates because the potential increase in origination/servicing fees in that scenario provides a partial “natural business hedge.” 

The price risk associated with our MSRs is economically hedged with a combination of highly liquid interest rate forward instruments including mortgage forward contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate options. All of the instruments included in the hedge are marked to fair value daily. Because the hedging instruments are traded in predominantly highly liquid markets, their prices are readily observable and are fully reflected in each quarter’s mark to market. Quarterly MSR hedging results include a combination of directional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any carry income generated. If the economic hedge is effective, its overall directional hedge gain or loss will offset the change in the valuation of the underlying MSR asset. Gains or losses associated with these economic hedges are included in mortgage banking noninterest income. Consistent with our longstanding approach to hedging interest rate risk in the mortgage business, the size of the hedge and the particular combination of forward hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of the mortgage business’s earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Because market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage business change continually, the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our MSRs portfolio. Throughout 2018, our economic hedging strategy generally used forward mortgage purchase contracts that were effective at offsetting the impact of interest rates on the value of the MSR asset.

Mortgage forward contracts are designed to pass the full economics of the underlying reference mortgage securities to the 

holder of the contract, including both the directional gain and loss from the forward delivery of the reference securities and the corresponding carry income. Carry income represents the contract’s price accretion from the forward delivery price to the spot price including both the yield earned on the reference securities and the market implied cost of financing during the period. The actual amount of carry income earned on the hedge each quarter will depend on the amount of the underlying asset that is hedged and the particular instruments included in the hedge. The level of carry income is driven by the slope of the yield curve and other market driven supply and demand factors affecting the specific reference securities. A steep yield curve generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry income. The level of carry income is also affected by the type of instrument used. In general, mortgage forward contracts tend to produce higher carry income than interest rate swap contracts. Carry income is recognized over the life of the mortgage forward as a component of the contract’s mark to market gain or loss.

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. While we attempt to balance these various aspects of the mortgage business, there are several potential risks to earnings:

•Valuation changes for MSRs associated with interest rate changes are recorded in earnings immediately within the accounting period in which those interest rate changes occur, whereas the impact of those same changes in interest rates on origination and servicing fees occur with a lag and over time. Thus, the mortgage business could be protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time on a cumulative basis but still display large variations in income from one accounting period to the next.

•The degree to which our net gains on loan originations offsets valuation changes for MSRs is imperfect, varies at different points in the interest rate cycle, and depends not just on the direction of interest rates but on the pattern of quarterly interest rate changes.

•Origination volumes, the valuation of MSRs and hedging results and associated costs are also affected by many factors. Such factors include the mix of new business between ARMs and fixed-rate mortgages, the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates, the degree of volatility in interest rates, the relationship between mortgage interest rates and other interest rate markets, and other interest rate factors. Additional factors that can impact the valuation of the MSRs include changes in servicing and foreclosure costs due to changes in investor or regulatory guidelines, as well as individual state foreclosure legislation, and changes in discount rates due to market participants requiring a higher return due to updated market expectations on costs and risks associated with investing in MSRs. Many of these factors are hard to predict and we may not be able to directly or perfectly hedge their effect.

•While our hedging activities are designed to balance our mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged. For example, the change in the value of ARM production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates may or may not be fully offset by index-based financial instruments used as economic hedges for such ARMs. Additionally, hedge-carry income on our economic hedges for the MSRs may not continue at recent levels if the spread between short-term and long-term 

 Wells Fargo & Company97

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued)

interest rates decreases, the overall level of hedges changes as interest rates change, or there are other changes in the market for mortgage forwards that affect the implied carry.

The total carrying value of our residential and commercial MSRs was $16.1 billion and $15.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The weighted-average note rate on our portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.32% and 4.23% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The carrying value of our total MSRs represented 0.94% and 0.88% of mortgage loans serviced for others at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

As part of our mortgage banking activities, we enter into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future. A mortgage loan commitment can be either a floating rate commitment, where the interest rate is not yet determined, or it can be an interest rate lock that binds us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, generally up to 60 days after inception of the rate lock. These loan commitments are derivative loan commitments if the loans that will result from the exercise of the commitments will be held for sale. These derivative loan commitments are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in their fair values recorded as part of mortgage banking noninterest income. The fair value of these commitments include, at inception and during the life of the loan commitment, the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan as part of the fair value measurement of derivative loan commitments. Changes subsequent to inception are based on changes in fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the exercise of the commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will not fund within the terms of the commitment, referred to as a fall-out factor. The value of the underlying loan commitment is affected by changes in interest rates and the passage of time.

Outstanding derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) expose us to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments might decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan. To minimize this risk, we employ mortgage forwards and options and Eurodollar futures and options contracts as economic hedges against the potential decreases in the values of the loans. We expect that these derivative financial instruments will experience changes in fair value that will either fully or partially offset the changes in fair value of the derivative loan commitments. However, changes in investor demand, such as concerns about credit risk, can also cause changes in the spread relationships between underlying loan value and the derivative financial instruments that cannot be hedged.

MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty risk. This includes implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. Market risk also includes counterparty credit risk, price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the associated hedge effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and impairment on private equity investments.

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk matters to the Risk Committee.

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk Management function, which is part of Corporate Risk, has primary oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO and also provides periodic reporting related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee. In addition, the Risk & Control Committee for each business group and enterprise function reports market risk matters to the Enterprise Risk & Control Committee.

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities predominantly occur within our Wholesale Banking businesses and to a lesser extent other divisions of the Company. Debt securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our income statement. Changes in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are reflected in net gains on trading activities, a component of noninterest income in our income statement. For more information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 4 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management function aggregates and monitors all exposures to ensure risk measures are within our established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and legal entity.

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 

Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our balance sheet.

98Wells Fargo & Company 

Table 38 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk category. As presented in Table 38, average Company Trading General VaR was $16 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared with $12 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, and $13 million for the quarter ended 

December 31, 2017. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, was mainly driven by changes in portfolio composition.

Table 38: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days.

Sensitivity Analysis Given the inherent limitations of the VaR models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves.

Stress Testing While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative approach since experience demonstrates otherwise).

An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis addresses how these events might affect the risk factors relevant to a portfolio.

The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated to address potential market events or concerns. For 

more detail on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in this Report.

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. These private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved by management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review business developments, key risks and historical returns for the private equity investment portfolio at least annually. Management reviews these investments at least quarterly and assesses them for possible OTTI. For nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment’s cash flows and capital needs, the viability of its business model and our exit strategy. Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and the measurement alternative.

In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering (IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our balance sheet. For additional information about the associated litigation matters, see the “Interchange Litigation” section in Note 16 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 Wells Fargo & Company99

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued)

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For more information, see Note 8 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and other business activities. Each business line monitors and manages these indirect risks.

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING  The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board of Directors establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the consolidated company and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries.

Liquidity Standards In September 2014, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued a final rule that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires banking institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), such as central bank reserves and government and corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. The rule is applicable to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion. In addition, the FRB finalized rules imposing enhanced liquidity management standards on large bank holding companies (BHC) such as Wells Fargo, and has finalized a rule that requires large bank holding companies to publicly disclose on a quarterly basis certain quantitative and qualitative information regarding their LCR calculations. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have proposed a rule that would implement a stable funding requirement, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which would require large banking organizations, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a sufficient amount of stable funding in relation to their assets, derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio As of December 31, 2018, the consolidated Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. were above the minimum LCR requirement of 100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 39 presents the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule requirements. 

Table 39:  Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes excess HQLA at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

(2) Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule.

Liquidity Sources We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity which are presented in Table 40. Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary insured depository institutions required under the LCR rule. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies within our debt securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt securities are within the held-to-maturity portion of our debt securities portfolio and as such are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing. Some of the legal entities within our consolidated group of companies are subject to various regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that can limit the transferability of their funds. We believe we maintain adequate liquidity for these entities in consideration of such funds transfer restrictions.

Table 40: Primary Sources of Liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in Table 40, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of other debt securities including trading and/or available-for-sale debt securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not encumbered. In addition, other debt securities in our held-to-maturity portfolio, to the extent not encumbered, may be pledged to obtain financing.

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 135% of total loans at December 31, 2018, and 140% at December 31, 2017. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. We access domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) through issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and asset-backed secured funding. 

Table 41 shows selected information for short-term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days.

Parent In February 2017, the Parent filed a registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, preferred stock and other securities. The Parent’s ability to issue debt and other securities under this registration statement is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by the Board. As of December 31, 2018, the Parent was authorized by the Board to issue up to $180 billion in outstanding long-term debt. The Parent’s long-term debt issuance authority granted by the Board includes debt issued to affiliates and others. At December 31, 2018, the Parent had available $38.1 billion in long-term debt issuance authority. In 2018, the Parent issued $2.0 billion of senior notes, of which $1.5 billion were registered with the SEC. In addition, the Parent issued $5.5 billion of registered senior notes in January 2019 and issued CAD $1.0 billion of senior notes in February 2019 that were registered in the U.S. and distributed on a private placement basis in Canada. The Parent’s short-term debt issuance authority granted by the Board was limited to debt issued to affiliates, and was revoked by the Board at management’s request in January 2018. 

The Parent’s proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in 

the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or otherwise.

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2018, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was authorized by its board of directors to issue $100 billion in outstanding short-term debt and $175 billion in outstanding long-term debt and had available $99.1 billion in short-term debt issuance authority and $96.4 billion in long-term debt issuance authority. In April 2018, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. established a new $100 billion bank note program under which, subject to any other debt outstanding under the limits described above, it may issue $50 billion in outstanding short-term senior notes and $50 billion in outstanding long-term senior or subordinated notes. At December 31, 2018, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had remaining issuance capacity under the new bank note program of $50.0 billion in short-term senior notes and $39.8 billion in long-term senior or subordinated notes. In 2018, Wells Fargo

Bank, N.A. issued $17.8 billion of unregistered senior notes, including $1.0 billion of senior redeemable floating rate notes issued in September 2018 with an interest rate indexed to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and $6.0 billion of which were issued under a prior bank note program. SOFR is an alternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates will occur by the end of 2021. Accordingly, the FASB recently issued a pronouncement that includes SOFR, among others, as a permitted benchmark interest rate for the application of hedge accounting. We have a significant amount of assets and liabilities referenced to LIBOR such as commercial loans, adjustable rate mortgage loans, derivatives, securities, and long-term debt. We have established a LIBOR Transition Office to develop and direct a coordinated strategy to transition numerous products and exposures away from LIBOR. The LIBOR Transition Office has initiated a comprehensive, company-wide process to address certain challenges and risks associated with the transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR and has directed an evaluation of the provisions in our contracts that could apply in connection with any discontinuation of, or change to, LIBOR, as well as the operational issues that could arise. In addition, regulators and trade associations periodically issue guidance, consultations and recommendations relating to LIBOR-transition matters, which will inform our overall planning. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional information regarding the potential impact of a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or other referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced or discontinued.

In addition, during 2018, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. executed advances of $29.2 billion with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, and as of December 31, 2018, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had outstanding advances of $49.6 billion across the Federal Home Loan Bank System. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. executed $3.0 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances in February 2019.

Credit Ratings Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well as other market participants, generally will consider, among other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants.

There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies with regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2018. Both the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. remain among the highest-rated financial firms in the U.S.

See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations, as well as Note 17 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2018, are presented in Table 42.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP The Federal Home Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending institutions use to finance housing and economic development in local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. Each member of the FHLBs is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can increase the minimum investment 

requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future payments to the FHLBs are not determinable.

Capital Management

We have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily fund our working capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 

repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long and short-term debt. Retained earnings increased $12.9 billion from December 31, 2017, predominantly from Wells Fargo net income of $22.4 billion, less common and preferred stock dividends of $9.5 billion. During 2018, we issued 65.1 million shares of common stock. During 2018, we repurchased 375.5 million shares of common stock in open 

102Wells Fargo & Company 

market transactions, including through forward repurchase transactions, and from employee benefit plans, at a cost of $20.6 billion. The amount of our repurchases are subject to various factors as discussed in the “Securities Repurchases” section below. For additional information about our forward repurchase agreements, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

On September 17, 2018, we redeemed all of our 8.00% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series J, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per share.

Regulatory Capital Guidelines

The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company is subject to final and interim final rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These rules are based on international guidelines for determining regulatory capital issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, among other things, require on a fully phased-in basis:

•a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.0%, comprised of a 4.5% minimum requirement plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and for us, as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge to be calculated annually, which is 2.0% based on our year-end 2017 data;

•a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%, comprised of a 6.0% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.0%;

•a minimum total capital ratio of 12.5%, comprised of a 8.0% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.0%;

•a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% to be added to the minimum capital ratios, which is currently not in effect but could be imposed by regulators at their discretion if it is determined that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk;

•a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%; and 

•a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 5.0% (comprised of a 3.0% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%) for large and internationally active bank holding companies (BHCs).

We were required to comply with the final Basel III capital rules beginning January 2014, with certain provisions subject to phase-in periods. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. However, the requirements for calculating tier 2 and total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements. The entire Basel III capital rules are scheduled to be fully phased in by the end of 2021. The Basel III capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo. Accordingly, in the assessment of our capital adequacy, we must report the lower of our CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios calculated 

under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach. 

On April 10, 2018, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would add a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer to the minimum capital and tier 1 leverage ratio requirements. The buffers would be calculated based on the decrease in a financial institution’s risk-based capital and tier 1 leverage ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario in CCAR, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The stress capital buffer would replace the 2.5% capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Approach, whereas the stress leverage buffer would be added to the current 4% minimum tier 1 leverage ratio.

Because the Company has been designated as a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule implementing the additional capital surcharge of between 1.0-4.5% on G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second (method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than the BCBS methodology. The G-SIB surcharge became fully effective on January 1, 2019. Based on year-end 2017 data, our 2019 G-SIB surcharge under method two is 2.0% of the Company’s RWAs, which is the higher of method one and method two. Because the G-SIB surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. Under the Standardized Approach (fully phased-in), our CET1 ratio of 11.74% exceeded the minimum of 9.0% by 274 basis points at December 31, 2018.

The tables that follow provide information about our risk- based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital guidelines. For banking industry regulatory reporting purposes, we continue to report our tier 2 and total capital in accordance with Transition Requirements but are managing our capital based on a fully phased-in calculation. For information about our capital requirements calculated in accordance with Transition Requirements, see Note 28 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Table 43 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, risk-weighted assets and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, our CET1, tier 1, and total capital ratios were lower using RWAs calculated under the Standardized Approach.

(1)Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. However, the requirements for calculating tier 2 and total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements. Accordingly, fully phased-in total capital amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s capital position. See Table 44 for information regarding the calculation and components of CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital and RWAs, as well as the corresponding reconciliation of our fully phased-in regulatory capital amounts to GAAP financial measures.

(2)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

(3)Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in, so the effect of the transition requirements was $0 at December 31, 2018.

(4)Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.6% of Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted from total RWAs.

(5)RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of operating loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems. 

(6)Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities, but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible common equity ratios are as follows:

•Tangible book value per common share, which represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.

•Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings contribution as a percentage of tangible common equity.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible book value per common share and return on average tangible common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company’s use of equity.

Table 47 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

Capital Management (continued)

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO In April 2014, federal banking regulators finalized a rule that enhances the SLR requirements for BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions. The SLR consists of Tier 1 capital divided by the Company’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of the total average on-balance sheet assets, plus off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivative exposures, less amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital. The rule, which became effective on January 1, 2018, requires a covered BHC to maintain a SLR of at least 5.0% (comprised of the 3.0% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The rule also requires that all of our insured depository institutions maintain a SLR of 6.0% under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. In April 2018, the FRB and OCC proposed rules (the “Proposed SLR Rules”) that would replace the 2% supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of the firm’s G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR Rules would similarly tailor the current 6% SLR requirement for our insured depository institutions. At December 31, 2018, our SLR for the Company was 7.7% calculated under the Advanced Approach capital framework. Based on our review, our current leverage levels would exceed the applicable requirements for each of our insured depository institutions as well. See Table 48 for information regarding the calculation and components of the SLR.

(1)Amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. 

(2)Represents adjustments for off balance sheet derivative exposures, and derivative collateral netting as defined for supplementary leverage ratio determination purposes.

(3)Adjustments for repo-style transactions represent counterparty credit risk for all repo-style transactions where Wells Fargo & Company is the principal (i.e., principal counterparty facing the client).

(4)Adjustments for other off-balance sheet exposures represent the notional amounts of all off-balance sheet exposures (excluding off balance sheet exposures associated with derivative and repo-style transactions) less the adjustments for conversion to credit equivalent amounts under the regulatory capital rule.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL MATTERS In December 2016, the FRB finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under the rules, which became effective on January 1, 2019, U.S. G-SIBs are required to have a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1 capital and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) equal to the greater of (i) 18% of RWAs and (ii) 7.5% of total leverage exposure (the 

denominator of the SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs are required to maintain (i) a TLAC buffer equal to 2.5% of RWAs plus the firm’s applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method one plus any applicable countercyclical buffer to be added to the 18% minimum and (ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer equal to 2.0% of total leverage exposure to be added to the 7.5% minimum, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The rules also require U.S. G-SIBs to have a minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 6.0% of RWAs plus the firm’s applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method two and (ii) 4.5% of the total leverage exposure. In addition, the rules impose certain restrictions on the operations and liabilities of the top-tier or covered BHC in order to further facilitate an orderly resolution, including prohibitions on the issuance of short-term debt to external investors and on entering into derivatives and certain other types of financial contracts with external counterparties. While the rules permit permanent grandfathering of a significant portion of otherwise ineligible long-term debt that was issued prior to December 31, 2016, long-term debt issued after that date must be fully compliant with the eligibility requirements of the rules in order to count toward the minimum TLAC amount. As a result of the rules, we will need to issue additional long-term debt to remain compliant with the requirements. Under the Proposed SLR Rules, the 2% external TLAC leverage buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to one-half of the firm’s G-SIB capital surcharge. Additionally, the Proposed SLR Rules would modify the leverage component for calculating the minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt from 4.5% of total leverage exposure to 2.5% of total leverage exposure plus one-half of the firm’s G-SIB capital surcharge. As of December 31, 2018, our eligible external TLAC as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.35% compared with a required minimum of 22.0%. Similar to the risk-based capital requirements, we determine minimum required TLAC based on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced approaches.

In addition, as discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability Management – Liquidity and Funding – Liquidity Standards” section in this Report, federal banking regulators have issued a final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR and a proposed rule regarding the NSFR.

Capital Planning and Stress Testing

Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements including the G-SIB surcharge. Accordingly, based on the final Basel III capital rules under the lower of the Standardized or Advanced Approaches CET1 capital ratios, we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 10%, which includes a 2% G-SIB surcharge. Our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, including changes to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. As discussed above in “Regulatory Capital Guidelines”, the FRB has proposed including a stress capital buffer (SCB) to replace the current capital conservation buffer as part of the capital requirements for large U.S. banks. The proposal is not final, but 

108Wells Fargo & Company 

it is expected that the adoption of CECL accounting would be included in the SCB calculation. We expect that implementation of the SCB may increase the level and volatility of minimum capital requirements, which may cause our current 10% CET1 long-term target ratio to increase. 

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB has any objections before making any capital distributions. The rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs while considering both quantitative and qualitative factors when evaluating capital plans. 

Our 2018 capital plan, which was submitted on April 4, 2018, as part of CCAR, included a comprehensive capital outlook supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios. As part of the 2018 CCAR, the FRB also generated a supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the Company to estimate performance. The FRB reviewed the supervisory stress results both as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking into account the Company’s proposed capital actions. The FRB published its supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act on June 21, 2018. On June 28, 2018, the FRB notified us that it did not object to our capital plan included in the 2018 CCAR.

Federal banking regulators require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. These stress testing requirements set forth the timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and banks must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls, oversight and disclosure requirements. The rules also limit a large BHC’s ability to make capital distributions to the extent its actual capital issuances were less than amounts indicated in its capital plan. As required under the FRB’s stress testing rule, we must submit a mid-cycle stress test based on second quarter data and scenarios developed by the Company. We submitted the results of the mid-cycle stress test to the FRB and disclosed a summary of the results in October 2018. In October 2018, the FRB proposed a rule that would, among other things, eliminate the mid-cycle stress test requirement for banks beginning in 2020.

Securities Repurchases

From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward repurchase transactions, and similar transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the FRB’s response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk profile. Due to the various factors impacting the amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan, our repurchases occur at various price levels. We may suspend repurchase activity at any time. 

In January 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of 350 million shares of our common stock. In October 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 350 million shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2018, we had remaining authority to repurchase approximately 395 million shares, subject to regulatory and legal conditions. For more information about share repurchases during fourth quarter 2018, see Part II, Item 5 in our 2018 Form 10-K.

Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under the “safe harbor” conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all of the consideration. Our management may determine that during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, including the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition.

In connection with our participation in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), we issued to the U.S. Treasury Department warrants to purchase 110,261,688 shares of our common stock with an original exercise price of $34.01 per share. The warrants expired on October 29, 2018, and the holders of 110,646 unexercised warrants as of the expiration date are no longer entitled to receive any shares of our common stock.

Regulatory Matters (continued)

Regulatory Matters

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. financial services industry has been subject to a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has increased their regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For additional information about the regulatory matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2018 Form 10-K, and the “Capital Management,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 28 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s and is driving much of the current U.S. regulatory reform efforts. The Dodd-Frank Act and many of its provisions became effective in July 2010 and July 2011. The following provides additional information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including the current status of certain of its rulemaking initiatives.

•Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms. The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. The FRB has also finalized enhanced prudential standards that implement single counterparty credit limits, and has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Similarly, the FRB has proposed additional requirements regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, including its expectations for boards of directors and senior management. In addition to the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. The OCC, under separate authority, has also finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. 

•Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection 

Bureau (CFPB) to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect them from hidden fees and unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. With respect to residential mortgage lending, the CFPB issued a number of final rules implementing new origination, notification, disclosure and other requirements, as well as additional limitations on the fees and charges that may be increased from the estimates provided by lenders. The CFPB finalized amendments to the rule implementing the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, resulting in a significant expansion of the data points lenders are required to collect and report to the CFPB. The CFPB also expanded the transactions covered by the rule and increased the reporting frequency from annual to quarterly for large volume lenders, such as Wells Fargo, beginning January 1, 2020. With respect to other financial products, the CFPB finalized rules, most of which become effective on April 1, 2019, to make prepaid cards subject to similar consumer protections as those provided by more traditional debit and credit cards such as fraud protection and expanded access to account information. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its on-going supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, student lending activities, and automobile finance.

•Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, with limited exceptions, prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning any interest in or sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund, a private equity fund or certain structured transactions that are deemed covered funds. Federal banking regulators, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) (collectively, the Volcker supervisory regulators) jointly released a final rule to implement the Volcker Rule’s restrictions, and the FRB has proposed further rules to streamline and modify compliance with the Volcker Rule’s requirements. As a banking entity with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets, we are also subject to enhanced compliance program requirements. 

•Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives and authorized the CFTC and the SEC to regulate swaps and security-based swaps, respectively. The CFTC has adopted rules applicable to our provisionally registered swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that require, among other things, extensive regulatory and public reporting of swaps, central clearing and trading of swaps on exchanges or other multilateral platforms, and compliance with comprehensive internal and external business conduct standards. The SEC is expected to implement parallel rules applicable to security-based swaps. In addition, federal regulators have adopted final rules establishing initial and variation margin requirements for swaps and security-based swaps not centrally cleared, rules placing restrictions on a party’s right to exercise default rights under derivatives and other qualified financial contracts against applicable banking organizations, and record-keeping requirements for qualified financial contracts. All of these new rules, as well as others being considered by regulators in other jurisdictions, may

negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities.

•Regulation of interchange transaction fees (the Durbin Amendment). On October 1, 2011, the FRB rule enacted to implement the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that limits debit card interchange transaction fees to those reasonable and proportional to the cost of the transaction became effective. The rule generally established that the maximum allowable interchange fee that an issuer may receive or charge for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the approach used by the FRB in setting the maximum allowable interchange transaction fee impermissibly included costs that were specifically excluded from consideration under the Durbin Amendment. In August 2013, the FRB filed a notice of appeal of the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In March 2014, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision, but did direct the FRB to provide further explanation regarding its treatment of the costs of monitoring transactions, which the FRB published in August 2015. The plaintiffs did not file a petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeals but filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. In January 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari. 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines and Capital Plans 

During 2013, federal banking regulators issued final rules that substantially amended the risk-based capital rules for banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in the U.S., comply with changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and replace the existing Basel I-based capital requirements. We were required to begin complying with the rules on January 1, 2014, subject to phase-in periods that are scheduled to be fully phased in by January 1, 2022. In 2014, federal banking regulators also finalized rules to impose a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions and to implement the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio. For more information on the final capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable to us, see the “Capital Management” section in this Report.

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters

Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically revise resolution plans, so-called “living-wills”, that would facilitate their resolution in the event of material distress or failure. Under the rules, resolution plans are required to provide strategies for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency regimes that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that mitigates the risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. On December 19, 2017, the FRB and FDIC announced that Wells Fargo’s 2017 resolution plan submission did not have any deficiencies; however, they identified a specific shortcoming that would need to be addressed in the Company’s next submission. Our national bank subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the 

“Bank”), is also required to prepare a resolution plan and submitted its 2018 resolution plan to the FDIC on June 29, 2018. If the FRB or FDIC determines that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB or FDIC ultimately determines that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. 

We must also prepare and submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determine that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances. 

Whether under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority, Wells Fargo could be resolved using a “multiple point of entry” strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution proceedings, or a “single point of entry” strategy, in which the Parent would likely be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. The FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan submission is a multiple point of entry strategy; however, we have made a decision to move to a single point of entry strategy for our next resolution plan submission. We are not obligated to maintain either a single point of entry or multiple point of entry strategy, and the strategies reflected in our resolution plan submissions are not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority.

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, 

 Wells Fargo & Company111

Regulatory Matters (continued)

federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries in order to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company using either a single point of entry or multiple point of entry resolution strategy, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement (the “Support Agreement”) with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), and the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), each an indirect subsidiary of the Parent. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank pursuant to the Support Agreement and to WFS and WFCS through repurchase facilities entered into in connection with the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, the subordinated notes would be forgiven and the committed line of credit would terminate, which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. The Parent’s and the IHC’s respective obligations under the Support Agreement are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.

Other Regulatory Related Matters

•Broker-dealer standards of conduct. In April 2018, the SEC proposed a rule that would require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. This rule may impact the manner in which business is conducted with customers seeking investment advice and may affect certain investment product offerings.

•OCC revocation of relief. On November 18, 2016, the OCC revoked provisions of certain consent orders that provided Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. relief from specific requirements and limitations regarding rules, policies, and procedures for corporate activities; OCC approval of changes in directors and senior executive officers; and golden parachute payments. As a result, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is no longer eligible for expedited treatment for certain applications; is 

now required to provide prior written notice to the OCC of a change in directors and senior executive officers; and is now subject to certain regulatory limitations on golden parachute payments.

•Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating. In March 2017, we announced that the OCC had downgraded our most recent CRA rating, which covers the years 2009 – 2012, to “Needs to Improve” due to previously issued regulatory consent orders. A “Needs to Improve” rating imposes regulatory restrictions and limitations on certain of the Company’s nonbank activities, including its ability to engage in certain nonbank mergers and acquisitions or undertake new financial in nature activities, and CRA performance is taken into account by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches and for approving proposed bank mergers and acquisitions. The rating also results in the loss of expedited processing of applications to undertake certain activities, and requires the Company to receive prior regulatory approval for certain activities, including to issue or prepay certain subordinated debt obligations, open or relocate bank branches, or make certain public welfare investments. In addition, a “Needs to Improve” rating could have an impact on the Company’s relationships with certain states, counties, municipalities or other public agencies to the extent applicable law, regulation or policy limits, restricts or influences whether such entity may do business with a company that has a below “Satisfactory” rating.

•FRB consent order regarding governance oversight and compliance and operational risk management. On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the FRB. As required by the consent order, the Board submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The consent order requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete third-party reviews of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until these third-party reviews are complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap will be measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. The Company continues to have constructive dialogue with the FRB on an ongoing basis to clarify expectations, receive feedback, and assess progress under the consent order. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback into the Company’s plans in a thoughtful manner, adopt and implement the final plans as accepted by the FRB, and complete the required third-party reviews, the Company is planning to operate under the asset cap through the end of 2019. Additionally, after removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

•Consent orders with the CFPB and OCC regarding compliance risk management program, automobile collateral protection insurance policies, and mortgage interest rate lock extensions. On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the CFPB and OCC to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money 

112Wells Fargo & Company 

penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer 

financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern:

•the allowance for credit losses;

•the valuation of residential MSRs;

•the fair value of financial instruments; 

•income taxes; and

•liability for contingent litigation losses.

Management and the Board’s Audit and Examination Committee have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.

Allowance for Credit Losses

We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, which is management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried at fair value. For a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers changes in economic conditions, customer behavior, and collateral value, among other influences. From time to time, economic factors or business decisions, such as the addition or liquidation of a loan product or business unit, may affect the loan portfolio, causing management to provide for or release amounts from the allowance for credit losses. While our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. 

Judgment is specifically applied in:

•Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans and unfunded credit commitments. We estimate the probability of default in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength using a borrower quality rating and the severity of loss in the event of default using a collateral quality rating. Collectively, these ratings are referred to as credit risk ratings and are assigned to our commercial loans. 

Probability of default and severity at the time of default are statistically derived through historical observations of defaults and losses after default within each credit risk rating. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an internal team of credit specialists.

•Economic assumptions applied to pools of consumer loans (statistically modeled). Losses are estimated using economic variables to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. Our forecasted losses are modeled using a range of economic scenarios. 

•Selection of a credit loss estimation model that fits the credit risk characteristics of its portfolio. We use both internally developed and vendor supplied models in this process. We often use expected loss, transition rate, flow rate, competing hazard, vintage maturation, and time series or statistical trend models, most with economic correlations. Management must use judgment in establishing additional input metrics for the modeling processes, considering further stratification into reference data time series, sub-product, origination channel, vintage, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. The models used to determine the allowance for credit losses are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. 

•Assessment of limitations to credit loss estimation models. We apply our judgment to adjust our modeled estimates to reflect other risks that may be identified from current conditions and developments in selected portfolios.

•Identification and measurement of impaired loans, including loans modified in a TDR. Our experienced senior credit officers may consider a loan impaired based on their evaluation of current information and events, including loans modified in a TDR. The measurement of impairment is typically based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows. The development of these expectations requires significant management judgment and review. 

•An amount for imprecision or uncertainty which reflects management’s overall estimate of the effect of quantitative and qualitative factors on inherent credit losses. This amount represents management’s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. This imprecision considers economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.

SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES Table 49 demonstrates the impact of the sensitivity of our estimates on our allowance for credit losses.

Table 49: Allowance Sensitivity Summary 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Represents a one risk rating upgrade throughout our commercial portfolio segment and a more optimistic economic outlook for modeled losses on our consumer portfolio segment.

(2)Represents a one risk rating downgrade throughout our commercial portfolio segment, a more pessimistic economic outlook for modeled losses on our consumer portfolio segment, and incremental deterioration for PCI loans.

The sensitivity analyses provided in the previous table are hypothetical scenarios and are not considered probable. They do not represent management’s view of inherent losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Because significant judgment is used, it is possible that others performing similar analyses could reach different conclusions. See the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of our allowance for credit losses. 

Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)

MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we purchase servicing rights from third parties, or retain servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers). We also have MSRs acquired in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents.

We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are reflected in earnings.

We use a model to estimate the fair value of our residential MSRs. The model is validated by an internal model validation group operating in accordance with Company policies. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and require judgment to determine. If observable market indications do become available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: 

•The mortgage loan prepayment speed used to estimate future net servicing income. The prepayment speed is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment speeds and borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior.

•The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties from servicing 

operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts).

•The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net servicing income. The cost to service loans includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of defaulted loans as well as changes in servicing processes associated with default and foreclosure management.

Both prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions can, and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, while our current valuation reflects our best estimate of servicing costs, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or additional market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods.

For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 9 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 10 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 18 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. For example, assets and liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities not held for trading purposes, debt securities available for sale, derivatives and substantially all of our residential MLHFS are carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, such as certain MLHFS, nonmarketable equity securities and substantially all of our loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments due to application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting, measurement alternative accounting or write-downs of individual assets. We also disclose our estimate of fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as loans held for investment or issuances of long-term debt.

The accounting provisions for fair value measurements include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. For additional information on fair value levels, see Note 18 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in 

114Wells Fargo & Company 

active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internally-developed models based on unobservable inputs. In these instances, management judgment is necessary as we are required to make judgments about significant assumptions market participants would use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or other observable market data, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate of fair value based primarily on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. For additional information on our use of pricing services, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 18 (Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Significant judgment is also required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 18 (Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. When making this judgment, we consider available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. The classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.

Table 50 presents the summary of the fair value of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the amounts of Level 3 assets and liabilities (before derivative netting adjustments). The fair value of the remaining assets and liabilities were measured using valuation methodologies involving market-based or market-derived information (collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements).

Income Taxes

We file consolidated and separate company U.S. federal income tax returns, foreign tax returns and various combined and separate company state tax returns. We evaluate two components of income tax expense: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. We determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is “more likely than not.” Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. We account for interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. In 2018, we finalized the recognition of the U.S. tax expense associated with a deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries as required under the 2017 Tax Act. We do not intend to distribute these earnings in a taxable manner, and therefore intend to limit distributions of foreign earnings previously taxed in the U.S., that would qualify for the 100% dividends received deduction, and that would not result in any significant state or foreign taxes. All other undistributed foreign earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these disputes during the 

 Wells Fargo & Company115

Critical Accounting Policies (continued)

tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the court systems when applicable.

We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any given quarter.

See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities.

Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses

The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, arbitration and other proceedings concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities, and many of those proceedings expose the Company to potential financial loss. We establish accruals for these legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions.

We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding of information currently available related to the legal evaluation and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management. These matters may be in various stages of investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was not considered or was considered remote in anticipated occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss.

Current Accounting Developments

Table 51 provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective.

Table 51: Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards

Standard Description Effective date and financial statement impact

Accounting Standard Update (ASU or Update) 2018-16 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes The Update expands the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates permitted in the application of hedge accounting. The Update adds the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate to facilitate the LIBOR to SOFR transition and provide sufficient lead time for entities to prepare for changes to interest rate risk hedging strategies for both risk management and hedge accounting purposes. We adopted the guidance in first quarter 2019. The adoption did not impact existing hedges, but may impact new hedge relationships if we designate the SOFR OIS rate as the designated hedged benchmark interest rate for the Company’s fixed-rate financial instruments and forecasted issuances or purchases of fixed-rate financial instruments.

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts The Update requires all features in long-duration insurance contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. Currently, two measurement models exist for these features, fair value and insurance accrual. The Update requires the use of a standardized discount rate and routine updates for insurance assumptions used in valuing the liability for future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts. The Update also simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.

 The guidance becomes effective on January 1, 2021. Certain of our variable annuity reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair value as of the earliest period presented. The cumulative effect of changes attributable to the market risk benefit of the liability’s instrument-specific credit risk (i.e., the Company’s own credit risk) will be recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and carrying value, excluding the effect of our own credit, will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings. Changes to the liability for future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding contracts on the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The impact of the Update on our consolidated financial statements is still being evaluated.

ASU 2017-08 – Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities The Update changes the accounting for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium to shorten the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date rather than to the maturity date. Accounting for purchased callable debt securities held at a discount does not change. The discount would continue to amortize to the maturity date. 

We adopted the guidance in first quarter 2019 and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2019, that reduced retained earnings by $592 million and increased other comprehensive income by $481 million. The guidance impacted our investments in purchased callable debt securities held at a premium classified as available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM), which primarily consist of obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions. In future periods, interest income recognized prior to the call date will be reduced because the premium will be amortized over a shorter time period.

For loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, the Update requires a current expected credit loss (CECL) measurement to estimate the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Update eliminates the existing guidance for PCI loans, but requires an allowance for purchased financial assets with more than insignificant deterioration since origination. In addition, the Update modifies the other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities to require an allowance for credit impairment instead of a direct write-down, which allows for reversal of credit impairments in future periods based on improvements in credit. 

We expect to adopt the guidance in first quarter 2020. Our implementation process includes loss forecasting model development, evaluation of technical accounting topics, updates to our allowance documentation, reporting processes and related internal controls, and overall operational readiness for our adoption of the Update, which will continue throughout 2019, including parallel runs for CECL alongside our current allowance process.

We are in the process of developing, validating, and implementing models used to estimate credit losses under CECL. We have substantially completed a significant majority of our loss forecasting models, and we expect to complete the validation process for our loan models during 2019.

Our current planned approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses for loans and debt securities includes the following key components: 

•An initial forecast period of one year for all portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects management’s expectation of losses based on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time.

•A historical loss forecast period covering the remaining contractual life, adjusted for prepayments, by portfolio segment and class of financing receivables based on the change in key historic economic variables during representative historical expansionary and recessionary periods.

•A reversion period of up to 2 years connecting the initial loss forecast to the historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date. 

•We will utilize discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to measure credit impairment for loans modified in a TDR, unless they are collateral dependent and measured at the fair value of collateral. The DCF methods would obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the conceptual components described above.

•For available-for-sale debt securities and certain beneficial interests classified as held-to-maturity, we plan to utilize the DCF methods to measure the ACL, which will incorporate expected credit losses using the conceptual components described above. 

We expect an overall increase in the ACL for loans, with an expected increase for longer duration consumer portfolios and an expected decrease for commercial loans given short contractual maturities with conditional renewal options. The expected impact on our ACL does not include the impact of the FASB’s recently proposed change to consider recoveries of previously charged off loans or subsequent increases in fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans in the ACL measurement. If finalized, the proposed changes would reduce the expected change in our ACL. We continue to evaluate the results of our modeled loss estimates and will continue to make refinements to our approach, including evaluating an amount for imprecision or uncertainty, based on management’s judgment of the risk inherent in the processes and assumptions used in estimating the ACL.

We will recognize an ACL for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities. The ACL on available-for-sale debt securities will be subject to a limitation based on the fair value of the security. Based on the credit quality of our existing debt securities portfolio, we do not expect the ACL for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities to be significant. 

The amount of the change in our ACL will be impacted by our portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. At adoption, we expect to have a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for our change in the ACL, which will impact our capital. Federal banking regulatory agencies have agreed to limit the initial capital impact of the Update by allowing a phased adoption over three years, on a straight-line basis. An increase in our ACL will result in a reduction to our regulatory capital amounts and ratios; however, at this point in implementation, we are not able to provide a more precise estimate of the impact.

ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842) and subsequent related Updates The Update requires lessees to recognize operating leases on the balance sheet with lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets based on the present value of future lease payments. Lessor accounting activities are largely unchanged from existing lease accounting. The Update also eliminates leveraged lease accounting but allows existing leveraged leases to continue their current accounting until maturity, termination or modification. We adopted the guidance in first quarter 2019 and have elected not to provide a comparative presentation for 2018 and 2017 financial statements. At adoption, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $100 million that increased retained earnings related to deferred gains on our prior sale-leaseback transactions. Our operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, for approximately 7,000 leases, were $5 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. There were no material changes to the timing of expense recognition on these operating leases or in the recognition and measurement of our lessor accounting. While the increase to our consolidated total assets related to operating lease right-of-use assets increases our risk-weighted assets and decreases our capital ratios, we do not expect these changes to be material.

In addition to the list above, the following Updates are applicable to us but are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 

changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:

•current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth; 

•our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;

•financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;

•developments in our mortgage banking business, including the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive, any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking business and any changes in industry standards;

•our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating

environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters;

•the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale;

•significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios;

•the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses;

•negative effects from the retail banking sales practices matter and from other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified team members, and our reputation;

•resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;

•a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;

•the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;

•fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; and

•the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in this Report.

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations (including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.

For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this Report, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results.

Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company.

RISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES AND LIQUIDITY

As one of the largest lenders in the U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S. and internationally, our financial results have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, and a deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition.  We generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services we 

sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and commercial lending and banking businesses, including our mortgage banking business. These businesses have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. Although the U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve from the depressed levels of 2008 and early 2009, economic growth has at times been slow and uneven. In addition, the negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S. fiscal and political matters, including concerns about deficit levels, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the global economic recovery. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, restrictions on international trade, and global economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial markets and the global economy. In particular, Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union, including the terms of its exit, could increase economic barriers between 

120Wells Fargo & Company 

Britain and the European Union, limit our ability to conduct business in the European Union, impose additional costs on us, subject us to different laws, regulations and/or regulatory authorities, or adversely impact our business, financial results and operating model. For example, certain operations of our broker-dealer in London may be impacted by the terms and conditions of Britain’s withdrawal. Although we are transitioning certain of these operations to other European countries, there is no guarantee that we will be able to operate or conduct business in the European Union in the same manner following Britain’s withdrawal. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global economy, particularly in the U.S., or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or dampen the global economic recovery, could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. 

A weakening in business or economic conditions, including higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, can also adversely affect our borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, which can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings.

A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our investment advisory, mutual fund, securities brokerage, wealth management, and investment banking businesses. In 2018, approximately 25% of our revenue was fee income, which included trust and investment fees, card fees and other fees. We earn fee income from managing assets for others and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services. Because investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively affect the performance of products we have provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional costs. The U.S. stock market experienced all-time highs in 2018, but also experienced significant volatility and there is no guarantee that high price levels will continue or that price levels will stabilize. Poor economic conditions and volatile 

or unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our trading activities and venture capital businesses. Any deterioration in global financial markets and economies, including as a result of any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely affect the revenues and earnings of our international operations, particularly our global financial institution and correspondent banking services.

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” sections in this Report.

Changes in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, including as a result of recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans, debt securities and other assets we hold less

the interest we pay on our deposits, long-term and short-term debt, and other liabilities. Net interest income is a measure of both our net interest margin – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding – and the amount of earning assets we hold. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract.

The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our net interest income and yield. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged low interest rate environment as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs.

Changes in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens, or even inverts, our net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets.

The interest we earn on our loans may be tied to U.S.-denominated interest rates such as the federal funds rate while the interest we pay on our debt may be based on international rates such as LIBOR. If the federal funds rate were to fall without a corresponding decrease in LIBOR, we might earn less on our loans without any offsetting decrease in our funding costs. This could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income. 

 Wells Fargo & Company121

Risk Factors (continued)

In addition, our floating rate funding, certain hedging transactions, and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating rate loans and derivatives in connection with customer accommodation activities, reference a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or other financial metric in order to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. In the event any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial metric (for example, if LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as contemplated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority), there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument and there may be significant work required to transition to using any new benchmark rate or other financial metric. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require different hedging strategies, require renegotiation of previously booked transactions, or affect our capital and liquidity planning and management. In addition, the transition to using any new benchmark rate or other financial metric may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations and pricing processes, and could result in significant operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, losses on financial instruments we hold, or other adverse consequences. Furthermore, the transition from a widely-used benchmark rate like LIBOR to any new benchmark rate could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment and could result in customers challenging the determination of their interest payments or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. Moreover, to the extent borrowers with loans referenced to LIBOR, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, experience higher interest payments as a result of the transition to a new benchmark rate, our customers’ ability to repay their loans may be adversely affected, which can negatively impact our credit performance.

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide.

We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions.

We hold debt and equity securities, including U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and federal agency MBS, securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, residential and commercial MBS, corporate debt securities, other asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities, including securities relating to our venture capital activities. Because of changing economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of any collateral 

underlying the securities, we may be required to recognize OTTI in future periods on the securities we hold. In particular, economic difficulties in the oil and gas industry resulting from volatile or prolonged low energy prices may further impact our energy sector investments and require us to recognize OTTI in these investments in future periods. Furthermore, the value of the debt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income. As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public debt and equity securities that are subject to market fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although high market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-related losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse effect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity levels. Although we have processes in place to measure and monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of factors, including general economic and market conditions, the prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions.

Nonmarketable equity securities include our private equity and venture capital investments that could result in significant OTTI losses for those investments carried under the measurement alternative or equity method. If we determine there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings, which could be significant.

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk”, “– Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk”, “– Market Risk – Trading Activities”, and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 4 (Trading Activities), Note 5 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 8 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Effective liquidity management, which ensures that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments, including principal and interest payments on our debt, efficiently under both normal operating conditions and 

122Wells Fargo & Company 

other unpredictable circumstances of industry or financial market stress, is essential for the operation of our business, and our financial results and condition could be materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity.  Our liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. We primarily rely on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and the operation of our business. Customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and other savings, and certain foreign deposits, have historically provided us with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international money through capital markets.

Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. While market conditions have improved since the financial crisis, there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility.

In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels and any associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition.

As noted above, we rely heavily on bank deposits for our funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing 

deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity.

If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intraday basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuance of common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or in order to raise additional capital. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and condition.  Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs.

Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. Although a one or two notch downgrade in our current credit ratings would not be expected to trigger a material increase in our collateral or funding obligations, a more severe credit rating downgrade of our long-term and short-term credit ratings could increase our collateral or funding obligations and the effect on our liquidity could be material. 

For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity and Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, see Note 17 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Factors (continued)

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law, as well as certain contractual arrangements, can limit those dividends. Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement (the “Support Agreement”) dated June 28, 2017 among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, each an indirect subsidiary of the Parent, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.

For more information, refer to the “Regulation and Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company Structure” sections in our 2018 Form 10-K and to Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and Note 28 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS

Enacted legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position. Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those related to our brokerage and mutual fund businesses, are subject to significant and extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where we conduct business. These regulations protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, investors, team members, and the banking and financial system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. Economic, market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, affect or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue in businesses or impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or have other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenues in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, economic and social developments in those jurisdictions, 

including sanctions or business restrictions, asset freezes or confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic developments, or financial or social instability. In addition, greater government oversight and scrutiny of financial services companies has increased our operational and compliance costs as we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions, could result in fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s, became law. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant requirements and restrictions impacting the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, could result in a loss of revenue, require us to change certain of our business practices, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our capital requirements and impose additional assessments and costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business operations and have other negative consequences.

Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, automobile, credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations. In particular, we may be negatively affected by the activities of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad rulemaking powers and supervisory authority over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB’s activities may increase our compliance costs and require changes in our business practices as a result of regulations and requirements which could limit or negatively affect the products and services that we offer our customers. For example, the CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting residential mortgage lending practices and prepaid cards. If we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities including the products and services we can provide, and/or harm to our reputation.

The Dodd-Frank Act’s proposed prohibitions or limitations on proprietary trading and private fund investment activities, known as the “Volcker Rule,” also may reduce our revenue. Final rules to implement the requirements of the Volcker Rule were issued in December 2013. The FRB has proposed further rules to streamline and modify compliance with the Volcker Rule’s requirements. Wells Fargo is also subject to enhanced compliance program requirements. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives and authorized the CFTC and SEC to regulate swaps and security-based swaps, respectively. The CFTC has adopted rules applicable to our provisionally registered swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that require, among other things, extensive regulatory and public reporting of swaps, central clearing and trading of swaps on exchanges or other multilateral platforms, and compliance with comprehensive internal and external business conduct standards. The SEC is expected to implement parallel rules applicable to security-based swaps. In addition, federal regulators have adopted final rules establishing 

124Wells Fargo & Company 

initial and variation margin requirements for swaps and security-based swaps not centrally cleared, rules placing restrictions on a party’s right to exercise default rights under derivatives and other qualified financial contracts against applicable banking organizations, and record-keeping requirements for qualified financial contracts. All of these new rules, as well as others being considered by regulators in other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities.

We are also subject to various rules and regulations related to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, including the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001. These rules and regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, fraud, compliance, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully effective or do not meet heightened regulatory standards or expectations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences.

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities relating to the privacy of the information of customers, team members and others. These laws and regulations, among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches; and provide for significantly increased penalties for non-compliance.

In April 2018, the SEC proposed a rule that would require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. This rule may impact the manner in which business is conducted with customers seeking investment advice and may affect certain investment product offerings. 

On November 18, 2016, the OCC revoked provisions of certain consent orders that provided Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. relief from specific requirements and limitations regarding rules, policies, and procedures for corporate activities; OCC approval of changes in directors and senior executive officers; and golden parachute payments. As a result, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is no longer eligible for expedited treatment for certain applications; is now required to provide prior written notice to the OCC of a change in directors and senior executive officers; and is now subject to certain regulatory limitations on golden parachute payments.

In March 2017, we announced that the OCC had downgraded our most recent Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating, which covers the years 2009-2012, to “Needs to Improve” due to previously issued regulatory consent orders. A “Needs to Improve” rating imposes regulatory restrictions and limitations on certain of the Company’s nonbank activities, including its ability to engage in certain nonbank mergers and acquisitions or undertake new financial in nature activities, and CRA performance is taken into account by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches and for approving proposed bank mergers and acquisitions. The rating also results in the loss of expedited processing of applications to undertake certain activities, and requires the Company to receive 

prior regulatory approval for certain activities, including to issue or prepay certain subordinated debt obligations, open or relocate bank branches, or make certain public welfare investments. In addition, a “Needs to Improve” rating could have an impact on the Company’s relationships with certain states, counties, municipalities or other public agencies to the extent applicable law, regulation or policy limits, restricts or influences whether such entity may do business with a company that has a below “Satisfactory” rating.

On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the FRB. As required by the consent order, the Board submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The consent order requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete third-party reviews of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until these third-party reviews are complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Compliance with this asset cap will be measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. Additionally, after removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.

On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the CFPB and OCC to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. 

The Company may be subject to further actions, including the imposition of consent orders or similar regulatory agreements or civil money penalties, by other federal regulators regarding similar issues, including the Company’s risk management policies and procedures. Compliance with the FRB consent order, the CFPB and OCC consent orders, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well as the implementation of their requirements, may increase the Company’s costs and require the Company to undergo significant changes to its business, products and services.

Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly affect our business include proposals to reform the housing finance market in the United States. These proposals, among other things, consider winding down the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as the implementation of reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of a loan that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, 

 Wells Fargo & Company125

Risk Factors (continued)

improving underwriting standards, and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. Congress also may consider the adoption of legislation to reform the mortgage financing market in an effort to assist borrowers experiencing difficulty in making mortgage payments or refinancing their mortgages. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain.

Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, also could significantly change our regulatory environment and increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial services companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.

For more information, refer to the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2018 Form 10-K. 

We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or recovery plan is deficient. Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, Wells Fargo has prepared and filed a resolution plan, a so-called “living will,” that is designed to facilitate our resolution in the event of material distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. If the FRB or FDIC determines that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB or FDIC ultimately determines that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. 

We must also prepare and submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. Our insured national bank subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), must also prepare and submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the Bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.

Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of Wells Fargo, whether in a bankruptcy proceeding or under the orderly liquidation authority of the FDIC, even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 

effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances.

Whether under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority, Wells Fargo could be resolved using a “multiple point of entry” strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution proceedings, or a “single point of entry” strategy, in which the Parent would likely be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. The FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan submission is a multiple point of entry strategy; however, we have made a decision to move to a single point of entry strategy for our next resolution plan submission. We are not obligated to maintain either a single point of entry or multiple point of entry strategy, and the strategies reflected in our resolution plan submissions are not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority.

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries in order to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company using either a single point of entry or multiple point of entry resolution strategy, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into the Support Agreement with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), and the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (“WFS”), and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (“WFCS”), each an indirect subsidiary of the Parent. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank pursuant to the Support Agreement and to WFS and WFCS through repurchase facilities entered into in connection with the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as 

126Wells Fargo & Company 

usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, the subordinated notes would be forgiven and the committed line of credit would terminate, which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. The Parent’s and the IHC’s respective obligations under the Support Agreement are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.

Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s security holders could face significant or complete losses. This outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted using a multiple point of entry or a single point of entry strategy. Furthermore, in a multiple point of entry or single point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses than if the strategy had not been implemented.

Bank regulations, including Basel capital and liquidity standards and FRB guidelines and rules, may require higher capital and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our business, or provide loans or other products and services to our customers. The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In particular, the Company is subject to final and interim final rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These rules are based on international guidelines for determining regulatory capital issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, among other things, require on a fully phased-in basis: 

•a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.0%, comprised of a 4.5% minimum requirement plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and for us, as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge to be calculated annually, which is 2.0% based on our year-end 2017 data;

•a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%, comprised of a 6.0% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.0%;

•a minimum total capital ratio of 12.5%, comprised of a 8.0% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.0%;

•a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% to be added to the minimum capital ratios, which is currently not in effect but could be imposed by regulators at their discretion if it is determined that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk;

•a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%; and

•a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 5.0% (comprised of a 3.0% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%) for large and internationally active bank holding companies (BHCs).

We were required to comply with the final Basel III capital rules beginning January 2014, with certain provisions subject to phase-in periods. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. However, the requirements for calculating tier 2 and total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements. The entire Basel III capital rules are scheduled to be fully phased in by the end of 2021.

On April 10, 2018, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would add a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer to the minimum capital and tier 1 leverage ratio requirements. The buffers would be calculated based on the decrease in a financial institution’s risk-based capital and tier 1 leverage ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario in CCAR, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The stress capital buffer would replace the 2.5% capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Approach, whereas the stress leverage buffer would be added to the current 4% minimum tier 1 leverage ratio.

Because the Company has been designated as a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule implementing the additional capital surcharge of between 1.0-4.5% on G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under two prescribed methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The G-SIB surcharge became fully effective on January 1, 2019. Based on year-end 2017 data, our 2019 G-SIB surcharge is 2.0% of the Company’s RWAs. However, because the G-SIB surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years.

In April 2014, federal banking regulators finalized a rule that enhances the SLR requirements for BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions. The SLR consists of tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Company’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of the total average on-balance sheet assets, plus off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivative exposures, less amounts permitted to be deducted from tier 1 capital. The rule, which became effective on January 1, 2018, requires a covered BHC to maintain a SLR of at least 5.0% (comprised of the 3.0% minimum requirement plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The rule also requires that all of our insured depository institutions maintain a SLR of 6.0% under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. In April 2018, the FRB and OCC proposed rules (the “Proposed SLR Rules”) that would replace the 2% supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of the firm’s G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR Rules would similarly tailor the current 6% SLR requirement for our insured depository institutions.

In December 2016, the FRB finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under the rules, which became effective on January 1, 2019, U.S. G-SIBs are required to have a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1 capital and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) equal to the greater of (i) 18% of RWAs and (ii) 7.5% of total leverage exposure (the denominator of the SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs are required to maintain (i) a TLAC 

 Wells Fargo & Company127

Risk Factors (continued)

buffer equal to 2.5% of RWAs plus the firm’s applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method one of the G-SIB calculation plus any applicable countercyclical buffer to be added to the 18% minimum and (ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer equal to 2.0% of total leverage exposure to be added to the 7.5% minimum, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The rules also require U.S. G-SIBs to have a minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 6.0% of RWAs plus the firm’s applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method two of the G-SIB calculation and (ii) 4.5% of the total leverage exposure. In addition, the rules impose certain restrictions on the operations and liabilities of the top-tier or covered BHC in order to further facilitate an orderly resolution, including prohibitions on the issuance of short-term debt to external investors and on entering into derivatives and certain other types of financial contracts with external counterparties. While the rules permit permanent grandfathering of a significant portion of otherwise ineligible long-term debt that was issued prior to December 31, 2016, long-term debt issued after that date must be fully compliant with the eligibility requirements of the rules in order to count toward the minimum TLAC amount. As a result of the rules, we will need to issue additional long-term debt to remain compliant with the requirements. Under the Proposed SLR Rules, the 2% external TLAC leverage buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to one-half of the firm’s G-SIB capital surcharge. Additionally, the Proposed SLR Rules would modify the leverage component for calculating the minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt from 4.5% of total leverage exposure to 2.5% of total leverage exposure plus one-half of the firm’s G-SIB capital surcharge.

In September 2014, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the BCBS. The rule requires banking institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as central bank reserves and government and corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. The FRB also finalized rules imposing enhanced liquidity management standards on large BHCs such as Wells Fargo, and has finalized a rule that requires large bank holding companies to publicly disclose on a quarterly basis certain quantitative and qualitative information regarding their LCR calculations.

As part of its obligation to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB issued a final capital plan rule that requires large BHCs, including the Company, to submit annual capital plans for review and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions. There can be no assurance that the FRB would respond favorably to the Company’s future capital plans. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. The FRB has also finalized enhanced prudential standards that implement single counterparty credit limits, and has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established 

heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks, such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, including as a result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, proposed capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may increase our compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products and services to our customers. 

For more information, refer to the “Capital Management” and “Regulatory Matters” sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” section of our 2018 Form 10-K.

FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB has stated that in determining the timing and size of any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FRB will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation. As noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and a flattening yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and debt securities on our balance sheet.

CREDIT RISK

As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit 

128Wells Fargo & Company 

losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices and higher unemployment, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses.

Our provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion less than net charge-offs in 2018, which had a positive effect on our earnings. Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2018, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report.

We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize or our consumer Pick-a-Pay loans reach their recast trigger.

We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases in interest rates, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes in consumer behavior or other market 

conditions, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 

Challenges and/or changes in foreign economic conditions may increase our foreign credit risk. Our foreign loan exposure represented approximately 8% of our total consolidated outstanding loans and 4% of our total assets at December 31, 2018. Economic difficulties in foreign jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit performance and results of operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have foreign operations. 

In order to reduce credit risk and obtain additional funding, from time to time we may securitize or sell similar types or categories of loans that we originate, such as mortgage loans and automobile loans. The agreements under which we do this generally contain various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the loans. We may be required to repurchase the loans, reimburse investors and others, or incur other losses, including regulatory fines and penalties, as a result of any breaches in these contractual representations and warranties. For more information about our repurchase obligations with respect to mortgage loans, refer to the “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Mortgage Business” section in this Report.

For more information regarding credit risk, refer to the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

We may incur losses on loans, securities and other acquired assets of Wachovia that are materially greater than reflected in our fair value adjustments. We accounted for the Wachovia merger under the purchase method of accounting, recording the acquired assets and liabilities of Wachovia at fair value. All PCI loans acquired in the merger were recorded at fair value based on the present value of their expected cash flows. We estimated cash flows using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models using assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We may not realize the estimated cash flows or fair value of these loans. In addition, although the difference between the pre-merger carrying value of the credit-impaired loans and their expected cash flows – the “nonaccretable difference” – is available to absorb future charge-offs, we may be required to increase our allowance for credit losses and related provision expense because of subsequent additional credit deterioration in these loans.

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section in this Report.

OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. As a large financial institution that serves customers through numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking and other distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet 

 Wells Fargo & Company129

Risk Factors (continued)

and mobile banking to provide products and services to our customers, and as customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; climate change related impacts and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information security breaches. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities, which was triggered by a smoke alarm that resulted from a steam condition created by routine maintenance activities in the building. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers. For instance, our online and mobile banking systems and certain ATM functions experienced disruptions for several hours, and certain critical mortgage origination systems experienced disruptions for several days.

As a result of financial institutions and technology systems becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational risk to us, including from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the performance of their responsibilities. We are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common service provider to those third parties could impede their ability to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences. 

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

A cyber attack or other information security breach of our technologies, computer systems or networks, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to obtain loans or other financial products from us or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers’ devices may become the target of cyber attacks or other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt Wells Fargo’s or its customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that a team member or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents controls for personal gain or other improper purposes.

Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of financial institutions and technology systems, an information security incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology and cloud service providers, could be sources of information security risk 

130Wells Fargo & Company 

to us. If those third parties fail to adequately or appropriately safeguard their technologies, systems, and networks, we may suffer material harm, including business disruptions, losses or remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences.

To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the current global economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other financial institutions continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware and denial-of-service, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, potentially test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity and other information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses associated with an information security breach.

Cyber attacks or other information security breaches affecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in mitigating risk and loss to us. Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, 

measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We are also exposed to risks if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise. In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and predict risks, such as market and interest rate risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict future events or exposures. The recent financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Risks related to sales practices and other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Various government entities and offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations or examinations arising out of certain sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. In addition to imposing monetary penalties and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with such matters, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other direct and indirect adverse consequences. A number of lawsuits have also been filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these sales practices. The ultimate resolution of any of these pending legal proceedings or government investigations, depending on the sanctions and 

 Wells Fargo & Company131

Risk Factors (continued)

remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may also incur additional costs and expenses in order to address and defend these pending legal proceedings and government investigations, and we may have increased compliance and other costs related to these matters. Furthermore, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified team members, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the ultimate results and conclusions of our company-wide review of sales practices issues are still pending and could lead to an increase in the identified number of potentially impacted customers, additional legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, the identification of issues in our practices or methodologies that were used to identify, prevent or remediate sales practices related matters, the loss of additional team members, or further changes in policies and procedures that may impact our business.

Furthermore, our priority of rebuilding trust has included an ongoing effort to identify other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. For example, we have identified certain issues related to historical practices concerning the origination, servicing, and/or collection of consumer automobile loans, including matters related to certain insurance products. The identification of such other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences.

For more information, refer to the “Overview – Retail Sales Practices Matters” and “– Additional Efforts to Rebuild Trust” sections and Note 16 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.

We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations, or from any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasing regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject to consent orders with regulators that subject us to various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal and state law or differences between U.S. and foreign laws as to the products and services we may offer or other business activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance difficulties or issues. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require us to report transactions and other information to regulators and other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We are also required to withhold funds and make various tax-related payments, relating to our own tax obligations and those of our customers. We may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on 

our business, or other negative consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately provide regulatory reports, customer notices or disclosures, or make tax-related withholdings or payments, on behalf of ourselves or our customers. Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties or restrictions on certain activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent orders, could result in fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, loss of customers or other negative consequences.

Negative publicity, including as a result of our actual or alleged conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and business. Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased substantially because of the financial crisis, our size and profile in the financial services industry, and sales practices related matters and other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, automobile or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; corporate governance; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by team members and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our team members and others, 

132Wells Fargo & Company 

including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our team members interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets.

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking locations and have resulted in negative public commentary about financial institutions, including the fees charged for various products and services. Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to negative publicity as a result of providing financial services to or making investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or negative publicity for the Company specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and financial results.

Risks related to legal actions. Wells Fargo and some of its subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business activities. Although we believe we have a meritorious defense in all significant legal actions pending against us, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition to imposing monetary penalties and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. 

For more information, refer to Note 16 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR MORTGAGE BUSINESS

Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates on our origination activity and on the value of our MSRs, MLHFS and associated economic hedges, and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new mortgage loans. We are one of the largest mortgage originators and residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a sizable portfolio of MSRs. An MSR is the right to service a mortgage loan – collect principal, interest and escrow amounts – for a fee. We acquire MSRs when we retain the servicing rights after we 

sell or securitize the loans we have originated or when we purchase the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders. We initially measure and carry all our residential MSRs using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we evaluate the fair value of our MSRs, and any decrease in fair value reduces earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. We also measure at fair value MLHFS for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist. In addition, we measure at fair value certain other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations. Similar to other interest-bearing securities, the value of these MLHFS and other interests may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. For example, if market interest rates increase relative to the yield on these MLHFS and other interests, their fair value may fall.

When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.

We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. We may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. We could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. There may be periods where we elect not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.

We rely on GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) to insure loans that meet their policy requirements. These loans are then securitized into either GSE or GNMA securities that are sold to investors. In order to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either GSE or FHA standards, which are referred to as “nonconforming” loans. We generally retain these nonconforming loans on our balance sheet. When we retain a loan on our balance sheet not only do we forgo fee revenue and keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. If we were unable or unwilling to continue retaining nonconforming loans on our balance sheet, whether due to regulatory, business 

 Wells Fargo & Company133

Risk Factors (continued)

or other reasons, our ability to originate new nonconforming loans may be reduced, thereby reducing the interest income we earn from originating these loans. Similarly, if the GSEs or the FHA were to limit or reduce their purchases or insuring of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate new mortgage loans, could also be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or the FHA will not materially limit their purchases or insuring of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). Each of the GSEs is currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency acting as conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorship will end, or any associated changes to the GSEs business structure and operations that could result. As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, including whether the GSEs will continue to exist in their current form, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain.

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” and “Critical Accounting Policies” sections in this Report.

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties, and we may incur other losses as a result of real or alleged violations of statutes or regulations applicable to the origination of our residential mortgage loans. The origination of residential mortgage loans is governed by a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Truth in Lending Act of 1968 and various anti-fraud and consumer protection statutes, which are complex and frequently changing. We often sell residential mortgage loans that we originate to various parties, including GSEs, SPEs that issue private label MBS, and other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. We may also pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans which back securities guaranteed by GNMA. The agreements under which we sell mortgage loans and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability related to the various representations and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for loans which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market worsen or future investor repurchase demand and our success at appealing repurchase requests differ from past experience, we could have increased repurchase 

obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase liability.

Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we originate, borrowers may allege that the origination of the loans did not comply with applicable laws or regulations in one or more respects and assert such violation as an affirmative defense to payment or to the exercise by us of our remedies, including foreclosure proceedings, or in an action seeking statutory and other damages in connection with such violation. If we are not successful in demonstrating that the loans in dispute were originated in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations, we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans.

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses” section in this Report. 

We may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions. We act as servicer and/or master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a servicer or master servicer for those loans we have certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or other third parties, including, in our capacity as a servicer, foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales and, in our capacity as a master servicer, overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer. In addition, we may have certain servicing obligations for properties that fall within a flood zone. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders, causing us to lose servicing income. In addition, we may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. Furthermore, if any of the companies that insure the mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio experience financial difficulties or credit downgrades, we may incur additional costs to obtain replacement insurance coverage with another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we would replace. In some cases, if we do not satisfy our servicing obligations, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses, which could significantly reduce our net servicing income.

We may incur costs, liabilities to borrowers, title insurers and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or other adverse consequences if we fail to meet our obligations with respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or we experience delays in the foreclosure process. The fair value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs. We may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal 

134Wells Fargo & Company 

or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices or our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses” and “– Risks Relating to Servicing Activities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” sections and Note 15 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other Commitments) and Note 16 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY’S COMPETITIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny stemming from the financial crisis, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customer relationships and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Continued technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including digital currencies, may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, and/or develop new products and services to respond to our customers’ needs. To the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new products and services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we 

may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Our ability to attract and retain qualified team members is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects. The success of Wells Fargo is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our team members, including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, capital markets, risk management and technology, the competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also seek to retain a pipeline of team members to provide continuity of succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract and retain highly qualified team members, we must provide competitive compensation and effectively manage team member performance and development. As a large financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these qualified team members, especially if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified team members, including successors for senior leadership positions, our business performance, competitive position and future prospects may be adversely affected.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, and changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition. As described below, some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements.

From time to time the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. For example, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 - Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which becomes effective in first quarter 2020, will replace the current “incurred loss” model for the allowance for credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. CECL could materially affect how we determine our allowance and report our financial results and condition. 

In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.

For more information, refer to the “Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report.

Risk Factors (continued)

Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves for mortgage repurchases, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For a description of these policies, refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.

Certain of our financial instruments, including derivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment, and there is no assurance that our models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be “independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences.

RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC DECISIONS 

If we are unable to develop and execute effective business plans or strategies, our competitive standing and results of operations could suffer. We are subject to rapid changes in technology, regulation, and product innovation, 

and face intense competition for customers, sources of revenue, capital, services, qualified team members, and other essential business resources. In order to meet these challenges, we may undertake business plans or strategies related to, among other things, our organizational structure and risk management framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products and services we offer, the geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, and require significant financial, technological, management and other resources, and there is no guarantee that any business plans or strategies will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are unable to develop or execute effective business plans or strategies, our competitive position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, we regularly explore opportunities to expand our products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key team members, an increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and team members or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the acquired company or business operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations and/or team members.

Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2019 for material changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could adversely affect our financial results and condition.

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2018, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that:

•pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company;

•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during any quarter in 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth below and should be read with these limitations in mind. 

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
