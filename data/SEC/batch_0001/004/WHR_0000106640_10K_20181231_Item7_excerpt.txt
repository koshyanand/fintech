ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data included in this Form 10-K. Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

OVERVIEW

Whirlpool had a full-year GAAP net loss available to Whirlpool of $183 million compared to GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool of $350 million in the same prior-year period. Non-recurring items negatively impacted full-year net loss available to Whirlpool by approximately $850 million, including asset impairment charges related to the EMEA region and a settlement with the French Competition Authority ("FCA").

Whirlpool delivered ongoing (non-GAAP) EBIT margin of 6.3% for the full-year, overcoming significant external challenges. These results were driven by positive global price/mix and strong cost discipline, which were offset by significant cost inflation and lower EMEA results. In addition, we delivered very strong cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow driven by sustainable working capital improvement and the timing of certain payments.

We are pleased with the successful execution of our cost-based price increases, delivering positive price/mix in all regions. In addition, we took strong actions to address the weaker than anticipated results in EMEA and offset significant cost and currency challenges.

We are confident that our strategy and actions will drive positive results in 2019 and remain committed to generating strong free cash flow and margin expansion.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

nm: not meaningful

Consolidated net sales for 2018 decreased 1.0% compared to 2017, primarily driven by unit volume declines and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by favorable impacts from product price/mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, consolidated net sales for 2018 decreased 0.1% compared to 2017. Consolidated net sales for 2017 increased 2.6% compared to 2016 primarily driven by favorable impacts from product price/mix and foreign currency. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, consolidated net sales for 2017 increased 1.5% compared to 2016. 

Effective January 1, 2018, we realigned the composition of certain segments to align with our new leadership reporting structure. We now report our Mexico business as a part of our Latin America segment and have shifted certain adjacent business from the North America segment to the Asia segment. The determination of the Company's reportable segments was not affected by these changes. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. 

For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures including net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

The chart below summarizes the balance of net sales by operating segments for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2018 decreased to 16.8% compared to 16.9% in 2017, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact from raw material inflation across all regions, tariffs and higher freight costs in the North America region, lower unit volumes in the EMEA region, partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix and restructuring benefits. The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2017 decreased to 16.9% compared to 17.8% in 2016, primarily driven by unfavorable impacts from raw material inflation across all regions and product price/mix in the EMEA region, partially offset by cost productivity and restructuring benefits.

Selling, General and Administrative

The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2018 increased compared to 2017 due to expenses related to the bad debt expense from a Brazilian retailer, expenses related to the pending sale of the Embraco compressor business and the negative impact of unit volume declines. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2017 remained flat compared to 2016.

Restructuring

We incurred restructuring charges of $247 million, $275 million and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the full year 2019, we expect to incur up to $100 million of restructuring charges, as we reduce fixed costs primarily in the EMEA region. 

For additional information about restructuring activities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles

We recorded an impairment charge of $747 million related to goodwill ($579 million) and other intangibles ($168 million) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 related to the EMEA reporting unit.

For additional information, see Note 5 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Interest and Sundry (Income) Expense

Interest and sundry (income) expenses were $108 million, $87 million and $93 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest and sundry (income) expense increased $21 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the French Competition Authority (FCA) settlement agreement, partially offset by Latin America tax credits and a favorable impact from foreign currency. During 2017, interest and sundry (income) expense decreased $6 million compared to 2016, primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign currency.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $192 million, $162 million and $161 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense increased by $30 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This was primarily due to higher average debt and notes payable balances and higher average interest rates. During 2017, interest expense increased by $1 million compared to 2016. This was primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances. 

Income Taxes

Income tax expense was $138 million, $550 million and $186 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in tax expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to lower level of earnings, the reduction in statutory U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21%, impact of non deductible goodwill impairments and government payment accruals, valuation allowances and tax planning actions.

29

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

The increase in tax expense in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to the one-time charge of approximately $420 million as result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the impact from a reduced tax rate on the valuations of deferred tax assets, the one-time deemed repatriation tax and other related items. Excluding the impact from tax reform, the decrease in tax expense compared to 2016 is primarily due to increased tax planning benefits.

For additional information about our consolidated tax provision, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE

Full year 2019 guidance measures of GAAP earnings per diluted share and free cash flow do not reflect the anticipated gain on sale and, in the case of free cash flow, proceeds from the sale of the Embraco compressor business. The final amounts are subject to a number of variables that are subject to change, including the net book value of held for sale assets, closing costs, taxes and customary adjustments for indebtedness, cash and working capital at closing.

Earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2019 full-year tax rate between 15% and 20%. We currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2019 to be within the following ranges:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Reflects industry demand in the United States.

(2) Reflects industry demand in Brazil.

For the full-year 2019, we expect to generate cash from operating activities of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million to $900 million, including restructuring cash outlays of up to $100 million and, with respect to free cash flow, capital expenditures of approximately $625 million. 

The table below reconciles projected 2019 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations. We define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses, and changes in restricted cash. The change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by Whirlpool to acquire majority control of Whirlpool China (formerly Hefei Sanyo) in 2014 and which are used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance Whirlpool China's research and development and working capital, as required by the terms of the Hefei Sanyo acquisition completed in October 2014. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Financial guidance on a GAAP basis for cash provided by (used in) financing activities and cash provided by (used in) investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection, the Company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control.

The projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the Board of Directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as "ongoing" measures, including:

•Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 

•Ongoing EBIT

•Ongoing EBIT margin

•Sales excluding currency 

•Ongoing net sales 

•Free cash flow

Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing ongoing EBIT by net sales for 2018 and ongoing net sales for 2017. Ongoing net sales for 2017 excludes $32 million primarily related to an adjustment for trade promotion accruals in prior periods. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We also disclose segment EBIT, which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense, and ongoing segment EBIT as important financial metrics used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280 - Segment Reporting. The Company provides free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the Company's control. 

We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool, net sales, and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Please refer to a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt and reduce liquidity risk. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding the business through capital and research and development spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives, funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities, providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions.

Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, and returns to shareholders. We also have $947 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options, which may include repayment through refinancing, free cash flow generation, or cash on hand.

Notes payable consists of short-term borrowings payable to banks or commercial paper, which are generally used to fund working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we have $1,034 million of notes payable outstanding which consists of short-term borrowings payable to banks. We have no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2018. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Whirlpool of India Limited (Whirlpool India), a majority-owned subsidiary of Whirlpool Corporation, announced in June 2018 that it had reached an agreement to acquire a 49% equity interest in Elica PB India. As part of the agreement, Whirlpool India received an option to acquire the remaining equity interest in the future for fair value, and the non-Whirlpool India shareholders of Elica PB India received an option to sell their remaining equity interest to Whirlpool India in the future for fair value, which could be material to the financial statements depending on the performance of the venture. This transaction closed in the third quarter of 2018. 

32

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, and derivative counterparty banks regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short-term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty. 

As of December 31, 2018, we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in China and Brazil, which represented 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively. In addition, we did not have any third-party accounts receivable greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of the United States, with the exception of Italy and Mexico, which represented 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, of which substantially all was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.

We continue to review customer conditions globally. As of December 31, 2018, we had 286 million reais (approximately $74 million) in short and long-term receivables due to us from Maquina de Vendas S.A. In 2018, as part of their extrajudicial recovery plan, we agreed to receive payment of our outstanding receivable, plus interest, over eight years under a tiered payment schedule. As of December 31, 2018, we have 127 million reais (approximately $32 million) of insurance against this credit risk through policies purchased from high-quality underwriters. 

On October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings Corporation ("Sears") announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection. As of December 31, 2018, we had an immaterial accounts receivable and inventory exposure related to Sears. We believe the Sears bankruptcy will have a very limited short-term impact on our results of operations as consumers adjust to the new retail landscape. Furthermore, we do not believe that the bankruptcy will materially impact our financial results over the long term. 

In the past, when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network, we generally have been able to offset such declines through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network. 

For additional information on transfers and servicing of financial assets, accounts payable outsourcing and guarantees, see Note 1 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on guarantees, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Embraco Sale Transaction

On April 24, 2018, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a purchase agreement with Nidec Corporation, a leading manufacturer of electric motors incorporated under the laws of Japan, to sell our Embraco business unit.

Pursuant to the purchase agreement, at the closing of the transaction, Nidec will pay a purchase price of approximately $1.08 billion for the sale of Embraco. The purchase price is subject to customary adjustments including for indebtedness, cash and working capital of Embraco at closing. Whirlpool has agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to tax, environmental, labor and products following closing of the transaction. The purchase agreement contains customary representations, conditions, warranties and covenants of the parties, including the requirement to obtain necessary antitrust approvals, which have been received in the U.S., Brazil and China, and are still being considered in Europe and certain other jurisdictions. 

The purchase agreement contains a closing deadline of April 24, 2019. In the unlikely event that closing does not occur by the closing deadline, the agreement permits closing up to six months later. The specific rights and obligations of the parties can be found in the purchase agreement, which is incorporated by reference into Exhibit 2(i) to this annual report of Form 10-K. 

For additional information on the Embraco sale transaction, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Share Repurchase Program

For additional information about our share repurchase program, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources and Uses of Cash

We met our cash needs during 2018 through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2018 increased $245 million compared to the same period in 2017. 

The following table summarizes the net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented. Significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2018 are discussed below:

Cash Flow Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2018 primarily reflects $350 million of discretionary pension funding, partially offset by the working capital impact from inventory reduction efforts, lower volumes and credit management activities. Net loss includes the non-cash impacts from impairment of goodwill and other intangibles.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2017 was primarily driven by effective credit management, improvement in working capital and lower cash expenditures related to legacy product corrective action, partially offset by lower net earnings.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2016 reflects strong cash earnings and effective credit management and the impact of cash expenditures related to legacy product corrective action.

The timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels, sales patterns, promotional programs, funding requirements, credit management, as well as receivable and payment terms. Depending on the timing of cash flows, the location of cash balances, as well as the liquidity requirements of each country, external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 primarily reflects a decrease in capital expenditures (approximately $95 million), proceeds from a real estate sale-leaseback transaction (approximately $130 million) and the proceeds related to held-to-maturity securities (approximately $60 million).

The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures (approximately $25 million) and the net impact of purchases (approximately $170 million) and proceeds (approximately $110 million) related to held-to-maturity securities.

Cash used in investing activities in 2016 primarily reflects capital expenditures (approximately $660 million).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

In June 2016, Whirlpool China Co., Ltd. ("Whirlpool China"), our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two Whirlpool China plants in Hefei, China to a division of the Hefei municipal government. The aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately RMB 687 million (approximately $103 million as of June 27, 2016). Whirlpool China received RMB 127 million (approximately $20 million) in 2018 and RMB 280 million (approximately $42 million) in 2017 and 2016. The related cash flow impact from these transactions is included in investing activities in each respective year.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2018 primarily reflects higher proceeds from borrowings of short-term debt (increase of approximately $300 million) and lower repayments of long-term debt (decrease of approximately $175 million), partially offset by higher share repurchase activity (increase of approximately $400 million). We also acquired the remaining minority interest in a subsidiary.

Cash used in financing activities during 2017 primarily reflects share repurchase activity and proceeds from borrowings (short-term and long-term) and repayments of long-term debt. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher share repurchase activity (increase of approximately $225 million). 

Cash used in financing activities during 2016 primarily reflects share repurchase activity and proceeds from borrowings (short-term and long-term) and repayments of long-term debt.

Dividends paid in financing activities approximated $300 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Whirlpool Subsidiary Share Repurchase

On July 12, 2016, Whirlpool S.A. ("WHR SA") and Brasmotor S.A. ("BMT"), both majority-owned indirect subsidiaries of Whirlpool Corporation, issued public announcements in Brazil reporting that Whirlpool do Brasil Ltda., the controlling shareholder of both WHR SA and BMT, intended to acquire the outstanding common and preferred shares of WHR SA and BMT by means of tender offers for the publicly-held shares. At that time, Whirlpool do Brasil Ltda. and other Whirlpool entities held 99.20% of the common and 95.68% of the preferred shares of WHR SA and 99.40% of the common and 93.55% of the preferred shares of BMT. The tender offers were launched in November 2016 and concluded in December 2016. The offer for BMT was successful and the squeeze-out was completed in January 2017 at a total cost of approximately $31 million. The WHR SA tender offer was abandoned because the minimum number of interested minority shareholders was not obtained.

Financing Arrangements

The Company had total committed credit facilities of approximately $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. The facilities reflect the Company's growing global operations. The Company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations. We had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends

In April 2018, our Board of Directors approved a 4.5% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.15 per share from $1.10 per share.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and other governmental obligations and debt agreements. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately $355 million and $407 million outstanding under these agreements, respectively.

For additional information about our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 1 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee's expected period of employment. The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation, respectively. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2018 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2019 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our December 31, 2018 retirement obligations and 2019 retirement benefit costs of our United States plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for other postretirement benefit plans.

These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years' financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results. For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had total deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion, net of valuation allowances of $348 million and $178 million, respectively. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by U.S. energy tax credits, foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws. 

In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 1, Note 7 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Warranty Obligations

The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates 

37

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangibles

Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had goodwill of approximately $2.5 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. We have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets as of October 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinite-life intangible assets is below the carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment.

In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible; actual and projected revenue and EBIT margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible is less than its carrying value.

For our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2018, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks. The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinite-life intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment.

During the second quarter of 2018, we identified impairment indicators for the goodwill in our EMEA reporting unit and the Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks based on our qualitative assessment, which required us to complete an interim quantitative impairment assessment.

Goodwill Valuations

In performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate each reporting unit's fair value primarily by using the income approach. The income approach uses each reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The financial projections reflect management's best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected period including forecasted revenue growth, EBIT margin, tax rate, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values.

Additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units. We also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations.

Interim impairment assessment

In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for the three months ended June 30, 2018, we identified indicators of goodwill impairment for our EMEA reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment, which required us to complete an interim quantitative impairment assessment. The primary indicator of

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

38

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

impairment for our EMEA reporting unit was the segment's continuing negative financial performance in 2018 that did not improve as anticipated, primarily driven by significant volume loss. The actual operating results for the three-months ended June 30, 2018 were significantly lower than forecasted resulting in weak business performance. While the Indesit integration activities were substantially complete, as of the interim impairment date, the operating and macro-environment in the EMEA region continued to be very challenging and had not improved as anticipated. While our commercial transformation and supply chain initiatives were progressing, as of the impairment determination date, progress on market share recovery was slower than previously anticipated and the business has been impacted by raw material inflation and currency headwinds.

In evaluating the EMEA reporting unit, significant weight was provided to the forecasted EBIT margins and discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model, as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit.

The average 5-year forecasted EBIT margin in the discounted cash flow model was approximately 5% and the discount rate was 12% based on market participant assumptions.

Based on our interim quantitative impairment assessment, the carrying value of the EMEA reporting unit exceeded its fair value by $579 million and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of 2018.

Annual impairment assessment

Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2018, the fair values of our NAR, Asia and LAR reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 111%, 165% and 31%, respectively.

Based on the quantitative assessment performed for the EMEA reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 1%, which was consistent with management's expectation given the short time period between our interim and annual impairment assessments. The EMEA reporting unit has goodwill of approximately $300 million at December 31, 2018.

In evaluating the EMEA reporting unit, significant weight was provided to the forecasted EBIT margins and discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model, as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit.

•Forecasted EBIT margins are expected to recover as we stabilize volumes, sustain price/mix and recover market share and benefit from the recently announced strategic actions to rightsize and refocus the business. The 5-year average forecasted EBIT margin in the discounted cash flow model was approximately 4%.

•We used a discount rate of 11.25% based on market participant assumptions.

We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 5% reduction in the projected EBIT margins in the forecasted periods would result in an impairment charge of $278 million and $148 million, respectively.

If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Indefinite-Life Intangible Valuations

In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.

Interim impairment assessment

In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for three months ended June 30, 2018, we identified indicators of impairment associated with other intangible assets in our EMEA reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment, which required us to complete an interim quantitative impairment assessment. The primary indicator of impairment was the continuing decline in revenue from weaker volumes through the six months ended June 30, 2018 that did not improve as anticipated. The actual operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2018 were significantly lower than forecasted.

In performing the quantitative analysis on these assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty method includes revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate.

We used a royalty rate and discount rate of 3% and 15%, respectively, for Indesit and a royalty rate and discount rate of 3.5% and 15.5%, respectively, for Hotpoint*.

Based on our interim quantitative impairment assessment, the carrying value of certain other intangible assets, including Indesit and Hotpoint*, exceeded their fair value, and we recorded an impairment charge of $168 million during the second quarter of 2018.

Annual impairment assessment

Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2018, we determined there was an immaterial impairment as a result of the restructuring initiative to exit from domestic sales operations (not including manufacturing operations) in Turkey. There were no other impairments of indefinite-life intangible assets in 2018.

The fair value of the Indesit trademark exceeded its carrying value of $220 million by less than 1%. The fair value of the Hotpoint* trademark approximated its carrying value of $155 million. We expect revenue trends for both these brands to improve as we stabilize volumes, recover market share and benefit from our new product investments in the EMEA region.

The fair value of the Maytag trademark exceeded its carrying value of $1,021 million by approximately 2%. We expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we recover temporary volume loss from previously announced cost-based price increases, and continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments.

The fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 20%.

In performing the quantitative assessment on these assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.

Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10% reduction of forecasted revenues in the Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag trademarks would result in an impairment charge of approximately $23 million, $23 million and $81 million, respectively.

In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given market segment. Based on this analysis, we determined a royalty rate of 3%, 3.5% and 4% for our Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag trademarks, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rates from each brand would result in an impairment charge of approximately $35 million, $46 million and $106 million, respectively.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

40

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets. Based on this analysis, we determined the discount rates to be 15%, 15.5% and 10% for Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $17 million, $17 million and $101 million, respectively.

If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

For additional information about goodwill and indefinite-life intangible valuations, see Note 5 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.

OTHER MATTERS

For additional information regarding certain of our loss contingencies/litigation, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Grenfell Tower

On June 23, 2017, London's Metropolitan Police Service released a statement that it had identified a Hotpoint–branded refrigerator as the initial source of the Grenfell Tower fire in West London. U.K. authorities are conducting investigations, including regarding the cause and spread of the fire. The model in question was manufactured by Indesit Company between 2006 and 2009, prior to Whirlpool's acquisition of Indesit in 2014. We are fully cooperating with the investigating authorities. As these matters are ongoing, we cannot speculate on their eventual outcomes or potential impact on our financial statements; accordingly, we have not recorded any significant charges in 2017 and 2018. Claims may be filed related to this incident.

Antidumping and Safeguard Petition

As previously reported, Whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that Samsung, LG and Electrolux violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping washers into the U.S. Those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain washers imported from South Korea, Mexico, and China, and countervailing duties on certain washers from South Korea. These orders could be subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals. The South Korea and Mexico orders are currently being reviewed to determine whether the orders should continue to remain in effect for another five years. 

Whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in May 2017 to address our concerns that Samsung and LG are evading U.S. trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders. A safeguard remedy went into effect in February 2018, implementing tariffs on finished washers and certain covered parts for three years. During the second year of the remedy, beginning February 7, 2019, the remedy imposes an 18% tariff on the first 1.2 million large residential 

washing machines imported into the United States and a 45% tariff on such imports in excess of 1.2 million, and also imposes a 45% tariff on washer tub, drum, and cabinet imports in excess of 70,000 units. The tariff rates on washers

and covered parts will decline slightly during the third year of the remedy. The safeguard remedy will be subject to an interim review by the International Trade Commission during 2019.

U.S. Tariffs and Global Economy

The current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. The impact of previously-announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum was a component of increased raw material costs during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect these and other tariffs to impact material costs in future quarters, which could require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period.
