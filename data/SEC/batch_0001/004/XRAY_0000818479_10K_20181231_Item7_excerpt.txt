On February 29, 2016, DENTSPLY International Inc. merged with Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. (“Sirona”) to form Dentsply Sirona Inc. (the “Merger”). The accompanying financial information for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016, include the results of operations for Sirona for the period February 29, 2016 to December 31, 2016.

References to the ”combined business” or the “combined businesses” are included below to provide comparisons of net sales performance from year to year as if the businesses were combined on January 1, 2016.

2018 Operational Highlights 

•For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales decreased 0.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased 0.1% compared to the prior year. Net sales decreased 1.3% on a constant currency basis including a benefit of 0.5% from net acquisitions. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1.3% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior period.

•For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss attributable to Dentsply Sirona of $1,011.0 million as compared to the net loss attributable to Dentsply Sirona of $1,550.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported a net loss per share of $4.51 per share compared to a net loss per share of $6.76 in the prior year. On an adjusted basis (a non-US GAAP measure as defined under the heading “Net Income attributable to Dentsply Sirona”), full year 2018 net income decreased by $163.7 million or 26.5% compared to the prior year and earnings per diluted share declined 24.3% to $2.01 from $2.66 in the prior year.

•On November 5, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to restructure the Company’s business to support revenue growth and margin expansion and to simplify its organization. The Company expects to incur approximately $275 million in one-time expenditures and charges.

BUSINESS

The Company operates in two reporting segments, Technologies & Equipment and Consumables.

The Technologies & Equipment segment is responsible for the worldwide design, manufacture, sales and distribution of the Company’s Dental Technology & Equipment Products and Healthcare Consumable Products. These products include dental implants, laboratory dental products, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers as well as consumable medical device products.

The Consumables segment includes responsibility for the worldwide design, manufacture, sales and distribution of the Company’s Dental Consumable Products which include preventive, restorative, endodontic and orthodontic dental products, dental handpieces, and instruments.

Principal Measurements

The principal measurements used by the Company in evaluating its business are: (1) constant currency sales growth by segment and geographic region; (2) internal sales growth by segment and geographic region; and (3) adjusted operating income and margins of each reportable segment, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, corporate expenses, and certain other items to enhance the comparability of results period to period. These principal measurements are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; therefore, these items represent non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

The Company defines “constant currency” sales growth as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period excluding precious metal content and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This impact is calculated by comparing current-period revenues to prior-period revenues, with both periods converted at the U.S. dollar to local currency foreign exchange rate for each month of the prior period, for the currencies in which the Company does business. The Company defines “internal” sales growth as constant currency sales growth excluding the impacts of net acquisitions and divestitures, Merger accounting impacts and discontinued products.

Business Drivers

The primary drivers of internal growth include macroeconomic factors, global dental market growth, innovation and new product launches by the Company, as well as continued investments in sales and marketing resources, including clinical education. Management believes that the Company’s ability to execute its strategies should allow it to grow faster than the underlying dental market over time. On a short term basis, changes in strategy or distributor inventory levels can impact internal growth.

The Company has a focus on maximizing operational efficiencies on a global basis. The Company has expanded the use of technology as well as process improvement initiatives to enhance global efficiency. In addition, management continues to evaluate the consolidation of operations and functions, as part of integration activities, to further reduce costs. While the current period results continue to reflect the unfavorable impact of incomplete integration related activities, the Company believes that the future benefits from these global efficiency and integration initiatives will improve its cost structure. In 2017, the Company targeted a cost reduction initiative of approximately $100 million expected to be achieved over the next several years as the benefits of these initiatives, net of related investments, are realized over time. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company achieved cost savings of approximately $50 million related to this target. The Company expects to realize the remainder of the cost savings through the restructuring plan noted below.

On November 5, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to restructure the Company’s business to support revenue growth and margin expansion and to simplify its organization, with the understanding that such restructuring plan may continue to evolve as the Company progresses through the continued planning and execution of the plan. The plan includes a restructuring of the business through streamlining the Company's organization and consolidating functions. The restructuring plan anticipates a net reduction in the Company’s global workforce of approximately 6% to 8%, and the Company will consult with employee representation in connection with the execution of the restructuring plan where required. The Company anticipates that the restructuring will result in annualized topline growth of 3% to 4%, an adjusted operating income margin of 20% by the end of the year 2020, an adjusted operating income margin of 22% by the year 2022 and approximately $225 million in net annual cost savings by 2021. The Company expects to incur approximately $275 million in one-time expenditures and charges through 2021. There can be no assurance that the cost reductions and results will be achieved.

As part of this restructuring plan, the Company is creating more meaningful solutions for dentists built around innovative products and differentiated clinical education. In order to achieve this goal, the Company introduced five key operating principles:

•Approach customers as one: Put the customer at the center of how Dentsply Sirona is organized. The Company is creating one integrated approach to customer service, direct and indirect selling, and clinical education to strengthen the relationship with the customer and better serve the customers' needs.

•Assume greater responsibility for Dentsply Sirona’s demand creation: To better support dealer partners and end-user customers, the Company launched a sales force effectiveness program, with a view to improving returns on sales and marketing investments.

•Ensure that innovation is substantial and supported: Create a comprehensive R&D program that prioritizes spending across the entire Company portfolio resulting in more impactful innovations each year.

•Lead in clinical education: Dentsply Sirona is investing to further its leadership position through local training events and enhancing online training presence to strengthen the relationship with the dental professionals.

•Take advantage of scale:  The Company is focused on integrating its dental product portfolios to unlock operational efficiencies, including performance improvements in procurement, logistics, manufacturing, sales force and marketing programs. In addition, Dentsply Sirona is taking significant measures to simplify the business. In combination, these initiatives will improve organizational efficiency and better leverage the Company’s selling, general and administrative infrastructure.

Product innovation is a key component of the Company’s overall growth strategy. New advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in the dentistry and consumable medical device markets in which the Company operates. As a result, the Company continues to pursue research and development initiatives to support technological development, including collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools. In addition, the Company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties. Although the Company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental, healthcare consumable and dental technology products, they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed.

The Company will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the Company’s product offerings, technologies and sales and service infrastructure through partnerships and acquisitions. Although the professional dental and the consumable medical device markets in which the Company operates have experienced consolidation, they remain fragmented. Management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future.

The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income. Price increases, promotional activities as well as changes in inventory levels at distributors contribute to this fluctuation. The Company typically implements most of its price increases in October or January of a given year across most of its businesses. Distributor inventory levels tend to increase in the period leading up to a price increase and decline in the period following the implementation of a price increase. Required minimum purchase commitments under agreements with key distributors may increase inventory levels in excess of retail demand. These net inventory changes have impacted the Company’s consolidated net sales and net income in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, over a given period or multiple periods. In addition, the Company may from time to time, engage in new distributor relationships that could cause quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales and net income. Distributor inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from the Company’s predictions, resulting in the Company’s projections of future results being different than expected. There can be no assurance that the Company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the Company’s predictions or past history, or that the timing of customers’ inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the Company’s predictions or past history. Any of these fluctuations could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

36

During 2018 the Company continued to be impacted by the transition in distribution strategy with Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”) and Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”). In 2017, the Company signed new distribution agreements with Patterson and Henry Schein for the Company’s equipment products. The Company shipped initial stocking orders for the equipment products to Henry Schein under the agreements primarily in the second and third quarters of 2017 which resulted in unfavorable year-over-year sales growth comparisons. Based on the Company’s estimate, year-over-year changes in distributor inventories associated with these agreements negatively impacted the Company’s reported sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $127 million. Based on the Company’s estimate, distributor inventories increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $27 million as compared to a decrease of approximately $100 million for the full year 2018. For more information about the drivers of our business and related risks, see Part I, Item 1, "Business" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Impact of Foreign Currencies and Interest Rates

Due to the Company’s significant international presence, movements in foreign exchange and interest rates may impact the Consolidated Statements of Operations. With approximately two-thirds of the Company’s net sales located in regions outside the United States, the Company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity as a number of the Company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the U.S.

Reclassification of Prior Year Amounts

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years’ data in order to conform to current year presentation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2018 Compared to 2017 

Net Sales

The discussion below summarizes the Company’s net sales growth, excluding precious metal content, applying the following adjustments: (1) constant currency sales growth, which includes internal sales growth and net acquisition sales growth, and (2) foreign currency translation. The discussion below also summarized the Company's adjusted non-US GAAP net sales growth, excluding precious metal content, after applying additional adjustments related to the Merger and other acquisitions. These disclosures provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods.

Management believes that the presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, provides useful information to investors because a portion of Dentsply Sirona’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the Company’s precious metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the cost of the precious metal content of the Company’s sales is largely passed through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, Dentsply Sirona reports net sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. The Company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales, as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change.

The presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and is therefore considered a non-US GAAP measure. The Company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content. The Company’s definitions and calculations of net sales, excluding precious metal content, and other operating measures derived using net sales, excluding precious metal content, may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3,949.1 million, a decrease of $3.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, was negatively impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $127 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors primarily in the United States, which the Company believes is primarily related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). Based on the Company’s estimate, distributor inventories increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $27 million as compared to a decrease of approximately $100 million for the full year 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased 1.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 0.5% from net acquisitions, which leads to negative internal sales growth of 1.8%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were positively impacted by approximately 1.3% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. The negative internal sales growth was attributable to the Technologies & Equipment segment, partially offset by the Consumables segment.

The Company expects that the impact of divestitures of nonstrategic product lines will negatively impact reported net sales by approximately $70 million for the full year of 2019.

United States

Reported net sales decreased by 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was unfavorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $127 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at two distributors in the United States primarily related to the transition in distribution strategy as discussed above. Based on the Company’s estimate, distributor inventories increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $27 million as compared to a decrease of approximately $100 million for the full year 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales, excluding precious metal content, including acquisition related adjustments, decreased 6.8% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 0.9% from net acquisitions which results in a negative internal sales growth rate of 7.7%. The negative internal sales growth in this region was driven by lower sales in the Technologies & Equipment segment. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was impacted as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

Europe

Reported net sales increased by 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 0.3% on a constant currency basis offset by a benefit of 0.3% from net acquisitions. Internal sales growth was led by the Consumables segment, offset by the negative internal sales growth in the Technologies & Equipment segment.

Rest of World

Reported net sales increased by 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 0.4% from net acquisitions, which results in internal sales growth of 3.4%. The internal sales growth in this region was driven by stronger growth in the Consumables segment.

Gross Profit

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 300 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily driven by higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable product pricing including the impact of geographic sales mix, business combination related costs and product line eliminations, and the effect of dealer destocking, which collectively impacted the gross profit rate by approximately 350 basis points, partially offset by the benefit of the Company’s global efficiency initiatives as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

SG&A Expenses

SG&A expenses, including research and development expenses, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 110 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The higher rate was primarily driven by increased compensation costs and selling and marketing expenses as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

Goodwill Impairment

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,085.8 million, related to two reporting units in the Technologies & Equipment segment and one reporting unit within the Consumables segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,650.9 million, related to three reporting units in the Technologies & Equipment segment. For further information see Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Restructuring and Other Costs

The Company recorded net restructuring and other costs of $221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $425.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company recorded $32.1 million in restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $55.4 million in restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded other costs of $188.9 million which consist of impairment charges of $179.2 million and $9.7 million primarily related to legal settlements. For further information on the impairment charges, see Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, and Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, each in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded other costs of $369.8 million which consist of impairment charges of $346.7 million and legal settlements of $23.1 million.

On November 5, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to restructure the Company’s business to support revenue growth and margin expansion and to simplify the organization. The Company anticipates that the restructuring will result in annualized topline growth of 3% to 4%, an adjusted operating income margin of 20% by the end of the year 2020, an adjusted operating income margin of 22% by the year 2022 and approximately $225 million in net annual cost savings by 2021. The Company expects to incur approximately $275 million in one-time expenditures and charges through 2021. There can be no assurance that the cost reductions and results will be achieved.

Other Income and Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not meaningful

Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $0.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Lower average interest rates partially offset by increased debt levels in 2018 when compared to the prior year resulted in the decrease in net interest expense.

Other Expense (Income), Net

Other expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $40.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Other expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes foreign exchange loss of $5.8 million and $40.7 million of other non-operating income including a gain of $44.1 million from the sale of marketable securities. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.3 million, includes foreign exchange loss of $1.7 million and $3.6 million of other non-operating expenses.

Income Taxes and Net Income

Provision for Income Taxes 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, income taxes were a net expense of $52.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded the following discrete tax items: $4.3 million of excess tax benefit related to employee share-based compensation, tax benefit of $3.3 million related to enacted statutory rate changes, tax expense of $8.3 million for other discrete tax matters, $4.1 million tax benefit related to U.S. tax reform, and tax expense of $54.8 million related to valuation allowance on foreign tax credits and other deferred tax assets. The Company also recorded a $50.4 million tax benefit as a discrete item related to the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, $1.1 million for the fixed asset impairment charge, and $3.3 related to tax-deductible goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company also recorded $2.5 million of tax expense as a discrete item related to the gain on sale of marketable securities. Excluding these discrete tax items and adjusting pretax income for the gain on the sale of marketable securities, net of tax and adjusting for the pretax loss related to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and tax deductible and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, the Company’s effective tax rate was 20.0%. Further information regarding the details of income taxes is presented in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act" or "U.S. tax reform") was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% in 2018 from 35%, instituted a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and created a new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for enactment effects of the Act and provides a measurement period of up to one year from the Act’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under Accounting Standards Codification No. 740 “Income Taxes”, (“ASC 740”). In accordance with SAB 118, income tax effects of The Act were refined upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing additional information during the measurement period. At December 31, 2018 the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act.

The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently invested amount to $1,137.2 million at December 31, 2018 and $1,071.1 million at December 31, 2017. The Act imposed U.S. tax on all post-1986 foreign unrepatriated earnings accumulated through December 31, 2017. Unrepatriated earnings generated after December 31, 2017, are now subject to tax in the current year under the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) provision of the Act. All undistributed earnings are still subject to certain taxes upon repatriation, primarily where foreign withholding taxes apply. 

For the GILTI provision of the Act, the Company has made the policy election to record any liability associated with GILTI in the period in which it is incurred.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to issue interpretative guidance and regulations associated with the Act.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2018 included the net impact of restructuring program related costs and other costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, credit risk and fair value adjustments, gain on sale of marketable securities and income tax related adjustments which impacted loss before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $1,544.2 million and $78.7 million, respectively.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2017 included the net impact of restructuring program related costs and other costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted loss before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $2,351.8 million and $183.6 million, respectively.

Net (Loss) Income attributable to Dentsply Sirona

In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”). The Company discloses adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.

Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income and adjusted EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics.

The adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona consists of net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona adjusted to exclude the following:

(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to integrating and consummating mergers and recently acquired businesses, as well as costs, gains and losses related to the disposal of businesses or significant product lines. In addition, this category includes the roll off to the consolidated statements of operations of fair value adjustments related to business combinations, except for amortization expense noted below. These items are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.

43

(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives as well as certain other costs. These costs can include, but are not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract terminations costs, related professional service costs, duplicate facility and labor costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives, as well as, legal settlements and impairments of assets. These items are irregular in timing, amount and impact to the Company’s financial performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and are therefore excluded for the purpose of understanding underlying operating trends.

(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. Amortization expense has been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding these large non-cash charges.

(4) Credit risk and fair value adjustments.  These adjustments include both the cost and income impacts of adjustments in certain assets and liabilities including the Company’s pension obligations, that are recorded through net income which are due solely to the changes in fair value and credit risk. These items can be variable and driven more by market conditions than the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.

(5) Gain on sale of marketable securities. This adjustment represents the gain on the sale of marketable securities held by the Company. The gain has been excluded from adjusted net income attributed to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding this gain.

(6) Income tax related adjustments. These adjustments include both income tax expenses and income tax benefits that are representative of income tax adjustments mostly related to prior periods, as well as the final settlement of income tax audits, and discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact the Company’s operating performance. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.

Adjusted earnings per diluted common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net (loss) income attributable to Dentsply Sirona by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are considered measures not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and therefore are non-US GAAP measures. These non-US GAAP measures may differ from other companies. Income tax related adjustments may include the impact to adjust the interim effective income tax rate to the expected annual effective tax rate.

Adjusted Operating Income and Margin

Adjusted operating income and margin is another important internal measure for the Company. Operating income in accordance with US GAAP is adjusted for the items noted above which are excluded on a pre-tax basis to arrive at adjusted operating income, a non-US GAAP measure. The adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales, excluding precious metal content.

Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted operating income. The performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with the adjusted non-US GAAP earnings noted above as well as other performance metrics. This non-US GAAP measure may differ from other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Technologies & Equipment 

Reported net sales decreased by 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by $61.9 million or 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was negatively impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $127 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors primarily in the United States, that the Company believes is primarily related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). Based on the Company’s estimate, distributor inventories increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $27 million as compared to a decrease of approximately $100 million for the full year 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased 4.2% on a constant currency basis, or negative internal sales growth of 4.2%. The decline in internal sales growth was driven by the U.S., partially offset by internal sales growth in Rest of World region.

The operating income decreased $157.0 million or 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. The decrease is primarily the result of the net change in equipment inventory at certain distributors, higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable product pricing, higher selling and marketing investments, as well as unfavorable product mix as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

Consumables 

Reported net sales increased by 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by $58.1 million or 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. 

47

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales, excluding precious metal, including acquisition related adjustments, increased 2.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.1% from net acquisitions which results in internal growth of 1.2%. The internal sales growth was primarily driven by the Rest of World and Europe, partially offset by a decrease in the United States.

The operating income increased $2.8 million or 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase is primarily related to higher sales volume and product pricing as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2017 Compared to 2016 

Net Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3,952.9 million, an increase of $271.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, reflects sales of $112.7 million as a result of the consolidation of two additional months of Sirona for the year end December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period. This excludes approximately $4.0 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was favorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $23 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors in North America and Europe, that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). Based on the Company’s estimate, inventory held by these distributors increased by approximately $26 million during the current year compared to an increase of approximately $3 million in 2016. The inventory increase in 2017 was more than anticipated, in the Company’s assessment, as a result of lower equipment sales to end-users as well as higher than anticipated stocking of inventory by distributors in the U.S.

Sales related to precious metal content declined 37.0% during 2017, which was primarily related to the continued reduction in the use of precious metal alloys in dentistry.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 1.6% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.8% from net acquisitions which leads to negative internal sales growth of 20 basis points. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1.0% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Based on the Company's assessment, the internal sales growth was benefited by approximately 60 basis points as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year other the prior year as discussed above. A reconciliation of reported net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content, of the combined business for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectfully, is as follows:

United States

Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was favorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $42 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at two distributors in the United States related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). This excludes approximately $4.0 million of revenue that was eliminated in fair value purchase accounting adjustments to deferred income. 

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses declined 0.5% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 1.1% from net acquisitions and was unfavorably impacted by discontinued products by approximately 10 basis points, which results in a negative internal sales growth rate of 1.5%. The negative internal sales growth in this region was driven by lower demand in the Technologies & Equipment segment. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was benefited by approximately 3% as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

Reported net sales, increased by 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was unfavorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $9 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at a certain distributor in Europe that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail).

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 4.1% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 2.3% from net acquisitions, which results in internal sales growth of 1.8%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were positively impacted by approximately 2.2% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. Internal sales growth in this region was primarily driven by higher demand in both segments. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

Rest of World

Reported net sales increased by 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was unfavorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $10 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at a certain distributor in Canada that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). 

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses grew 0.8% on a constant currency basis. This includes a benefit of 2.2% from net acquisitions, which results in negative internal sales growth of 1.4%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were positively impacted by approximately 0.9% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the prior year period. The negative internal sales growth in this region was driven by lower demand in the Technologies & Equipment segment. Based on the Company’s assessment, the internal sales growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1% as a result of the net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year over the prior year as discussed above. The impact from net changes in inventory levels was entirely within the Technologies & Equipment segment.

Gross Profit

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Improvement in the gross profit rate for year ended December 31, 2017, were primarily driven by net reductions in the roll-off of merger-related fair value adjustments and expenses of approximately 150 basis points as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points associated with the equipment businesses primarily as a result of lower sales related to the transition in distribution strategy as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

SG&A Expenses

SG&A expenses, including research and developing expenses, as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 100 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.The higher rate was primarily driven by increased professional service costs, biennial trade show and other selling events, unfavorable foreign currency and increased amortization and depreciation which unfavorably impacted the rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the rate was also unfavorably impact by 80 basis points due to employment agreement costs related to the resignation of senior management compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in business combination related costs which favorably impacted the rate by 120 basis points as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Goodwill impairment

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,650.9 million. The charge is related to three reporting units in the Technologies & Equipment segment. For further information see Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Restructuring and Other Costs

The Company recorded net restructuring and other costs of $425.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

The Company recorded net restructuring expense of $55.4 million related to restructuring initiatives in Germany and organizational management changes announced during the fourth quarter. As announced in October 2016, the Company proposed plans in Germany to reorganize and combine portions of its manufacturing, logistics and distribution networks within the Company’s two segments. As required under German law, the Company entered into a statutory co-determination process under which it collaborated with the appropriate labor groups to jointly define the infrastructure and staffing adjustments necessary to support this initiative. In 2017, the Company received all necessary approvals and is proceeding with its current plans. The Company estimates the cost of these initiatives to be approximately $65 million, primarily for severance related benefits for employees, which is expected to be incurred as actions are implemented over the next two years. The Company recorded costs of approximately $29 million associated with these plans. The Company estimates that the future annual savings related to these plans to be in the range of $11 million to $14 million to be realized over the next one to three years. There is no assurance that future savings will be fully achieved.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded other costs of $369.8 million which consist of impairment charges of $346.7 million and legal settlements of $23.1 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income taxes were a net benefit of $53.2 million. During the year, the Company recorded the following discrete tax items, $20.5 million of excess tax benefit related to employee share based compensation, tax expense of $12.0 million related primarily to state valuation allowances, $3.6 million related to enacted statutory rate changes, $1.0 million related to other discrete tax matters and $20.1 million related to US Tax Reform. The Company also recorded a $99.1 million tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment charge recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding these discrete tax items and adjusting pretax loss to exclude the pretax loss related to the impairment of the intangible assets and non-deductible goodwill impairment charge the Company’s effective tax rate was 7.54%. The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the Company’s change in the mix of consolidated earnings. Further information regarding the details of income taxes is presented in Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act" or "U.S. tax reform") was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% in 2018 from 35%, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and creates a new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for enactment effects of SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the Act’s enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under Accounting Standards Codification No. 740 “Income Taxes”, (“ASC 740”). In accordance with SAB 118, to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in its financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in its financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Act. The Company’s accounting for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but the Company has determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a net provisional income tax charge of $20.1 million, which is included as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Based on information available, the Company estimated the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings to be approximately $1.1 billion and recorded a provisional estimate of $62.2 million of income tax expense related to the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. There is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act, in particular as it relates to state income taxes. Further, the Company has not yet completed the analysis of the components of the computation, including the amount of the foreign earnings subject to U.S. income tax, and the portion of the foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets. As of December 31, 2017, primarily due to the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain other tax attributes the estimated cash liability for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $1.0 million. However, as the Company completes its analysis an additional liability could be recorded and the Company would elect to make installment payments as allowed under the Act. 

As a result of the Act, the Company can repatriate the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. The Company is still evaluating whether to change its indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under SAB 118.

The remaining provisional amount is a benefit of $42.1 million relating to the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liabilities. For the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) provision of the Act, a provisional estimate could not be made as the Company has not yet completed its assessment or elected an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or to record GILTI as period costs if and when incurred. 

In accordance with SEC guidance, provisional amounts may be refined as a result of additional guidance from, and interpretations by, U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies, and changes in assumptions. In the subsequent period, provisional amounts will be adjusted for the effects, if any, of interpretative guidance issued after January 19, 2018, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act may be subject to changes for items that were previously reported as provisional amounts, as well as any element of the 2017 Tax Act that a provisional estimate could not be made, and such changes could be material.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2017 included the net impact of restructuring program related costs and other costs, amortization of purchased intangible assets, business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted loss before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $2,351.8 million and $183.6 million, respectively.

The Company’s effective income tax rate for 2016 included the net impact of business combination related costs and fair value adjustments, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring program related costs and other costs, credit risk and fair value adjustments and income tax related adjustments which impacted income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes by $340.3 million and $153.1 million, respectively.

Net (loss) income attributable to Dentsply Sirona

In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, the Company provides adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona and adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”). The Company discloses adjusted net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona to allow investors to evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period and may not be indicative of past or future performance of the normal operations of the Company and certain large non-cash charges related to intangible assets either purchased or acquired through a business combination. The Company believes that this information is helpful in understanding underlying operating trends and cash flow generation.

Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes adjusted net income and adjusted EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics.

Reported net sales increased by 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Reported net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased by $173.9 million or 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects sales of $98.6 million as a result of the inclusion of two additional months of Sirona for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net sales, excluding precious metal content, was favorably impacted, based on the Company’s estimate, by approximately $23 million as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors in North America and Europe, that the Company believes is related to the transition in distribution strategy (see “Business Drivers” under this section for further detail). Based on the Company’s estimate, inventory held by these distributors increased by approximately $26 million during the current year compared to an increase of approximately $3 million in 2016. The inventory increase in 2017 was more than anticipated, in the Company’s assessment, as a result of lower equipment sales to end-users as well as higher than anticipated stocking of inventory by distributors in the U.S.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our combined businesses declined 0.1% on a constant currency basis. This

 includes a benefit of approximately 2.7% from net acquisitions, which results in negative internal sales growth of 2.8%. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, were favorably impacted by approximately 1.0% due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to the prior year. Sales decline was led by the U.S. and the Rest of World regions, partially offset by Europe. The negative internal sales growth rate, based on the Company’s estimate, was favorably impacted by changes in equipment inventory levels in the current year as compared to the prior year at certain distributors related to the transition in distribution strategy.

The operating income increased $56.9 million or 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 reflects the impact of the consolidation of two additional months of Sirona, and the savings from the Company’s global efficiency and integration program. Based on the Company’s assessment, operating income was favorably impacted by the change in net equipment inventory as discussed above.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND POLICIES

The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix and in some cases, actuarial techniques. The Company evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate. Some events as described below could cause results to differ significantly from those determined using estimates. The Company has identified the following accounting estimates as those which are critical to its business and results of operations.

Business Acquisitions 

The Company acquires businesses as well as partial interests in businesses. Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the Company to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values with the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair values recorded as goodwill. The assumptions made in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as asset lives can materially impact the results of operations.

The Company obtains information during due diligence and through other sources to get respective fair values. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to determine the fair values include: tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals; evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities and product line integration information. If the initial valuation for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the quarter in which the acquisition occurred, the Company will record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. The provisional estimate will be finalized as soon as information becomes available but will only occur up to one year from the acquisition date.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets

The Company follows the accounting standards for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, which require an annual test for impairment to goodwill using a fair value approach. In addition to minimum annual impairment tests, the Company also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite-lived assets might be impaired. If impairment related to goodwill is identified, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Other Long-Lived Assets

Other long-lived assets, such as definite-lived intangible assets and fixed assets, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with US GAAP, these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If impaired based on the identifiable undiscounted cash flows, the asset’s fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and market participant assumptions. The resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value.

59

Impairment Assessment

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets is an integral part of the Company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions, particularly changes in the Company’s discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges. Information with respect to the Company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill and other long-lived assets are included in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing

Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. The valuation date for annual impairment testing is April 30. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.

Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company has several reporting units contained within each operating segment. 

The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including future sales growth, operating margin growth, benefits from restructuring initiatives, tax rates, capital spending, business initiatives, and working capital changes. These assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units. Operating cash flow forecasts are based on approved business-unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections in later years. The weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) rate is estimated for geographic regions and applied to the reporting units located within the regions. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of the Company’s recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the Company’s impairment analysis.

Should the Company’s analysis in the future indicate an increase in discount rates or a degradation in the overall markets served by these reporting units, it could result in impairment of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. There can be no assurance that the Company’s future goodwill impairment testing will not result in a charge to earnings.

Annual Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing

Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of tradenames and trademarks and are not subject to amortization; instead, they are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flow projections, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of indefinite-lived assets.

60

The fair value of acquired tradenames and trademarks is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, which values an indefinite-lived intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. Under this method, an owner of an indefinite-lived intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. Royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation.  The royalty rate, which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted at present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. Management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions, including projected revenue, royalty rates and appropriate discount rates. Royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for the original purchase accounting valuation. Other assumptions are consistent with those applied to goodwill impairment testing.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Results

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill at April 30, 2018 on eleven reporting units. To determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model with market-based support as its valuation technique to measure the fair value for its reporting units. The discounted cash flow model uses five- to ten-year forecasted cash flows plus a terminal value based on a multiple of earnings or by capitalizing the last period’s cash flows using a perpetual growth rate. In the development of the forecasted cash flows, the Company applies revenue, gross profit, and operating expense assumptions taking into consideration historical trends as well as futures expectations. These future expectations include, but are not limited to, new product development and distribution channel changes for the respective reporting units. The Company also considers the current and projected market conditions for dental and medical device industries, both in the U.S. and globally, when determining its assumptions. The total forecasted cash flows were discounted based on market participant data, which included assumptions regarding the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The Company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, the weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business and working capital effects. A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Goodwill Testing Results

In connection with the updating of the estimates and assumptions with the annual impairment tests of goodwill and the preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company determined that the goodwill associated with the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Orthodontics reporting units was impaired. Additionally, near the end of the quarter, the Company recognized that the CAD/CAM and Imaging reporting units’ (“equipment reporting units”) revenue and operating margins would not meet forecasted expectations for the quarter as a result of several significant unfavorable developments which also affected the reporting units’ projections for future revenue and operating margins. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,085.8 million. The CAD/CAM and Imaging reporting units are within the Technologies & Equipment segment and the Orthodontics reporting unit is within the Consumables segment. The significant unfavorable developments in the current period which are reflected in the Company’s April 30, 2018 goodwill impairment testing model, are as follows:

•The equipment reporting units were negatively affected in connection with the continued transition of the Company’s distribution relationships primarily in the U.S. from exclusive to non-exclusive.  The Company’s expectations for revenue growth from its non-exclusive distribution relationships, which replaced its former long-term exclusive distribution relationship, were not met. As a result, the Company’s forecasts of current and future third-party demand have been reduced as the Company’s U.S. distributors continue to offer and promote competitive alternatives to the Company’s full CAD/CAM systems and lower-priced alternatives to the Imaging reporting units’ products.

•The Imaging reporting unit observed revenue and operating margins being negatively impacted by aggressive competition with a focus on value-based products in the marketplace as opposed to the reporting unit’s premium products.  This has resulted in increased competition from low-cost products in certain regions throughout the world causing the reporting unit to offer additional product features at the current price levels and to offer additional promotions and reduce its future sales forecasts. 

•The CAD/CAM and Imaging reporting units have also experienced lower than expected sales with respect to higher margin products as well as a regional shift in sales to emerging markets each of which has negatively impacted the reporting units’ overall operating margins as compared to the original forecasts for the period and for future sales forecasts.

61

•The equipment reporting units were also further impacted by the unfavorable change in the discount rate due primarily to a higher risk factor, which represents management’s assessment of increased risk with respect to the CAD/CAM and Imaging reporting units’ forecasts primarily due to the factors described above, and to a lesser extent a higher risk-free interest rate for all reporting units.

•The increased reduction of inventory being held by the Company’s U.S. distributors in the second quarter, which was larger than anticipated for the period, and planned further reductions of inventory, impacts the Company’s near-term results. 

As a result of the factors described above, and the resulting reduced revenue and profitability expectations for these reporting units, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and operating margins and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of these reporting units, which resulted in a determination that an impairment adjustment was required. 

The Orthodontics reporting unit goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by lower operating margins and lower sales growth. The products manufactured and sold within this reporting unit have consisted mainly of traditional orthodontic treatment products, (i.e., brackets, bands and wires). The impairment charge is unrelated to the Company’s acquisition of OraMetrix. The Company has observed a continuing decline in operating margins as the marketplace has seen higher than expected price competition primarily due to increased supply of traditional orthodontic products in the market. In addition, the Company has seen lower than expected revenue growth which is reflected in its future forecast. The Company believes the revenue trend is the result of competition as well as the growing end-user demand for newer orthodontic treatment options. 

For the Company’s reporting units that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis. Had the discount rate of each of these reporting units been hypothetically increased by 100 basis points at April 30, 2018, the fair value of one reporting unit, Treatment Centers, would not exceed net book value. If the fair value of each of these reporting units had been hypothetically reduced by 10% at April 30, 2018, the fair value of one reporting unit, Treatment Centers, would not exceed net book value. Goodwill for that reporting unit totals $292.4 million at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2018, the Company did not identify any impairment triggers related to the reporting units noted above.

Indefinite-lived and Definite-lived Intangible Assets Testing Results

The Company also assessed the annual impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 30, 2018, which largely consist of acquired tradenames and trademarks, in conjunction with the annual impairment tests of goodwill. As a result of the annual impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $179.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 which was recorded in Restructuring and other costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impaired indefinite-lived intangible assets are tradenames and trademarks related to the CAD/CAM, Imaging, and Instrument reporting units. The impairment charge was primarily driven by a decline in forecasted sales resulting from increased competition and the impact of low-cost competitive products, as discussed above with respect to goodwill. In addition, the unfavorable impact of an increase in the equipment reporting units’ respective risk factors, along with increases in the risk-free rate, increased the discount rate. The assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets contain uncertainties, and any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment. At December 31, 2018, the Company did not identify any impairment triggers for the indefinite-lived assets related to the reporting units noted above.

For the Company’s indefinite-lived assets that were not impaired, the Company applied a hypothetical sensitivity analysis. If the fair value of each of these indefinite-lived intangibles assets had been hypothetically reduced by 10% or the discount rate had been hypothetically increased by 50 basis points at April 30, 2018, the fair value of these assets would still exceed their book value.

Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations. The Company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are typically in the form of ranges, and the Company records the liabilities at the low point of the ranges, when no other point within the ranges is a better estimate of the probable loss. The ranges established by management are based on analysis made by internal and external legal counsel based on information known at the time. If the Company determines a liability to be only reasonably possible, it considers the same information to estimate the possible exposure and discloses any material potential liability. These loss contingencies are monitored regularly for a change in fact or circumstance that would require an accrual adjustment. The Company believes it has appropriately estimated liabilities for probable losses in the past; however, the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates. Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The Company’s tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested.

The Company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes in the financial statements, tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.

Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely. At December 31, 2018, the Company has a valuation allowance of $288.4 million against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries.

The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions. The reversal of accruals is recorded when examinations are completed, statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $499.8 million compared to $601.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income increased by $539.4 million in the period ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, largely from lower non-cash impairments of goodwill and intangible assets. Working capital consumed $4.0 million of operating cash flow in 2018 compared to $149.3 million consumed in 2017. Other non-cash charges decreased approximately $75.7 million versus the prior year, largely driven by decreased share based compensation, restructuring, and legal settlements. The Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $309.6 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, on a constant currency basis, the number of days for sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased by 2 days to 59 days as compared to 61 days in 2017. On a constant currency basis, the number of days of sales in inventory decreased by 7 days to 124 days at December 31, 2018 as compared to 131 days at December 31, 2017.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included capital expenditures of $182.5 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets of $136.0 million. The Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $165 million to $175 million for the full year 2019.

Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to dividend payments of $78.6 million and share repurchases of $250.2 million, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $27.9 million and net change in borrowings of $51.1 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase program for a total authorization of $1.0 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased 5.4 million shares or $250.2 million at an average price of $45.92. Share repurchases will be made through open market purchases, Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or other transactions in such amounts and at such times as the Company deems appropriate based upon prevailing market and business conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held 41.5 million and 37.7 million shares, respectively, of treasury stock. The Company received proceeds of $28.0 million as a result of the exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Total debt increased by $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Dentsply Sirona's long-term debt, including the current portion, at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1,575.5 million and $1,620.8 million, respectively. The Company's long-term debt, including the current portion decreased by a net of $45.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. This net change included a net decrease in borrowings of $34.6 million, and a decrease of $10.7 million due to exchange rate fluctuations on debt denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was $67.8 and $7.3 million, respectively, outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's ratio of net debt to total capitalization increased to 20.8% compared to 16.6% at December 31, 2017. Dentsply Sirona defines net debt as total debt, including current and long-term portions, less cash and cash equivalents and total capitalization as the sum of net debt plus total equity.

The Company has access to $700.0 million revolving credit facility through July 27, 2023. The facility is unsecured and contains certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the operations and financial condition of the Company. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income plus depreciation and amortization to interest expense.

The Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans and senior notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the Company's operations and financial condition. These credit agreements contain a number of covenants and two financial ratios, which the Company is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of total debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 0.6 to 1.0, and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 3.0 times, in each case, as such terms are defined in the relevant agreement. Any breach of any such covenants or ratios would result in a default under the existing debt agreements that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle the Company's other lenders to accelerate their loans. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

64

The Company also has access to $44.6 million in uncommitted short-term financing under lines of credit from various financial institutions. The lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the Company and the lending institutions. At December 31, 2018, $14.0 million was outstanding under these short-term lines of credit. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total unused lines of credit related to the revolving credit agreement and the uncommitted short-term lines of credit of $662.8 million.

The Company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance cash requirements, including capital expenditures, cash payments related to restructuring programs, debt service, operating leases and potential future acquisitions, from the current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities. The Company estimates cash payments related to recently announced restructuring to be in a range from $115 million to $125 million in 2019. The Company's credit facilities are further discussed in Note 12, Financing Arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. The Company intends to pay or refinance the current portion of long term debt due in 2019 utilizing cash or available credit. As noted in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K, the Company has continued to generate strong cash flows from operations, which has been used to finance the Company's activities.

At December 31, 2018, the majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States. The majority of the Company’s excess free cash flow is generated outside of the United States. Most of the foreign excess free cash flow could be repatriated to the United States. The Company expects to repatriate its foreign excess free cash flow (the amount in excess of capital investment and acquisition needs), subject to current regulations, to fund ongoing operations and capital needs. Historically, the Company has generated more than sufficient operating cash flows in the United States to fund domestic operations. Further, the Company expects on an ongoing basis, to be able to finance domestic and international cash requirements, including capital expenditures, stock repurchases, debt service, operating leases and potential future acquisitions, from the funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities.

As a result of U.S. tax reform, $271.7 million of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries was subject to current tax in the U.S. in 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has repatriated $106.0 million of the $271.7 million that was taxed under the Act. To the extent the Company repatriates funds to the U.S., the Company may be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on these amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2018, the Company held $42.2 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions. Under these consignment arrangements, the financial institutions own the precious metal, and, accordingly, the Company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These consignment agreements allow the Company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time, which is approximately the same time, and for the same price as alloys are sold to the Company's customers. In the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements, and if the Company could not obtain other comparable arrangements, the Company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position to maintain precious metal inventory at operational levels. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk - Consignment Arrangements" of this Form 10-K.

65

Contractual Obligations

The following table presents the Company's scheduled contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority; therefore, $31.9 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
